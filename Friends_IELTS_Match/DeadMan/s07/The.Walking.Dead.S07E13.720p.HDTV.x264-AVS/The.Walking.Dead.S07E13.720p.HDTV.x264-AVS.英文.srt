1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,310
Previously, on AMC's The Walking Dead.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,660
We have people, and weapons.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,800
If we strike first, together, we can beat them.

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,340
People will die.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,340
A lot of people, and not just the Saviors.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,640
If we can find another way, we have to.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,810
Just because you now know how to fight, doesn't mean you should seek one.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,820
You'll just have to convince Ezekiel to bring The Kingdom to fight.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,960
No, this is something I am not a part of.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,300
Ah, it looks light.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,170
Perhaps you might look again, Gavin.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,820
We've met our obligations.

13
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,760
God damn it.

14
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,520
Wake it up, kid.

15
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,950
Why does it have to be so early?

16
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
Got a lot to do today.

17
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,860
You want to go back to sleep?

18
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,440
No way.

19
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,340
You said you wanted to be able to knock your brother

20
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,410
on his butt when you first came to me.

21
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,780
That really what you want?

22
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,580
Yeah.

23
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,030
No.

24
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,870
You want to be like your brother.

25
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,830
Yeah?

26
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,980
Yeah. ?

27
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,360
All right.

28
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,940
Check your feet,

29
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,090
- 'cause if your feet ain't right -- - Nothing's right.

30
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,520
We were just about to come out to clear the --

31
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Where's Morgan?

32
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
- You okay? - Where is Morgan?

33
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,620
Why did Jesus bring Daryl and everyone else to the Kingdom?

34
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,600
They, um...

35
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,110
They wanted to see if we could all start working together on things.

36
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,330
The Saviors are still here.

37
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,380
They're not fighting with the Kingdom, but...

38
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,930
Daryl said they beat them back in Alexandria.

39
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,910
Is that true?

40
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,510
That they made a deal with them?

41
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,850
Is everyone okay?

42
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,120
Just tell me if it's true.

43
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,080
You need to talk to Daryl about that.

44
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,340
You wanted me to keep the whole story about you from everybody.

45
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,040
Told me not to say where you were,

46
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,410
and I did what you asked.

47
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,030
Daryl didn't find you because of me.

48
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,410
And what was said between you and him

49
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,920
was said between you and him.

50
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,780
I will go with you to Alexandria,

51
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,260
if you want to make the trip...

52
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,510
if you want to talk to him.

53
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
You shouldn't go alone.

54
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,950
You found what you wanted, right?

55
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,140
You got away from everyone.

56
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,650
Is it what you wanted?

57
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,620
Was it just too late to get away?

58
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,130
Hey, we can leave for Alexandria right now.

59
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,470
Right now, if you want to.

60
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,370
Is there anything I can help you with?

61
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,440
- No. - ?Well, can I just --

62
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,590
If you don't mind, could I walk back to the cottage with you?

63
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,330
No!

64
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,920
We have a drop today, but I can miss it.

65
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,850
I just...

66
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,230
I'm trying to learn,

67
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,670
and seeing what you did here, I...

68
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,080
There were five of them.

69
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,870
I would just really appreciate it

70
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,350
if you would just...let me see how you do what you do.

71
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,930
No. Go do your drop.

72
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,660
Okay.

73
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,320
You may approach, Nabila.

74
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,940
I'm fine where I am.

75
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,040
Shiva likes you.

76
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,120
That's what I'm afraid of.

77
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,750
Tell me what you found.

78
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,520
You're not gonna like it.

79
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,930
I like waiting to hear bad news less.

80
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,340
We got a little problem

81
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,980
that could turn into a big problem inside of a week.

82
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,280
Most of the plants down there, they got weevils.

83
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,840
We have to cut and burn everything

84
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,800
before the weevils get to the main crops in the courtyard.

85
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,910
I know the Royal Garden is important to you.

86
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,310
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,200
Thank you, Nabila.

88
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,610
Do what must be done.

89
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,730
Here's the beautiful thing, Your Majesty --

90
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,260
you can tear it out and cut it down.

91
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,440
You can burn it and throw it all away.

92
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,060
But if you want, it can all grow back.

93
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,750
Okay. I think I just pissed myself.

94
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,900
I'm-a gonna go.

95
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,890
We're at "five minutes go."

96
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,180
Okay.

97
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,480
Thank you for this.

98
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm still thinking about it.

99
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,380
"To injure an opponent is to injure oneself."

100
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,390
Get injured no matter what.

101
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,370
I got something for you -- for the new place.

102
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,020
Thanks.

103
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,840
I found it at a restaurant I was scavenging.

104
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,550
I know a girl, and she, uh, fixed it up for me.

105
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,540
There.

106
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,140
I was getting tired of looking at that nail.

107
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,970
So, who's the girl?

108
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,690
We're at, like, "three minutes go" right now,

109
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,470
so...

110
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,000
Kid's too young to be a father.

111
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,210
Were you one?

112
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,160
I was, thank God.

113
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,850
But I wasn't too young --

114
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,290
perfect age, perfect time.

115
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,150
I had myself the perfect family and the perfect life.

116
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,050
I didn't ask for much, and I got more than I deserved.

117
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,790
And you?

118
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,760
I'm sorry for how things have been between you and me.

119
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,510
I think you're wrong about killing...

120
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,430
about how you think things can last like this with the Saviors.

121
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,110
But I'm sorry.

122
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,430
I know you're a good man.

123
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,380
The day's coming where you can't be that good.

124
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,710
When that happens,

125
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,370
don't beat yourself up about it.

126
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,190
Benjamin, it's time for us to take our leave.

127
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,880
See you, little man.

128
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,660
Leave the cobbler.

129
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,840
Really?

130
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,690
Jerry.

131
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,710
Fine.

132
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,480
Who's the girl?

133
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,450
Everyone stay down. Get your guns up.

134
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,790
Somebody blocked the road.

135
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,870
Can't be for anything good.

136
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,680
Your Majesty, stay inside.

137
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,450
Take a look if you want,

138
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,830
but keep your guns up.

139
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,150
Echelon right.

140
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,200
Force towards the building over there.

141
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,990
Let's close around the king.

142
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,200
I got cover.

143
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,170
Let's move towards the building.

144
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,730
Benjamin, get your gun up.

145
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,610
Think that's high enough?

146
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,100
You're fine, man.

147
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,070
Jesus...

148
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,630
This world drives one mad.

149
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,460
People have lived through every kind of misery...

150
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,920
tyrants, genocide, systems of quiet hate...

151
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,040
while others enjoy freedom on the same piece of land.

152
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,520
Yet this, how we must exist now...

153
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,760
It is mere luck we are not all insane.

154
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,980
It isn't luck, Your Majesty.

155
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,110
How's that?

156
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,090
The world does drive people crazy now.

157
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,030
But...

158
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,770
you made us another world.

159
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,880
You're late.

160
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,910
If you could indulge us your pardon, our path...

161
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,670
I don't want to hear about it.

162
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,500
Don't interrupt the king.

163
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,800
You rat-faced prick.

164
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,120
Ezekiel, there aren't any kings,

165
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,330
presidents, or prime ministers.

166
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,290
And all that is a fairy tale, too.

167
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,880
Don't bring that "Your Highness" Shit our way.

168
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,110
Now, I appreciate that you've been delivering, but...

169
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,040
things have been unnecessarily tense,

170
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,590
and that makes me unnecessarily tense.

171
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,960
I didn't go this route for stress.

172
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,780
No. Just the opposite.

173
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,970
So let's get to it. Do you have today's offering?

174
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,380
I want your guns, too.

175
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,590
We did not agree to that.

176
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,700
Well, you got a choice...

177
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,110
Same one that's been there since the beginning, I guess.

178
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,080
You can give up your guns,

179
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,090
or you can try to use them.

180
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
What's it gonna be?

181
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,080
We should give them over, Your Majesty.

182
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,390
"Ehh, we should give 'em over, Your Majesty".

183
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,790
Or maybe I'll just shove this down your throat.

184
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,700
Give Morgan his stick back.

185
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,540
Then you can have the guns.

186
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,990
- And all of us can go on with our day's journeys. - Ezekiel...

187
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,680
I need you to understand the gravity of what's happening here.

188
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,350
I gave you a choice.

189
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,900
What is it going to be?

190
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,800
Come on.

191
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,410
You know the answer.

192
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,560
It's fine.

193
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,620
Give them your guns.

194
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
We took your guns just now

195
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,330
because things are about to get emotional.

196
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,380
You guys have proven

197
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,340
that you don't do so good with emotional.

198
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,520
You're short.

199
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,720
We said 12. I count 11.

200
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,960
There are 12 there.

201
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,680
- There aren't. - Count again.

202
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,130
You count them!

203
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,950
I counted them.

204
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,420
I did. T-This is impossible.

205
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
It's possible.

206
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,030
It's real.

207
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,780
It's happening now.

208
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,770
And the problems have to end...now.

209
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,880
You have to learn the stakes here,

210
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,580
so we're gonna teach you.

211
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,490
You don't have to do anything.

212
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,170
We'll get you twice the tribute in an hour.

213
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,830
Right now...

214
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,310
is the only time that matters.

215
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,430
And right now...

216
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,260
you haven't held up your side of the bargain.

217
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,010
After we have talked about things,

218
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,620
over and over again and again.

219
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,880
So we're gonna deal with all of this...

220
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,930
right now.

221
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,730
Right now as in..."right now"?

222
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,970
Yeah.

223
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,120
Right...now.

224
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,280
Just do it.

225
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,260
Okay.

226
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,920
No!

227
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,550
No!

228
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,930
Everybody settle down!

229
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,590
We need to get Benjamin back to the Kingdom.

230
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,210
Give the man his damn stick!

231
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,510
Get in the truck! Don't say a goddamn word!

232
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,330
- We need to get back. ?- No.

233
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,330
Right now, you have to listen.

234
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,610
For once, be present and listen.

235
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,830
You will make your deliveries on time,

236
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,110
every time, and they will be complete.

237
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,820
It's A's or F's, no I's.

238
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,020
You are gonna show me that you understand

239
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,270
by bringing the balance of what you owe tomorrow.

240
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,180
We need to go! He's bleeding out!

241
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,920
One cantaloupe, not more, not less!

242
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,180
Do you understand?!

243
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,530
Yes, I understand.

244
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,550
- Go patch him up. - Okay.

245
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,290
Dianne, we need to drive to Carol's!

246
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,310
We loaded her up with medical supplies!

247
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,420
We need to stop the bleeding.

248
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,560
He's not gonna make it to the Kingdom.

249
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,700
Let's go!

250
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,110
Up!

251
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,650
Get in!

252
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,110
Stay with me. Stay with me.

253
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,500
I'm right here. Stay with me.

254
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,670
- All right. Okay. - It's okay.

255
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,490
It's okay.

256
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,590
"T-To injure an opponent...

257
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,590
is to injure yourself.

258
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,250
I'm sorry for coming to you.

259
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,250
We had no choice.

260
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,550
Morgan, wait.

261
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,260
Okay.

262
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,020
Oh, God.

263
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,870
Stay away from me.

264
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,950
Just listen.

265
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,990
No! No! Aah!

266
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,700
I know!

267
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,570
No! No! No!

268
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,930
I know!

269
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,750
Enough! No!

270
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,070
Benjamin, get your gun up.

271
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,980
It was supposed to be me.

272
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,660
That's what Gavin said --

273
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,840
that I'd be first.

274
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,820
I was trying to stop it.

275
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,410
I was gonna give my life to show you!

276
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,550
That's what should've happened today.

277
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,250
That's what I tried.

278
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,320
And something else happened

279
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,420
because we have done nothing to stop them.

280
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,990
We've done nothing!

281
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,910
Nothing.

282
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,360
I was in a camp when it started.

283
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,300
It was huge...endless...

284
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,640
a city of -- of tarps and latrines

285
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,840
and wood smoke and babies crying.

286
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,900
There were always babies crying.

287
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,170
I knew they had problems,

288
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,380
but I didn't think they were mine to solve.

289
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,770
I thought there were stronger or smarter people there than me.

290
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,220
W-Who the hell am I, right?

291
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,430
So I did nothing.

292
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,060
A-And there was a fight...

293
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,890
and a fire.

294
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,140
And I lost my wife.

295
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,910
And after three days of running,

296
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,030
no food, and no sleep...

297
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,050
of horror and terror...

298
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,250
I lost my little girl.

299
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,250
Right in front of me...

300
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,380
because I didn't do something.

301
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,090
Because I waited.

302
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,080
Listen to me.

303
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,220
Please.

304
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,130
Just listen.

305
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,410
We can use what's happened.

306
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,430
We can show the Saviors that we get it.

307
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,080
We understand what we need to do.

308
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,720
We know how to go on.

309
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,320
And they need to believe us.

310
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,290
We have to do something to make them believe us.

311
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,640
And then, when we gain their trust back...

312
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,730
we kill them...

313
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,750
end them.

314
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,740
We join with Alexandria and the Hilltop,

315
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,380
and we crush them in one fell swoop.

316
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,800
But this is it, Morgan.

317
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,140
You have...to...kill.

318
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,540
Or else you might as well just kill yourself.

319
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,990
Someone had to die.

320
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,660
I tried to be the one. That didn't happen.

321
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,660
So I'll be the one to lead our army

322
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,940
to crush the Saviors -- destroy them.

323
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,870
Me.

324
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,170
I'll talk to Ezekiel.

325
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,750
I'll tell everyone what I did.

326
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,560
And I'll live the rest of my life making up for it.

327
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,480
Did you tell him?

328
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,510
Did you?

329
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,380
Not now.

330
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,160
We'll talk about it when we get back.

331
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,200
What is it?

332
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,140
It's better to talk about it when we get back, Your Majesty.

333
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,410
We'll talk about it now.

334
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,520
How's the kid?

335
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,850
He's dead.

336
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,440
Start walking back now before I kill you.

337
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,300
You say one word or throw one look,

338
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,780
I'll kill you right here and now.

339
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,650
Go!

340
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,090
Do you have it?

341
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,320
I just want to say we get it.

342
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,930
We understand.

343
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,010
- Cease this! - Leave 'em be!

344
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,530
Morgan! Stop!

345
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,700
Morgan!

346
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,390
He set it all up.

347
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,880
He blocked the road yesterday, made us late.

348
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,280
It was all him.

349
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,680
And we had your offering when we left --

350
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,750
had it all.

351
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,770
He took one from the cargo, and he hid it --

352
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,160
when we stopped.

353
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,490
He wanted to get something started between the Kingdom and the Saviors.

354
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,900
Wanted to show you...

355
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,410
Wanted to show you that we get it...

356
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,720
That we understand what it is that we need to do --

357
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,460
that we know how to go on.

358
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,940
Good.

359
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,790
Next week, same time.

360
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,500
We -- We understand.

361
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,780
He -- He did this?

362
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,470
He wanted to die for us before.

363
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,130
He wanted it to be him.

364
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,440
Thought he could choose, and that's why Duane had to die.

365
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,660
"Duane"?

366
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,600
Benjamin -- Benjamin -- That's why Benjamin...

367
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,730
Morgan...

368
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,170
let us take our leave.

369
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,060
I was supposed to.

370
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,030
Morgan, you should not be alone here.

371
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,090
Go.

372
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,060
Not now.

373
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,420
- Benjamin not -- would not - ?Man, I said not now!

374
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,200
I said...

375
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,790
Y'all just go.

376
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,100
Do you really want to know what happened in Alexandria?

377
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,100
What happened to you?

378
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,240
Killed Richard.

379
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,460
I strangled him.

380
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,570
He's the one got Benjamin killed, so...

381
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,430
Do you want to know what happened in Alexandria?

382
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,020
Yeah.

383
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,040
Negan killed Glenn and Abraham.

384
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,510
What?

385
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,930
Beat them to death with a baseball bat.

386
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,370
Now the Saviors have Alexandria, and Rick and everybody else...

387
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,410
everything they do is for the Saviors now.

388
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,070
And they killed more.

389
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,510
Killed Spencer, Olivia...

390
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,430
Jesus brought Rick and the rest here because...

391
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,160
Rick wants to fight them.

392
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,220
You wanted to know.

393
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,050
Now you do.

394
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,620
- Where are you going? - I'm gonna kill them --

395
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,670
out there, one by one.

396
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,840
- But where? ? - Somewhere else.

397
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,910
W-Wait.

398
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,800
Wait. Just wait. Wait!

399
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,200
You can go...and not go.

400
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,390
Please.

401
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,750
Please.

402
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,280
Carol.

403
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,240
I'm sorry.

404
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,500
I thank you.

405
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,200
I'm gonna be here now.

406
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,020
We have to get ready.

407
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,760
We have to fight.

408
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,490
We do.

409
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,330
But not today.
