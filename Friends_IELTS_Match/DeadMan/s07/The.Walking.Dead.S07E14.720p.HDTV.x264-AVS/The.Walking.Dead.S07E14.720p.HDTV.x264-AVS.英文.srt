00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,550
I need a search party.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,130
See if Daryl ran home like the dumb animal that he is.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,590
Daryl does turn up here,

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,750
just know there's no statute of limitations on this.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,900
I'm utterly, completely, stone cold Negan.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,800
How many people here can fight?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,980
Who would train all this cannon fodder?

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,080
- I will. - Give me a week.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
I memorized everything

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,040
Daryl and Carl took Rick about the inside of Negan's place.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,970
- There's only two of us. - Are you changing your mind?

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,730
I'm ready to kill him.

Are you here --

24
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,130
I'm here because I need your help.

25
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,870
Sorry for taking over your trailer.

26
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,340
I grew up ?with a lot of people around.

27
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,630
I'm used to it.

28
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,950
Big family?

29
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Uh...group home.

30
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,930
This isn't like that, though.

31
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,300
Not the bad parts, at least.

32
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,360
For the first time, I feel like I belong.

33
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,440
Trying to make sure you and Sasha became a part of this

34
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,910
made me a part of this.

35
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,060
When I was first here...

36
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,090
I was never here.

37
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,780
I, um...

38
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,350
I always found it hard getting close to anyone --

39
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,770
neighbors, friends...

40
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,070
boyfriends.

41
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,430
You should try it sometime.

42
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,440
Even if it doesn't last.

43
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,060
I'm gonna talk to our blacksmith about making more spears.

44
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,400
Maybe we can trade with the Kingdom for some body armor.

45
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,570
Thing is, what we really need is riot gear.

46
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,860
I was...

47
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,880
looking for something to read the other day.

48
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,810
You can have the bullets.

49
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,260
I didn't know you had a gun.

50
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,440
I didn't.

51
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,990
I do now.

52
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,360
Sasha, don't go -- not yet.

53
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,410
Rosita didn't come here to train people.

54
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,580
You're both going after Negan.

55
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,860
But you can't do that without people.

56
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,180
A lot of people.

57
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,660
We've talked about this.

58
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,470
I know what you think.

59
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,440
And I appreciate that.

60
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,070
But I'm not gonna change my mind.

61
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,420
She's not.

62
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,360
Does Maggie know Rosita's here yet?

63
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,060
Uh, I-I-I don't think so.

64
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,800
I didn't...

65
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,630
You should tell her.

66
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,390
About all of it.

67
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,090
No. Not yet.

68
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,770
Sh--

69
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,710
I'm still -- I'm still getting ready.

70
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,270
And the thing is, Rosita is going,

71
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,560
with or without me.

72
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,870
So it should be with me.

73
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,310
- Then I'll go, too. - Me, too.

74
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,140
No.

75
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,410
The Hilltop has to be ready for what happens after.

76
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,850
Maggie needs you.

77
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,000
She needs you, too.

78
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,570
Not anymore.

79
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,100
She has everyone else,

80
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,960
and they have her.

81
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,940
You can stay.

82
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,080
I know you can.

83
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,980
But I know you won't and she won't,

84
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,130
but I wish you would.

85
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,080
'Cause it's a long life, and then it isn't.

86
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,810
You can take anything else you need.

87
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,620
But you and Rosita need to talk to Maggie.

88
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,340
You owe her that much.

89
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,050
Listen...

90
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,160
Enid...

91
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,200
Maggie trusts you.

92
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,310
You have to protect her, no matter what.

93
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,630
She's the future of this place.

94
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,970
I know it.

95
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,380
So are you.

96
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,610
Hold on to this for me.

97
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,770
It's for the baby.

98
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,780
Maybe you can work on it while I'm gone.

99
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,370
Okay.

100
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,170
Sasha...

101
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,300
Yeah.

102
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,580
In 10 minutes,

103
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,350
I'm gonna tell Maggie what's going on.

104
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,500
It's up to you what you want to do with that.

105
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,890
I'm doing what you asked.

106
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,450
The Saviors are coming!

107
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,210
The Saviors are coming!

108
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,950
We have to get Maggie.

109
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,160
- Where is she? ?- Come on!

110
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,000
Where do we hide?

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,890
We're not hiding.

112
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,900
All right, get in.

113
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,620
It goes to the other side.

114
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,110
We got to get out before Maggie does.

115
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,310
We'll never make it in time.

116
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:48,960
Come on!

117
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,390
Just stay down there.

118
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,410
I'll keep them away.

119
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,570
They aren't the same ones who came to Alexandria.

120
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,890
Simon! Hello.

121
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,200
Right back at you, Gregory.

122
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,180
Hello.

123
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,790
We weren't, uh, expecting you back so soon.

124
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,760
You want to talk in my office?

125
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,470
I got a bottle of gin my people found.

126
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,870
You're a gin man, right?

127
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,670
Oh, I'm a man of...

128
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,280
shifting specifics of tastes in transition.

129
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,260
I'm into tequila now.

130
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,080
A?ejo. Reposado.

131
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,610
Sipping, mixing...

132
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,120
Un mundo de sabor.

133
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,420
Gin seems like turpentine.

134
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,480
It happened quick with a gimlet the other night.

135
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm an unusual kind of creature.

136
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,630
You know what?

137
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,220
I respect that.

138
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,250
Yeah. Tequila.

139
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,150
Mental note. Locked.

140
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,300
Great.

141
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,480
Oh, no need to talk.

142
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
This is hopefully a quick visit.

143
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,260
Well, what can I do for you?

144
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,280
That's an excellent question.

145
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,880
Alas, the answer's not so excellent.

146
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,820
You have a certain somebody that, uh...

147
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,560
now needs to be Negan's certain somebody,

148
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,440
so what you can do for me is point me in their direction.

149
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,010
So, who is it?

150
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,150
You get your pointy finger up, and I'll tells ya.

151
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,560
Daryl.

152
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,900
Daryl.

153
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,620
Daryl.

154
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,300
Did you dig that tunnel?

155
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,690
Maggie thought we needed a quick way out.

156
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,060
So I made one.

157
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,550
Well, we're out. So now what?

158
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,980
You know.

159
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,670
If this one starts, I'll siphon some gas.

160
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,540
I just got to find --

161
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,950
There's an empty water bottle.

162
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,860
I thought this was the one, but...

163
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,100
Like it?

164
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,890
I made it.

165
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
Car's dead.

166
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,980
Where'd you learn to disarm bombs?

167
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,790
Were you in the Army?

168
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
Someone I knew.

169
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,480
Not him.

170
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,120
Listen, I'm not here to play "Get to Know You,"

171
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,210
so either we talk about the mission or we don't.

172
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,690
Okay.

173
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,740
Jesus said there's some buildings,

174
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,010
two, three, four stories,

175
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,220
just outside the sanctuary to the east of it.

176
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,290
At least one of them should have a line of sight to the rear courtyard,

177
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,970
past the fence with the walkers on it.

178
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,800
We hole up, we wait, we take a shot from there.

179
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,560
If we have to get closer,

180
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,960
there's some weak spots in the perimeter

181
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,450
we might still be able to take advantage of,

182
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,600
but if we can,

183
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,780
I say we stay outside, do it clean.

184
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,400
Maybe make it out of there alive.

185
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,210
You see a problem with that?

186
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,660
I want to make sure we get him.

187
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,580
That means we go in.

188
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,920
If we shoot from a distance and miss,

189
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
we don't get another chance.

190
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,760
I won't miss.

191
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,720
Even if you shoot and graze him, he doesn't die.

192
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,370
I won't miss.

193
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,100
If we go in and get caught --

194
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,310
I won't get caught.

195
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,690
What the hell's wrong with you?

196
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,380
They take us, we don't get another try.

197
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,440
Because they'll kill us.

198
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,020
If we're out here, we're alive.

199
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,280
We get another go.

200
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,570
Nothing is wrong with me, Sasha.

201
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,060
I'm gonna make sure he's dead.

202
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,570
Look, if this is too much for you,

203
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,440
you want to bail, now's your chance.

204
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm not going anywhere.

205
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,870
- Well, I'm done talking about it. - Good.

206
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,470
Maybe you'll think about it.

207
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,390
Maybe you'll change your mind

208
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,030
about what it takes to get what you want.

209
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,240
- I've got fresh veggies. - Stop.

210
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,930
They're vegetables.

211
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,350
Use the whole word.

212
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,550
We have time.

213
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,390
Okay.

214
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,630
I have these vegetables they told me to bring over,

215
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,450
and the basket's pretty heavy.

216
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,420
For me, I mean.

217
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,300
Probably not you. Uh, here.

218
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,210
Load them in the truck,

219
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,370
and, uh, if you meet me by the garden,

220
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,340
- I can get you the rest... - ?Stop.

221
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,530
I don't know who you think I am or who we are.

222
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,460
Load them yourself. I'm busy.

223
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,270
- Sorry. I'm sorry. - Girl,

224
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,700
pick that shit up right now and scram.

225
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,720
And I'll take that.

226
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Now.

227
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,050
Don't make me cut it off you, girl.

228
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,920
Dr. Harlan Carson, correct?

229
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,820
Do you need a checkup?

230
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,010
Probably. It's been a few years,

231
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,440
but I'm not here for that.

232
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,220
We already gave you as much medicine as we could spare

233
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,800
- the last time you were here. - ?Yes, you did.

234
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,260
But we're not here to take more of that.

235
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,380
Congratulations!

236
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,060
You're moving up in the world.

237
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,200
Negan wants you where he is.

238
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,300
You're an important fellow, Harlan.

239
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,580
You're coming with us.

240
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,340
Look, I -- I have patients here that need me.

241
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,250
Why does Negan need two doctors?

242
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,660
Well, I think my look may have conveyed the information.

243
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,620
People say I have an expressive face.

244
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,830
But if not, let me repeat your question.

245
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,410
Why do we need two doctors?

246
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,010
Answer - we don't.

247
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,080
So...

248
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,510
my brother pissed someone off, get himself killed?

249
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,720
Something like that.

250
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,600
Very, very ugly stuff.

251
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,160
My condolences.

252
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,630
But it's time.

253
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,400
All of my charts are in order.

254
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,090
You need to make arrangements for some kind of medical care here,

255
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,050
especially for my ongoing patients.

256
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,740
I will.

257
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,250
- I need to pack. - You don't.

258
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,060
We have everything you need,

259
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,710
and what we don't, we'll get.

260
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,720
Hey, you like ice cream?

261
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,770
We have ice cream.

262
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,480
We have a lady ?that makes cardamom gelato.

263
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,630
Shit you not.

264
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,340
Oh! Almost forgot. Set that down.

265
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,920
Well, fair is fair.

266
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,610
We're not leaving you high and dry

267
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,980
when it comes to medical solutions.

268
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,950
Go on.

269
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,720
Simon, a word?

270
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,590
Look,

271
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,870
I think I've proven that I can work with Negan.

272
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,100
I'm a can-do guy,

273
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,920
but I got to hang on to my peoples' trust.

274
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,170
Otherwise, you don't know who might take over.

275
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,890
You know, someone else might not be so cooperative.

276
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,730
They might have crazy ideas.

277
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,360
Who might take over?

278
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,110
- What crazy ideas? - I don't know.

279
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,920
I'm just considering worst-case scenarios.

280
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,300
You know, What I'm saying is,

281
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,870
I know human nature, and it isn't inconceivable.

282
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,870
I hear your concern.

283
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,590
I'm not insensitive to it. Mm. ?Right?

284
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,150
If you're having problems of that nature...

285
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,670
come to see me.

286
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,460
Anytime.

287
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,880
I don't know where to go.

288
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,030
I'll arrange it so that...

289
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,460
...you just tell the guard who you are...

290
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,490
...and he'll let you right in.

291
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,010
Long as ?there's no shenanigans afoot.

292
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,560
There will be none.

293
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,380
- I just -- I just would like you to consider -- - Wonderful.

294
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,480
We'll crack open some tequila.

295
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,840
We'll talk.

296
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,410
We'll work it out.

297
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,820
You're a good producer for us.

298
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,390
- I don't want you to be so stressed. - Yeah.

299
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,440
I'd be a lot less stressed if you'd leave my doctor.

300
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,450
Gregory...

301
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,450
Got it. Okay.

302
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,230
I won't ask again.

303
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,470
?You were gonna kill that guy.

304
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,220
He was gonna find us.

305
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,430
He wasn't, and he didn't.

306
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,770
He deserved to die.

307
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,520
Ever since you got here,

308
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,260
you haven't said a word to me.

309
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,270
Would you look at me?

310
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,030
Please?

311
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,890
Daryl...

312
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,860
I'm sorry.

313
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,850
I'm sorry.

314
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,250
It wasn't your fault.

315
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,650
It was.

316
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,670
No.

317
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,550
It wasn't.

318
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,790
You're one of the good things in this world.

319
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,660
That's what Glenn thought.

320
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,030
And he would know,

321
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,820
'cause he was ?one of the good things, too.

322
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,180
And, uh...

323
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,030
I wanted to kill that guy, too.

324
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,260
I wanted to string them all up and watch them die.

325
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,220
But we have to win.

326
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,740
Help me win.

327
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,930
This'll work.

328
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,750
Now.

329
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,950
?Get in!

330
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,440
?Anything?

331
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,350
Negan still hasn't come out.

332
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,110
But Eugene's out there.

333
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,710
Eugene?

334
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,360
It looks like...

335
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,570
he's ordering people around.

336
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,440
Playing some angle.

337
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,230
Will you teach me those knots?

338
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,950
I know a bunch, but not those.

339
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,880
Won't matter soon.

340
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,610
It might.

341
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,770
Yeah, I'll show you.

342
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,770
All right, here's the first one.

343
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,480
Cross it over your hand like that.

344
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,040
Then you take the top loop, bring it down, up,

345
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,620
and back through, then...

346
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,790
Got it?

347
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,310
Let me try.

348
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,270
You know...

349
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,690
we got lucky, having you with us.

350
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,200
You know how to do everything.

351
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,200
Johnny.

352
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,230
That's who taught me about bombs.

353
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,040
Survivalist, prepper-type shit.

354
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,980
Marcus taught me about cars.

355
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,490
He was a mechanic...

356
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,370
and a wannabe stunt driver.

357
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,420
And an asshole.

358
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,620
Knot-tying was from Chaser.

359
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,930
Yeah, that wasn't his real name.

360
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,140
There were others.

361
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,030
Were those people you lost on the way to D.C.?

362
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,440
No, not them.

363
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,050
A lot of guys wanted to protect me,

364
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,070
like there was no way i could know how to take care of myself.

365
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,620
And I didn't.

366
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,020
And I hated the way that felt.

367
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,430
So I rolled with it.

368
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,480
They didn't even notice I was picking up

369
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,610
everything they knew how to do and doing it better.

370
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,180
Then I'd outgrow them and bounce.

371
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,790
The sex was just for fun.

372
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,230
When the world's over,

373
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,580
everyone should be getting their rocks off.

374
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,020
Was that how it was with him?

375
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,590
Abraham?

376
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,250
No.

377
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,760
I fell in with him

378
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,580
because he saw I could handle my shit.

379
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,160
And I never looked back.

380
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,580
Well, no, I did.

381
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,380
When it was over.

382
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,200
Yeah.

383
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,960
You know the thing that killed me?

384
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,630
When we got to Alexandria,

385
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,800
I was acting like I was all good 'cause he wasn't.

386
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,920
Then, the son of a bitch was actually all good.

387
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,920
And I couldn't figure this one out.

388
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,430
Living there, feeling like we had made it,

389
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,930
I couldn't pick that up.

390
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,750
Then, when he bounced, I...

391
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,410
...I thought I hated you.

392
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,600
But maybe I just hated

393
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,250
that he figured out his shit first.

394
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,420
I've never told anyone any of that stuff.

395
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,640
Who I was, what I did...

396
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,370
I'm glad...

397
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,170
that you felt like...

398
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,100
you could.

399
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,070
I was stupid to waste so much time.

400
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,310
Now I'll never get to tell Abraham

401
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,960
I'm happy he was happy.

402
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,260
Were you happy?

403
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,860
I was.

404
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,950
It wasn't his time.

405
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,320
Abraham would've wanted to go out fighting.

406
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,460
And that asshole with the bat took that away, too.

407
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,210
To go out with a point to going out.

408
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,710
I guess we all want that.

409
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,180
No matter how it all goes down,

410
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,420
I got your back.

411
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,300
And I've got yours.

412
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,200
You think that prick's out there yet?

413
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,350
Oh...shit.

414
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,620
What?

415
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,570
Dr. Carson, Maggie's doctor.

416
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,770
They brought him here.

417
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,430
Negan's out.

418
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,090
Oh, he's too close.

419
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,960
Ah, I can't get a clean shot.

420
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,290
Turn on the walkie.

421
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,630
This is Dr. Eugene Porter, Chief Engineer, speaking.

422
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,200
I'm gonna need a dozen more walkers,

423
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,100
a.k.a. "dead ones" in the local parlance,

424
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,640
for expanding the fence protocol PDQ.

425
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,270
Actually, PFQ.

426
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,080
This is per Negan, who I also am,

427
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,300
even if it takes all night to procure them,

428
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,140
so I need able-bodied persons out there

429
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,470
in the surrounding blocks of buildings

430
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,200
snoopin' and snatchin', stat.

431
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,970
Negan will be indisposed in the boudoir,

432
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,540
so in the meantime,

433
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,240
any questions should be directed to yours truly.

434
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,340
Dr. Eugene Porter, Chief Engineer,

435
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,820
also known as Negan, who I am.

436
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,700
Change of plans.

437
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,500
So we go in.

438
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,440
I'm ready.

439
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,960
Come in.

440
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,950
Freddie said you wanted to see me?

441
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,620
Yes, have a seat.

442
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,870
I noticed you've been slacking on your scavenging

443
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,360
and recruiting lately.

444
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,970
And there are too many people in your trailer.

445
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,380
Fire hazard.

446
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,010
Plenty of room here at Barrington House for our guests.

447
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,250
Speaking of which,

448
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,280
I have job assignments for the newcomers.

449
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,100
People are gonna stay, they're gonna chip in.

450
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,130
No more free rides on the teat.

451
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,040
You let them take Dr. Carson.

452
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,050
Surprised you didn't kneel again.

453
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,960
You must be really worried

454
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,470
if you're trying to split everyone up.

455
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,660
Shouldn't talk to me like that.

456
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,660
Who knows what might happen

457
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,800
with all these Saviors coming around?

458
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,210
Did you just threaten me?

459
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,120
I was being sarcastic, okay?

460
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,930
No, I think you just threatened me.

461
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,250
Think what you want.

462
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,130
You know, what I'm saying is,

463
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,750
I look out for my friends,

464
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,880
and I realized... we're not friends.

465
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,820
?Come in.

466
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,410
Ah, wonderful -- tequila.

467
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,730
Crack that open for me, would you?

468
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,700
You may go now.

469
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,500
Show him out, will you, Kal?

470
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,810
Everything okay?

471
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,330
Where's Sasha and Rosita?

472
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,160
You see that over there?

473
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,280
That is a half-assed attempt at a safety protocol.

474
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,320
We need a full-assed, full-court press.

475
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,970
That stuff out front with the spikes and the chains and the heads,

476
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,030
that's good for the optics.

477
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,650
It sends a message to would-be intruders

478
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,680
of the "Don't Mess with Texas" Variety.

479
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,240
But we need to drill down on actual safety protocol,

480
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,640
especially at points that have proven to be janky.

481
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,930
Well, yeah.

482
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,290
That's why I'm on guard duty now.

483
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,530
No offense to that last guy,

484
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,410
but he could hardly handle a gun.

485
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,360
Get up. You're getting out.

486
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,630
Eugene, get up.

487
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,790
We're breaking you out.

488
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,320
Eugene!

489
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,510
No.

490
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,450
I'm not going with you.

491
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,250
What?

492
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,110
I didn't ask you to come, so go.

493
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,300
People got to be en route.

494
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,240
That weak, lying sack of shit.

495
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,530
This is it.

496
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,670
I'm going in.

497
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,450
Hold on.

498
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,930
This is gonna take a second.

499
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,970
More could be coming back.

500
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:11,960
Keep an eye out.

501
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,340
Just another second.

502
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,740
What the hell are you doing?

503
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,970
Go.

504
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,730
It's not your time.

505
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,440
There's got to be a point to it, right?

506
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,230
They need you.

507
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,780
Damn it.

508
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,520
Damn it!
