You have to protect her, no matter what.

104
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,630
她是这里的未来
She's the future of this place.

105
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,970
我知道
I know it.

106
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,380
你也是
So are you.

107
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,610
帮我保管
Hold on to this for me.

108
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,770
这是给孩子的
It's for the baby.

109
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,780
也许我走后你能继续编
Maybe you can work on it while I'm gone.

110
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,370
好
Okay.

111
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,170
萨沙
Sasha...

112
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,300
嗯
Yeah.

113
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,580
十分钟后
In 10 minutes,

114
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,350
我会告诉玛姬发生了什么
I'm gonna tell Maggie what's going on.

115
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,500
在此期间  你想怎么做是你的事
It's up to you what you want to do with that.

116
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,890
我照你的吩咐做了
I'm doing what you asked.

117
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,450
救世军来了
The Saviors are coming!

118
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,210
救世军来了
The Saviors are coming!

119
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,950
我们得去找玛姬
We have to get Maggie.

120
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,160
-她在哪  -快来
- Where is she? ?- Come on!

121
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,000
我们躲在哪
Where do we hide?

122
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,890
我们不躲
We're not hiding.

123
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,900
好  进来
All right, get in.

124
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,620
这通往另一头
It goes to the other side.

125
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,110
我们得赶在玛姬之前出去
We got to get out before Maggie does.

126
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,310
我们来不及的
We'll never make it in time.

127
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:48,960
快
Come on!

128
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,390
待在下面
Just stay down there.

129
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,410
我来引开他们
I'll keep them away.

130
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,570
这不是去亚历山大的那批人
They aren't the same ones who came to Alexandria.

131
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,890
西蒙  你好啊
Simon! Hello.

132
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,200
你也好啊  格雷戈里
Right back at you, Gregory.

133
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,180
你好
Hello.

134
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,790
我们没料到你这么快就回来了
We weren't, uh, expecting you back so soon.

135
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,760
想去我办公室谈吗
You want to talk in my office?

136
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,470
我的人找到了一瓶琴酒
I got a bottle of gin my people found.

137
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,870
你喜欢喝琴酒  对吧
You're a gin man, right?

138
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,670
我的
Oh, I'm a man of...

139
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,280
口味经常变化
shifting specifics of tastes in transition.

140
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,260
我现在喜欢龙舌兰了
I'm into tequila now.

141
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,080
陈酿  金黄色
A?ejo. Reposado.

142
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,610
啜饮  混合
Sipping, mixing...

143
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,120
口味的世界
Un mundo de sabor.

144
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,420
琴酒像是松节油
Gin seems like turpentine.

145
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,480
那晚喝了琴蕾鸡尾酒  口味就变了
It happened quick with a gimlet the other night.

146
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,000
我是个非同寻常的人
I'm an unusual kind of creature.

147
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,630
知道吗
You know what?

148
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,220
我尊重这点
I respect that.

149
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,250
嗯  龙舌兰
Yeah. Tequila.

150
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,150
心理笔记  记住了
Mental note. Locked.

151
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,300
很好
Great.

152
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,480
没必要闲聊了
Oh, no need to talk.

153
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,800
这是一次短暂的拜访
This is hopefully a quick visit.

154
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,260
我能为你做什么
Well, what can I do for you?

155
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,280
问得好
That's an excellent question.

156
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,880
但是啊  答案可就没那么好了
Alas, the answer's not so excellent.

157
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,820
你这里的某个人...
You have a certain somebody that, uh...

158
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,560
现在要变成尼根的人
now needs to be Negan's certain somebody,

159
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,440
所以你能为我做的就是指明他所在的方向
so what you can do for me is point me in their direction.

160
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,010
你指的是谁
So, who is it?

161
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,150
你准备好带路  我就告诉你
You get your pointy finger up, and I'll tells ya.

162
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,560
达里尔
Daryl.

163
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,900
达里尔
Daryl.

164
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,620
达里尔
Daryl.

165
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,300
那个隧道是你挖的吗
Did you dig that tunnel?

166
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,690
玛姬认为我们得有个出去的捷径
Maggie thought we needed a quick way out.

167
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,060
所以我就挖了一条
So I made one.

168
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,550
我们出来了  现在怎么办
Well, we're out. So now what?

169
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,980
你知道的
You know.

170
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,670
假如这辆能点着  我会抽走一些油
If this one starts, I'll siphon some gas.

171
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,540
我只要找到...
I just got to find --

172
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,950
那里有个空水瓶
There's an empty water bottle.

173
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,860
我以为这辆能点着  但是...
I thought this was the one, but...

174
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,100
喜欢吗
Like it?

175
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,890
我做的
I made it.

176
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
这车点不着
Car's dead.

177
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,980
你在哪儿学的拆弹
Where'd you learn to disarm bombs?

178
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,790
你之前是军队的吗
Were you in the Army?

179
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
我认识的一个人教我的
Someone I knew.

180
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,480
不是他
Not him.

181
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,120
听着  我不是来玩"相互了解"的
Listen, I'm not here to play "Get to Know You,"

182
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,210
所以我们要么谈任务  要么不说话
so either we talk about the mission or we don't.

183
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,690
好吧
Okay.

184
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,740
耶稣说有几栋建筑
Jesus said there's some buildings,

185
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,010
二三四层楼高
two, three, four stories,

186
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,220
就在救世堂外的东边
just outside the sanctuary to the east of it.

187
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,290
那些建筑中至少有一栋能看到他们的后院
At least one of them should have a line of sight to the rear courtyard,

188
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,970
就在行尸围栏后面
past the fence with the walkers on it.

189
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,800
我们躲起来  等着  然后从那里狙击
We hole up, we wait, we take a shot from there.

190
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,560
如果我们不得不靠近
If we have to get closer,

191
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,960
外围有一些薄弱点
there's some weak spots in the perimeter

192
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,450
或许我们可以利用
we might still be able to take advantage of,

193
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,600
但假如可以的话
but if we can,

194
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,780
我还是建议我们待在外面  做得干净些
I say we stay outside, do it clean.

195
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,400
也许还能活着回来
Maybe make it out of there alive.

196
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,210
你有意见吗
You see a problem with that?

197
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,660
我想确保我们杀了他
I want to make sure we get him.

198
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,580
那就意味着我们得进去
That means we go in.

199
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,920
假如我们在远处射偏了
If we shoot from a distance and miss,

200
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
就没有第二次机会了
we don't get another chance.

201
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,760
我不会射偏的
I won't miss.

202
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,720
就算你射伤了他  他也死不了
Even if you shoot and graze him, he doesn't die.

203
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,370
我不会射偏的
I won't miss.

204
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,100
假如我们进去被抓住了...
If we go in and get caught --

205
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,310
我不会被抓住的
I won't get caught.

206
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,690
你到底有什么毛病
What the hell's wrong with you?

207
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,380
被抓住就没第二次机会了
They take us, we don't get another try.

208
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,440
因为他们会杀了我们
Because they'll kill us.

209
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,020
如果我们待在外面  还能活命
If we're out here, we're alive.

210
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,280
还有第二次机会
We get another go.

211
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,570
我没什么毛病  萨沙
Nothing is wrong with me, Sasha.

212
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,060
我要确保杀死他
I'm gonna make sure he's dead.

213
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,570
假如这对你而言太过了
Look, if this is too much for you,

214
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,440
你想要退出  现在可以走
you want to bail, now's your chance.

215
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,750
我哪里也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

216
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,870
-我已经受够谈论这个了  -很好
- Well, I'm done talking about it. - Good.

217
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,470
也许你会考虑一下
Maybe you'll think about it.

218
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,390
也许你会重新想想
Maybe you'll change your mind

219
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,030
该以什么代价达成目标
about what it takes to get what you want.

220
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,240
-我这有鲜菜  -停
- I've got fresh veggies. - Stop.

221
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,930
它们是蔬菜
They're vegetables.

222
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,350
用全称
Use the whole word.

223
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,550
我们有的是时间
We have time.

224
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,390
好吧
Okay.

225
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,630
我有蔬菜  他们让我拿过来
I have these vegetables they told me to bring over,

226
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,450
而且  篮子很重
and the basket's pretty heavy.

227
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,420
对我来说很重
For me, I mean.

228
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,300
对你可能不重  拿着
Probably not you. Uh, here.

229
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,210
装到卡车上去
Load them in the truck,

230
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,370
如果你来菜园那边找我
and, uh, if you meet me by the garden,

231
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,340
-我可以把剩下的...  -停
- I can get you the rest... - ?Stop.

232
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,530
我不知道你以为我或我们是什么人
I don't know who you think I am or who we are.

233
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,460
自己装车  我很忙
Load them yourself. I'm busy.

234
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,270
-抱歉  很抱歉  -姑娘
- Sorry. I'm sorry. - Girl,

235
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,700
赶紧捡起来  然后滚开
pick that shit up right now and scram.

236
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,720
这个我收了
And I'll take that.

237
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
快点
Now.

238
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,050
别逼我弄死你  姑娘
Don't make me cut it off you, girl.

239
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,920
哈兰・卡森医生吗
Dr. Harlan Carson, correct?

240
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,820
你需要检查吗
Do you need a checkup?

241
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,010
也许吧  好几年没查过了
Probably. It's been a few years,

242
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,440
但我不是为这个来的
but I'm not here for that.

243
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,220
上次你们来的时候  我们已经把
We already gave you as much medicine as we could spare

244
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,800
-能交的药都交出来了  -没错
- the last time you were here. - ?Yes, you did.

245
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,260
但我们不是来要药的
But we're not here to take more of that.

246
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,380
祝贺你
Congratulations!

247
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,060
你升职了
You're moving up in the world.

248
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,200
尼根要你住过去
Negan wants you where he is.

249
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,300
你是个重要人物  哈兰
You're an important fellow, Harlan.

250
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,580
跟我们走
You're coming with us.

251
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,340
听着  这里有病人需要我
Look, I -- I have patients here that need me.

252
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,250
尼根为什么要两个医生
Why does Negan need two doctors?

253
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,660
我想我的表情已经传达了信息
Well, I think my look may have conveyed the information.

254
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,620
大家都说我的脸很传神
People say I have an expressive face.

255
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,830
但如果不够传神  我来重复你的问题  
But if not, let me repeat your question.

256
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,410
我们为什么要两个医生
Why do we need two doctors?

257
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,010
回答是  不需要两个
Answer - we don't.

258
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,080
所以
So...

259
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,510
我哥哥惹恼了什么人  所以被杀了吗
my brother pissed someone off, get himself killed?

260
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,720
差不多吧
Something like that.

261
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,600
非常残忍可怖
Very, very ugly stuff.

262
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,160
节哀顺变
My condolences.

263
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,630
但是  该走了
But it's time.

264
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,400
我的病历都是整理好的
All of my charts are in order.

265
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,090
你得对这里的医疗方案做一些安排
You need to make arrangements for some kind of medical care here,

266
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,050
特别是我的长期病患
especially for my ongoing patients.

267
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,740
我会的
I will.

268
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,250
-我得收拾行李  -不用了
- I need to pack. - You don't.

269
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,060
你要的东西我们都有
We have everything you need,

270
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,710
没有的我们也会弄来
and what we don't, we'll get.

271
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,720
你喜欢冰淇淋吗
Hey, you like ice cream?

272
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,770
我们有冰淇淋
We have ice cream.

273
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,480
我们有位女士会做小豆蔻冰淇淋
We have a lady ?that makes cardamom gelato.

274
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,630
不骗你
Shit you not.

275
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,340
差点忘了  把那个放下
Oh! Almost forgot. Set that down.

276
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,920
要公平合理
Well, fair is fair.

277
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,610
涉及到医疗方案
We're not leaving you high and dry

278
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,980
我们可不会让你们孤立无援
when it comes to medical solutions.

279
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,950
去看看吧
Go on.

280
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,490
阿司匹林

281
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,720
西蒙  能和你谈谈吗
Simon, a word?

282
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,590
听着
Look,

283
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,870
我觉得我已经证明了我能和尼根合作
I think I've proven that I can work with Negan.

284
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,100
我能做到
I'm a can-do guy,

285
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,920
但我需要我的人信任我
but I got to hang on to my peoples' trust.

286
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,170
不然  你不知道谁会取代我
Otherwise, you don't know who might take over.

287
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,890
其他人可能不怎么想合作
You know, someone else might not be so cooperative.

288
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,730
他们可能有很疯狂的想法
They might have crazy ideas.

289
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,360
谁会取代你
Who might take over?

290
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,110
-什么疯狂的想法  -我不知道
- What crazy ideas? - I don't know.

291
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,920
我只是在考虑最坏的情况
I'm just considering worst-case scenarios.

292
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,300
我想说的是
You know, What I'm saying is,

293
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,870
我了解人性  不难揣测
I know human nature, and it isn't inconceivable.

294
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,870
我明白你的担忧
I hear your concern.

295
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,590
我也不是不知道  对吧
I'm not insensitive to it. Mm. ?Right?

296
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,150
如果你担心那种问题...
If you're having problems of that nature...

297
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,670
就来找我
come to see me.

298
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,460
随时都可以
Anytime.

299
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,880
我不知道去哪里找你
I don't know where to go.

300
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,030
我会安排的...
I'll arrange it so that...

301
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,460
你只要告诉守卫你是谁...
...you just tell the guard who you are...

302
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,490
他就会放你进来
...and he'll let you right in.

303
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,010
只要你别耍什么花招
Long as ?there's no shenanigans afoot.

304
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,560
没有花招
There will be none.

305
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,380
-我只是想让你考虑一下  -很好
- I just -- I just would like you to consider -- - Wonderful.

306
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,480
我们会开几瓶龙舌兰
We'll crack open some tequila.

307
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,840
我们会聊聊
We'll talk.

308
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,410
我们会解决的
We'll work it out.

309
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,820
你是一名优秀的生产者
You're a good producer for us.

310
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,390
-我不想你压力太大  -好吧
- I don't want you to be so stressed. - Yeah.

311
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,440
如果你能放了我的医生  我压力会小很多
I'd be a lot less stressed if you'd leave my doctor.

312
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,450
格雷戈里
Gregory...

313
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,450
明白了  没问题
Got it. Okay.

314
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,230
我不会再要求了
I won't ask again.

315
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,470
你打算杀了那人
?You were gonna kill that guy.

316
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,220
他会发现我们
He was gonna find us.

317
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,430
他不会  他也没找到
He wasn't, and he didn't.

318
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,770
他该死
He deserved to die.

319
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,520
你来到这里以后
Ever since you got here,

320
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,260
你还没和我说过一句话
you haven't said a word to me.

321
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,270
你能看着我吗
Would you look at me?

322
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,030
求你了
Please?

323
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,890
达里尔
Daryl...

324
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,860
对不起
I'm sorry.

325
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,850
对不起
I'm sorry.

326
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,250
那不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

327
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,650
是我的错
It was.

328
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,670
不
No.

329
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,550
不是的
It wasn't.

330
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,790
你是这世上仅存的善与美好
You're one of the good things in this world.

331
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,660
格伦一直是这么想的
That's what Glenn thought.

332
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,030
他肯定不会错
And he would know,

333
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,820
因为他也是这世上仅存的善与美好
'cause he was ?one of the good things, too.

334
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,180
而且...
And, uh...

335
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,030
我也想杀了那人
I wanted to kill that guy, too.

336
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,260
我想把他们都绑起来  看着他们死去
I wanted to string them all up and watch them die.

337
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,220
但我们必须要赢
But we have to win.

338
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,740
帮我赢
Help me win.

339
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,930
没问题的
This'll work.

340
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,750
现在
Now.

341
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,950
上车
?Get in!

342
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,440
有情况吗
?Anything?

343
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,350
尼根还是没出来
Negan still hasn't come out.

344
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,110
不过尤金在外面
But Eugene's out there.

345
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,710
尤金
Eugene?

346
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,360
看起来
It looks like...

347
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,570
他似乎在指挥别人
he's ordering people around.

348
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,440
有他自己的打算吧
Playing some angle.

349
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,230
能教教我怎么系这种绳结吗
Will you teach me those knots?

350
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,950
我知道很多种  但没见过这种
I know a bunch, but not those.

351
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,880
很快  这些都不重要了
Won't matter soon.

352
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,610
或许重要呢
It might.

353
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,770
好吧  我教你
Yeah, I'll show you.

354
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,770
首先是第一个
All right, here's the first one.

355
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,480
像这样在你手里交叉
Cross it over your hand like that.

356
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,040
然后把上面这一圈拉下来  折上去
Then you take the top loop, bring it down, up,

357
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,620
从后面穿过来  然后这样
and back through, then...

358
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,790
会了吗
Got it?

359
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,310
我试试
Let me try.

360
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,270
你知道吗
You know...

361
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,690
我们很幸运有你跟我们在一起
we got lucky, having you with us.

362
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,200
你什么都知道
You know how to do everything.

363
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,200
约翰尼
Johnny.

364
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,230
我关于炸弹的知识都是他教的
That's who taught me about bombs.

365
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,040
他是个生存主义者  "有备族"什么的
Survivalist, prepper-type shit.

366
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,980
关于车的知识是马库斯教的
Marcus taught me about cars.

367
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,490
他是个技工
He was a mechanic...

368
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,370
一心想做个特技车手
and a wannabe stunt driver.

369
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,420
混球一个
And an asshole.

370
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,620
绳结是猎人教的
Knot-tying was from Chaser.

371
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,930
当然  他真名不叫这个
Yeah, that wasn't his real name.

372
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,140
还有其他一些人
There were others.

373
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,030
是你去华盛顿的路上失去的那些伙伴吗
Were those people you lost on the way to D.C.?

374
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,440
不  不是他们
No, not them.

375
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,050
有很多人想要保护我
A lot of guys wanted to protect me,

376
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,070
就好像我自己完全保护不了自己一样
like there was no way i could know how to take care of myself.

377
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,620
我当时确实保护不了
And I didn't.

378
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,020
我讨厌那种感觉
And I hated the way that felt.

379
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,430
所以我顺着他们来
So I rolled with it.

380
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,480
他们甚至都没有注意到
They didn't even notice I was picking up

381
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,610
我把他们的东西都学会了  还比他们做得更好
everything they knew how to do and doing it better.

382
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,180
我比他们强了就离开了
Then I'd outgrow them and bounce.

383
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,790
做爱只是觉得好玩
The sex was just for fun.

384
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,230
世界都玩完了
When the world's over,

385
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,580
大家都该随心所欲些
everyone should be getting their rocks off.

386
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,020
你跟他也只是这样吗
Was that how it was with him?

387
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,590
亚伯拉罕
Abraham?

388
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,250
不是
No.

389
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,760
我爱上他了
I fell in with him

390
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,580
因为他看到了我能保护好自己
because he saw I could handle my shit.

391
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,160
我以前从不回头
And I never looked back.

392
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,580
不  我回头了
Well, no, I did.

393
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,380
在我们分手时
When it was over.

394
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,200
是啊
Yeah.

395
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,960
你知道我最受不了的是什么吗
You know the thing that killed me?

396
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,630
我们到亚历山大以后
When we got to Alexandria,

397
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,800
我表现得像完全没事一样  而他不是
I was acting like I was all good 'cause he wasn't.

398
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,920
然后  那个混蛋倒是真的完全没事了
Then, the son of a bitch was actually all good.

399
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,920
我就是想不明白
And I couldn't figure this one out.

400
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,430
在那里生活着  好像我们已经成功了
Living there, feeling like we had made it,

401
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,930
我就是适应不了
I couldn't pick that up.

402
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,750
然后  当他离开  我...
Then, when he bounced, I...

403
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,410
我以为我恨你
...I thought I hated you.

404
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,600
但也许我恨的只是
But maybe I just hated

405
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,250
他先搞明白了自己的破事
that he figured out his shit first.

406
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,420
我从来没和任何人说过这些
I've never told anyone any of that stuff.

407
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,640
我曾是谁  我做过什么
Who I was, what I did...

408
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,370
我很高兴
I'm glad...

409
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,170
你觉得你可以
that you felt like...

410
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,100
跟我说
you could.

411
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,070
我太蠢了  浪费了那么多时间
I was stupid to waste so much time.

412
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,310
现在我再也没有机会告诉亚伯拉罕
Now I'll never get to tell Abraham

413
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,960
他快乐令我也感到快乐
I'm happy he was happy.

414
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,260
你当时快乐吗
Were you happy?

415
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,860
快乐
I was.

416
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,950
他命不该绝
It wasn't his time.

417
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,320
亚伯拉罕会想在抗争中死去
Abraham would've wanted to go out fighting.

418
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,460
那个拿球棒的混球连这个机会都不给
And that asshole with the bat took that away, too.

419
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,210
死的要有意义
To go out with a point to going out.

420
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,710
我猜这是我们所有人都想要的
I guess we all want that.

421
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,180
无论最后变成什么样
No matter how it all goes down,

422
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,420
我是你的后盾
I got your back.

423
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,300
我也是你的后盾
And I've got yours.

424
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,200
你觉得那个混球出来了吗
You think that prick's out there yet?

425
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,350
该死
Oh...shit.

426
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,620
怎么了
What?

427
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,570
卡森医生  玛姬的医生
Dr. Carson, Maggie's doctor.

428
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,770
他们把他带来了
They brought him here.

429
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,430
尼根出来了
Negan's out.

430
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,090
他离得太近了
Oh, he's too close.

431
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,960
我瞄不到他
Ah, I can't get a clean shot.

432
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,290
打开对讲机
Turn on the walkie.

433
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,630
我是尤金・伯特博士  首席工程师  
This is Dr. Eugene Porter, Chief Engineer, speaking.

434
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,200
我还需要一打行尸
I'm gonna need a dozen more walkers,

435
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,100
按本地说法  也就是死尸
a.k.a. "dead ones" in the local parlance,

436
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,640
用来扩展围栏方案  立刻去做
for expanding the fence protocol PDQ.

437
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,270
立刻他妈去做
Actually, PFQ.

438
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,080
这是尼根的要求  我也是尼根
This is per Negan, who I also am,

439
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,300
即便抓它们要一晚上时间
even if it takes all night to procure them,

440
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,140
所以我需要派体格健全的人出去
so I need able-bodied persons out there

441
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,470
在附近街区搜寻抓获
in the surrounding blocks of buildings

442
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,200
立马出发
snoopin' and snatchin', stat.

443
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,970
尼根会在后宫歇息  不宜见客
Negan will be indisposed in the boudoir,

444
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,540
所以在此期间
so in the meantime,

445
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,240
一切问题都直接向我汇报
any questions should be directed to yours truly.

446
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,340
尤金・伯特博士  首席工程师
Dr. Eugene Porter, Chief Engineer,

447
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,820
又名尼根  也就是我
also known as Negan, who I am.

448
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,700
计划改变
Change of plans.

449
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,500
我们进去
So we go in.

450
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,440
我准备好了
I'm ready.

451
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,960
进来
Come in.

452
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,950
弗莱迪说你找我
Freddie said you wanted to see me?

453
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,620
是的  坐吧
Yes, have a seat.

454
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,870
我发现你最近搜索补给和招募新人
I noticed you've been slacking on your scavenging

455
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,360
都很不用心
and recruiting lately.

456
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,970
而且你拖车里的人太多了
And there are too many people in your trailer.

457
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,380
火灾隐患
Fire hazard.

458
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,010
巴林顿公馆还有很多空房可供客人居住
Plenty of room here at Barrington House for our guests.

459
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,250
说到这个
Speaking of which,

460
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,280
我给新人们安排了工作
I have job assignments for the newcomers.

461
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,100
他们想留下来  就得分担工作
People are gonna stay, they're gonna chip in.

462
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,130
别再想搭便车了
No more free rides on the teat.

463
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,040
你任他们带走了卡森医生
You let them take Dr. Carson.

464
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,050
很惊讶你这次没下跪
Surprised you didn't kneel again.

465
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,960
这么急着分开大家
You must be really worried

466
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,470
看来你一定很担心
if you're trying to split everyone up.

467
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,660
你不该用那种口气跟我说话
Shouldn't talk to me like that.

468
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,660
谁知道救世军
Who knows what might happen

469
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,800
来的时候会发生什么呢
with all these Saviors coming around?

470
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,210
你刚是在威胁我吗
Did you just threaten me?

471
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,120
我只是在讽刺  好吗
I was being sarcastic, okay?

472
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,930
不  我觉得你刚是在威胁我
No, I think you just threatened me.

473
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,250
随你怎么想
Think what you want.

474
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,130
我只是想说
You know, what I'm saying is,

475
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,750
我会关照朋友
I look out for my friends,

476
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,880
而我意识到  我们不是朋友
and I realized... we're not friends.

477
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,820
进
?Come in.

478
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,410
非常好  龙舌兰
Ah, wonderful -- tequila.

479
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,730
给我打开  好吗
Crack that open for me, would you?

480
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,700
你可以出去了
You may go now.

481
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,500
带他出去  凯尔
Show him out, will you, Kal?

482
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,810
没出什么事吧
Everything okay?

483
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,330
萨沙和罗西塔在哪
Where's Sasha and Rosita?

484
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,160
看到那个了吗
You see that over there?

485
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,280
那是个半瓶子晃荡的安全措施
That is a half-assed attempt at a safety protocol.

486
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,320
我们要周密  全面的防守
We need a full-assed, full-court press.

487
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,970
前面的那些尖矛  铁链  头颅
That stuff out front with the spikes and the chains and the heads,

488
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,030
视觉效果很好
that's good for the optics.

489
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,650
给潜在的入侵者释放了
It sends a message to would-be intruders

490
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,680
"别惹老子"的信息
of the "Don't Mess with Texas" Variety.

491
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,240
但我们要深入探讨一下真正的安全措施
But we need to drill down on actual safety protocol,

492
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,640
尤其是那些已被证明的薄弱点
especially at points that have proven to be janky.

493
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,930
好
Well, yeah.

494
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,290
所以才换我来值守
That's why I'm on guard duty now.

495
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,530
无意冒犯前一个人
No offense to that last guy,

496
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,410
但他连枪都拿不稳
but he could hardly handle a gun.

497
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,360
起来  你要出去了
Get up. You're getting out.

498
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,630
尤金  起来
Eugene, get up.

499
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,790
我们救你出去
We're breaking you out.

500
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,320
尤金
Eugene!

501
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,510
不
No.

502
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,450
我不跟你们走
I'm not going with you.

503
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,250
什么
What?

504
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,110
我没让你们来  所以走吧
I didn't ask you to come, so go.

505
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,300
肯定有人来了
People got to be en route.

506
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,240
懦弱  骗人的混蛋
That weak, lying sack of shit.

507
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,530
就现在
This is it.

508
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:04,670
我进了
I'm going in.

509
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,450
等等
Hold on.

510
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,930
这得花点时间
This is gonna take a second.

511
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,970
可能有更多人来
More could be coming back.

512
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:11,960
注意周围
Keep an eye out.

513
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,340
马上就好
Just another second.

514
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,740
你在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

515
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,970
走吧
Go.

516
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,730
你命不该绝
It's not your time.

517
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,440
必须有所意义  对吗
There's got to be a point to it, right?

518
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,230
他们需要你
They need you.

519
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,780
该死
Damn it.

520
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,520
该死
Damn it!
