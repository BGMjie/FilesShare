Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead..."

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,730
You told us to get ready to fight

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,070
and I can now.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,300
Maggie said that her people could take care of the Saviors.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,490
But so far all they've done is put our community at risk.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,140
I'm asking you to help convince Ezekiel to attack the Saviors

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,650
and destroy them.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,700
We'll win,

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,510
we need to wait for the right moment.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,620

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,530
No! No way in hell.

22
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,110
That was not the deal.

23
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,670
You people swore you could take the Saviors out,

24
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,850
and you failed.

25
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,050
So any arrangement we had is now done --

26
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,140
null and void.

27
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,470
We aren't trade partners, we aren't friends,

28
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,300
and we never met.

29
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,200
Hmm?

30
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,750
We don't know each other.

31
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,320
I owe you nothing.

32
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,450
In fact, you owe me for taking in the refugees,

33
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,910
at great personal risk.

34
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,580
Oh, you were very brave staying in here

35
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,770
while Maggie and Sasha saved this place.

36
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,530
Your courage was inspiring.

37
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,480
Hey, don't you work for me?

38
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,660
Aren't we friends?

39
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,360
Gregory, we already started this.

40
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,200
- You started it. - We did.

41
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,590
And we're gonna win.

42
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,820
These are killers.

43
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,340
Is this how you want to live?

44
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,920
Under their thumb, killing your people?

45
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,370
S-Sometimes we don't get to choose

46
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,980
what our life looks like.

47
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:11,900
Sometimes, Ricky,

48
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,810
you have to count the blessings you have.

49
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,900
How many people can we spare?

50
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,370
How many people here can fight?

51
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,250
"We"?

52
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,050
I don't even know how many people we have, Margaret.

53
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,580
And does it even matter?

54
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,550
I mean...

55
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,310
...w-w-what are you gonna do?

56
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,170
Start a platoon of sorghum farmers?

57
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,550
'Cause that's what we got.

58
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,480
They grow things. They're not gonna want to fight.

59
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,580
You're wrong.

60
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,080
When people have the chance to do the right thing,

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,910
they usually step up.

62
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,870
- I mean, people just -- - L-Let me stop you

63
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,330
before you break into song, okay?

64
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,730
And, by the way,

65
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,030
who would train all this cannon fodder?

66
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,340
- I will. - Give me a week.

67
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,770
Rhetorical, okay?

68
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,050
I don't want to know.

69
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,190
I never want to hear another word about any of it, ever.

70
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,210
Would we be better off without the Saviors,

71
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,660
- yes or no? - Yeah. Sure. Okay.

72
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,120
So, what will you do to fix the problem?

73
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,150
I didn't say we had a problem.

74
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,090
You did.

75
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,910
And what happens outside of my purview

76
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,880
is outside of my purview.

77
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,480
What the hell, man?

78
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,520
You're either with us or you ain't.

79
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,920
You're sitting over there talking out of both sides of your mouth.

80
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,980
I -- I think I've made my position very clear.

81
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,520
And I want to thank all of you for not being here today

82
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,430
and not having this meeting with me

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,720
or -- or being seen on your way out.

84
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,990
In other words, go out the back.

85
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,620
- Walking ballsack. - ?Wanna knock that idiot's teeth out.

86
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,460
Yeah, well, we don't need him anyway.

87
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,970
Yeah, that's right.

88
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,860
'Cause we have Maggie and Sasha and Jesus here.

89
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,900
And...

90
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,280
Enid.

91
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,510
- Hey, um -- - What's wrong?

92
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,340
Nothing.

93
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,740
Just...

94
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,650
Come outside.

95
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,280
What's going on?

96
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,930
So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.

97
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,910
And I owe my life to you all, twice over.

98
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,120
A bunch of us do.

99
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,950
Enid says that you want Gregory

100
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,810
to get us to fight the Saviors with you.

101
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,770
Is that true?

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,750
- Yes. ?- Do you think we can win,

103
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,670
that we really could beat them?

104
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,440
Us?

105
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,630
I do.

106
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,940
Well, Enid says you could show us the way.

107
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,450
- I'm ready. - Me too.

108
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,140
-Yeah. -Let's do this.

109
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,340
- Let's do it. - I'm in.

110
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,950
- It's a start. - We'll get more.

111
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,300
- It still won't be enough. - No, it won't.

112
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,350
Well, we find the right stuff,

113
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,660
then maybe we don't need the numbers.

114
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,510
Blow 'em up, burn 'em to the ground.

115
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,880
You said there weren't just soldiers with the Saviors,

116
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,190
that there were workers there.

117
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,930
People didn't have a choice.

118
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,290
We gotta win.

119
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,930
We need more hands, another group.

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,010
Negan has outposts.

121
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,680
The geography, the distance works against us.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,090
We gotta get back.

123
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,750
If they come looking for Daryl, we need to be there.

124
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,970
You don't have to get back.

125
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,670
Not yet.

126
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,640
It's one of theirs, long range.

127
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,530
We can listen in, keep track of them.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,470
So, if we're not going back, what are we doing, then?

129
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,810
I think it's time we introduced you to Ezekiel.

130
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,180
King Ezekiel.

131
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,870
King?

132
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,660
It's called "The Kingdom"?

133
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,010
Yeah.

134
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,680
I didn't name it.

135
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,910
How much farther?

136
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,670
Well, technically, we're already here.

137
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,660
I mean, we're always here,

138
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,420
but here we are -- at the Kingdom.

139
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,130
Well, its outer edge.

140
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,260
Hey, what the hell we waitin' on?

141
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,980
Waiting for them.

142
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,460
Who dares to trespass on the sovereign land of the --

143
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,360
Oh, shit.

144
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,300
Jesus, is that you?

145
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,140
Who are all these people, Paul?

146
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,620
Hi, Richard.

147
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,650
Nice to see you.

148
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,880
It's good to see you, too.

149
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,740
Your friends, who are they?

150
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,340
This is Rick Grimes.

151
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,380
He's the leader of a like-minded community.

152
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,500
These are some of his people.

153
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,130
We would like to request an audience with King Ezekiel.

154
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,910
Get out of the car.

155
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,180
You say they're a... like-minded community.

156
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,260
Like-minded how?

157
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,930
We live, we trade, we fight the dead.

158
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,980
Sometimes others.

159
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,170
Line up.

160
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,210
Okay. This is a waste of time.

161
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,360
Come on. Let's go.

162
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,230
Maybe you're right.

163
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,950
The King is a busy man.

164
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,930
And it's a dangerous world.

165
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,730
We don't usually allow a pack of strangers

166
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,940
to waltz through our door.

167
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,190
We want to make the world less dangerous,

168
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,690
and we are all here to show the King

169
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,630
how serious we are about that.

170
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,590
The car stays outside.

171
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,140
You gotta hand over your guns.

172
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,590
We only have two.

173
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,020
Okay.

174
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,460
Follow me.

175
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,160
Before we go in,

176
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,780
you have a brain and a backbone,

177
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,510
so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.

178
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,280
Whatever you're trying to start here,

179
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,770
another protection pact, a trade,

180
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,570
none of it matters

181
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,670
if we don't start dealing with the real problem --

182
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,980
the Saviors.

183
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,720
You know, Richard, I've never seen you smile.

184
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,960
I think that's gonna change today.

185
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,300
They have the numbers.

186
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
But can they fight?

187
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,590
Oh, they can fight.

188
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,580
Maybe.

189
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,250
Morgan?

190
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,390
How do you know each other?

191
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,370
We go back to the start.

192
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
Well, the King is ready to see you.

193
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,510
- Did you find Carol? - I did, yeah.

194
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,840
Where is she? Is she okay?

195
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,750
She was here, and then she left.

196
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,460
You know, she wasn't too happy, me following her.

197
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,760
She wanted to get away from us, from everyone.

198
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,600
But when I found her, she was shot.

199
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,640
It was just a graze. I got her back here.

200
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,650
They got doctors. They're good.

201
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,390
Was it them?

202
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,070
It was.

203
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,640
She had crossed with some of them,

204
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,400
and one of them followed her, tried to kill her,

205
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,510
but I stopped him.

206
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,370
I killed him.

207
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,380
I had to.

208
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,850
Carol was here.

209
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,920
She got help.

210
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,270
Now she's gone.

211
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,580
Jesus!

212
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,730
It pleases me to see you, old friend.

213
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,010
- It pleases him, indeed! - Jerry.

214
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,860
Tell me,

215
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,180
what news do you bring good King Ezekiel?

216
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,170
Are these new allies you've brought me?

217
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,970
Indeed, they are, Your Majesty.

218
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,310
This is...

219
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,430
Oh, right. I forgot to mention that --

220
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,580
Yeah, a tiger.

221
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,470
This is Rick Grimes,

222
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,970
the leader of Alexandria,

223
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,760
and these are some of his people.

224
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,840
I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.

225
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,660
Now, what brings you to our fair land?

226
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,580
Why do you seek an audience with the King?

227
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,990
Ezekiel --

228
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,370
King...Ezekiel.

229
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,320
Alexandria,

230
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,420
the Hilltop,

231
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,570
and the Kingdom --

232
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,570
all three of our communities have something in common.

233
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,530
We all serve the Saviors.

234
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,630
Alexandria already fought them once,

235
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,700
and we won.

236
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,490
We thought we took out the threat,

237
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,540
but we don't know then what we know now.

238
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,500
We only beat one outpost.

239
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,400
We've been told you have a deal with them,

240
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,610
that you know them.

241
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,940
Then you know

242
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,050
they rule through violence and fear.

243
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,980
Your Majesty, I only told them of the --

244
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,070
Our deal with the Saviors is not known among my people --

245
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,510
for good cause.

246
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,160
We made you a party to that secret

247
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,450
when you told us of the Hilltop's own travails,

248
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,590
but we did not expect you to share --

249
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,670
We can help each other.

250
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,020
Don't interrupt the King.

251
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,520
We brought you into our confidence.

252
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,380
Why did you break it?

253
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,160
Because I want you to hear Rick's plans.

254
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,960
And what plans have you,

255
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,760
Rick Grimes of Alexandria?

256
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,230
We came to ask the Kingdom, to ask you,

257
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,540
to join us in fighting the Saviors,

258
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,190
fighting for freedom for all of us.

259
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,460
What you are asking is very serious.

260
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,040
Several of our people -- good people...

261
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,730
were killed by the Saviors, brutally.

262
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,730
Who?

263
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,810
Abraham.

264
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,170
Glenn.

265
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,820
Spencer, Olivia.

266
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,760
Eugene was taken.

267
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,270
They took Daryl.

268
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,580
He escaped.

269
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,450
Every second he's out here, he's a target.

270
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,510
You gonna say you were right?

271
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,420
No.

272
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,310
I'm...

273
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,490
I'm just real sorry they're gone.

274
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,450
Negan murdered Glenn and Abraham,

275
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,340
beat them to death.

276
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,270
Terrorized the Hilltop,

277
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,020
set loose walkers just to make a point.

278
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,200
I used to think the deal was something we could live with.

279
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,860
A lot of us did.

280
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,020
But that's changing.

281
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,790
So let's change the world, Your Majesty.

282
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,180
I want to be honest about what we're asking.

283
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,620
My people are strong, but there's not enough of us.

284
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,020
We don't have guns... not enough, at least.

285
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,060
Not a lot of weapons, period.

286
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,250
We have people.

287
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,860
And weapons.

288
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,380
If we strike first, together, we can beat them.

289
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,660
Your Majesty,

290
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,220
no more waiting for things to get worse

291
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,770
beyond what we can handle.

292
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,940
We set things right.

293
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,780
The time is now.

294
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,360
Morgan, what say you?

295
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,280
Me?

296
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,030
Speak.

297
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,050
People will die.

298
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,570
A lot of people, and not just the Saviors. It...

299
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,700
If we can find another way,

300
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,710
we have to.

301
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,330
Maybe it's just about Negan...

302
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,910
just capturing him, holding him.

303
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,630
Maybe...

304
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,060
I...

305
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,030
The hour grows late.

306
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,850
Rick Grimes of Alexandria...

307
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,310
you have given the King much to ponder.

308
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,410
Well, when I was a kid,

309
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,140
my mother told me a story.

310
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,280
There was a road to a kingdom,

311
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,150
and there was a rock in the road.

312
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,590
And people would just avoid it,

313
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,600
but horses would break their legs on it and die,

314
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
wagon wheels would come off.

315
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,610
People would lose the goods they'd be coming to sell.

316
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,190
That's what happened to a little girl.

317
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,300
The cask of beer her family brewed fell right off.

318
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,250
It broke.

319
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,420
Dirt soaked it all up, and it was gone.

320
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,490
That was her family's last chance.

321
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,620
They were hungry. They didn't have any money.

322
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,940
She just... sat there and cried, but...

323
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,140
...she wondered why it was still there...

324
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,480
for it to hurt someone else.

325
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,980
So she dug at that rock in the road with her hands till they bled,

326
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,190
used everything she had to pull it out.

327
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,440
It took hours.

328
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,350
And then...

329
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,480
...when she was gonna fill it up,

330
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,990
she saw something in it.

331
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,170
It was a bag of gold.

332
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,930
All right.

333
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,970
The king had put that rock in the road

334
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,310
because he knew the person who dug it out,

335
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,400
who did something,

336
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,530
they deserved a reward.

337
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,860
They deserved to have their life

338
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,880
changed for the good.... forever.

339
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,950
I invite you all to sup with us

340
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,990
and stay till the morrow.

341
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,680
Yeah, we need to get back home.

342
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,790
I shall deliver my decree in the morn.

343
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,060
Sorry.

344
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,100
I...

345
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,400
Sorry.

346
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,840
I thought you were one of the dead.

347
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,180
Why didn't you just run the other way?

348
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,910
Well, I'm...I'm training.

349
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,070
I'm pushing myself,

350
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,790
trying to step up.

351
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,280
Put the safety back on.

352
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,600
Practicing shooting.

353
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,510
Let me give you some advice.

354
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,040
It's gonna be dark soon.

355
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,750
Don't wander around out here on your own.

356
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,030
You'll get yourself killed.

357
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,590
Same goes for you, too, right?

358
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,560
You're not me.

359
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,600
Go home, Benjamin.

360
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,550
- Well, I...Wha...  - ?What?

361
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,010
Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here to check on you.

362
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,850
He doesn't want to bug you,

363
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,710
but he needs to know that you're okay.

364
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,400
He told you that?

365
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,390
No.

366
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,380
But I know him.

367
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,700
Well, tell him...

368
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,510
I can't.

369
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,640
He looks out for the people that he cares about.

370
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,340
Do you want some food?

371
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,930
A bottle of water?

372
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,100
I carry extra in case I run into someone who needs it.

373
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,890
Why?

374
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,170
There's not a lot of us left.

375
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,520
Have to help each other.

376
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,730
Maybe I'll see you again.

377
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,050
Maybe.

378
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,910
Heel-toe, heel-toe out here.

379
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,050
Bend at your knees.

380
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:50,900
You want to keep quiet.

381
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,810
I heard you from a mile away.

382
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,330
Okay.

383
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,080
And when this happens,

384
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,640
and when we allow freedom to ring...

385
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet,

386
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,700
from every state and every city,

387
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,310
we will be able to speed up that day

388
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,980
when all of God's children,

389
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,170
black men and white men,

390
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,420
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,

391
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,110
will be able to join hands

392
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,900
and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual --

393
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,610
Free at last, Free at last!

394
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,200
Thank God Almighty,

395
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,400
we are...free at last.

396
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,370
Thanks for stepping in on story duty.

397
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,850
I stopped in to say good night.

398
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,080
You missed supper. Where were you?

399
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,420
Went for a walk in the woods.

400
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,370
You went out there?

401
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,330
- Unaccompanied? - ?Yeah.

402
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,550
Took out two dead ones on my way back.

403
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,140
Getting pretty good with the stick.

404
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,220
Wanted to practice with the gun.

405
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,490
I, saw Carol out there.

406
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,700
Did she, uh...seem well?

407
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,660
- Did -- Did you talk to her? ?- Yeah.

408
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,270
She asked why I carry food and water

409
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,760
in case I run into people.

410
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,090
And you told her?

411
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,100
It's the same reason we should say yes to Rick.

412
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,210
Elaborate.

413
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,180
You saw their eyes.

414
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,030
They're gonna risk everything if we help them or not.

415
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,820
And if we don't help them, if we turn away,

416
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,530
then they can't win.

417
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,030
And if they do, somehow...

418
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,830
they will have saved us,

419
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,320
and we won't have done a thing.

420
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,060
My dad always said

421
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,650
that if you're asked to be the hero,

422
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,610
be a hero.

423
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,520
You wanted me to be ready for anything, and I am.

424
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,020
We are.

425
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,340
I thank you for your sage counsel.

426
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,670
Your father would be very proud.

427
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,180
The King is very proud.

428
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,590
This is life here.

429
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,600
Every day.

430
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,310
But it came at a cost.

431
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,760
And I wanted more of this.

432
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,070
I wanted to expand.

433
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,970
To create more places like this.

434
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,200
Men and women lost their limbs.

435
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,640
Children lost their parents

436
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,440
because I sent them into battle against the wasted

437
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
when I did not need to.

438
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,080
This is different.

439
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,330
It isn't.

440
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,440
It is.

441
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,740
The dead don't rule us.

442
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,550
The world doesn't look like this outside your walls.

443
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,700
People don't have it as good.

444
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,230
Some people don't have it good at all.

445
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
I have to worry about my people.

446
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,980
You call yourself a damn king.

447
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,650
You sure as hell don't act like one.

448
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,630
All of this...

449
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,630
came at a cost.

450
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,380
It was lives, arms, legs.

451
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,890
The peace we have with the Saviors is uneasy,

452
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,250
but it is peace.

453
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,910
I have to hold on to it.

454
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,680
I have to try.

455
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,130
Although the Kingdom cannot grant you the aid you desire,

456
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,370
the King is sympathetic to your plight.

457
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,590
I offer our friend Daryl asylum

458
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,950
for as long as he requires it.

459
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,830
He will be safe here.

460
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,210
The Saviors do not set foot inside our walls.

461
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
How long do you think that's gonna last?

462
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,950
I knew what was coming.

463
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,060
I knew that King guy would say no.

464
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,010
But it still pissed me off.

465
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,030
What the hell are you telling me for?

466
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,420
We both had sex with the same dead guy.

467
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,950
It doesn't make us friends.

468
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,850
You can change his mind, but you won't.

469
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,530
Then you can stay.

470
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,820
We can talk.

471
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,580
How many people do we have?

472
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,410
To fight?

473
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,490
I'll go with you.

474
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,260
We don't even have enough

475
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,650
to take on one outpost face-to-face yet.

476
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,090
So the Kingdom has to get involved,

477
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,980
or the Saviors will always be in charge.

478
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,560
It isn't about soldiers.

479
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,290
We're making them stronger.

480
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,470
The more food we give them,

481
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,180
the more arms, the more everything,

482
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,060
every day any of us give them something,

483
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
they become harder and harder to beat.

484
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,410
All right, open it up. We're gone.

485
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,060
You're not.

486
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,180
I'm not staying here.

487
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,520
You have to.

488
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,330
It's the smartest play.

489
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,290
You know it is.

490
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,830
Try to talk to Ezekiel.

491
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,380
Or stare him into submission --

492
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,660
Whatever it takes.

493
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,910
We'll be back soon.

494
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,340
For anyone out there

495
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,640
who loved the obese bastard as much as I did,

496
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,280
I just want to say a few words.

497
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,660
Fat Joey was not the most badass son of bitch,

498
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,130
but he was loyal.

499
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,710
He had a great sense of humor.

500
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,870
In fact, we were just joking about oral sex

501
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,850
with Lucille the other day.

502
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,820
Things will not be the same now that he's dead.

503
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,440
Without Fat Joey,

504
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:25,120
Skinny Joey is just Joey.

505
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,700
So it's a goddamn tragedy.

506
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,490
So, let's have a moment of silence.

507
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,330
Someone's trying to block the way.

508
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,030
Gotta be the Saviors.

509
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,890
Look.

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,210
I think that's their base over there.

511
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,110
Yeah, that's it.

512
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,750
Must be trying to make it hard to get to them.

513
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,220
We gotta keep going.

514
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,360
We'll move them, and then we'll move them back.

515
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,340
They don't need to know we were here.

516
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,000
Rick.

517
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,680
Come take a look at this.

518
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,370
What's all this for?

519
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,990
Wait.

520
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,450
When I was hiding in the back of the truck,

521
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,070
I heard a couple of them talking about this.

522
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,450
This is for a herd.

523
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,610
That's why it's a steel cable.

524
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,620
It's not just for one walker.

525
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,990
It's for a lot.

526
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,150
We need these explosives.

527
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,880
Yeah.

528
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,260
But we have to figure out how to disarm it first.

529
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,110
Okay.

530
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,570
Backing up is not gonna make a difference

531
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,930
if this thing goes off.

532
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,150
We got ourselves a red situation.

533
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,790
I need a search party.

534
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,370
See if Daryl ran home like the dumb animal that he is.

535
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,770
On it. Be there in time for lunch.

536
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,090
Turn that sleepy little burg upside down.

537
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,000
We gotta go.

538
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,300
We gotta get there before them, but we need these.

539
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,510
- We need to clear a path anyway. - Yeah.

540
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,200
Rosita?

541
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,040
First part's done.

542
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,730
What now? We gotta unwrap the secondary explosives --

543
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,260
the dynamite, the RPGs.

544
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,910
Make sure these casings are not messed up,

545
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,890
and do not mess them up, either.

546
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,220
This thing could still blow.

547
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,860
You all heard her. Let's go.

548
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,180
You can load the explosives into the trunk as long as they're in good shape.

549
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,460
No dents, no tears. They're not live.

550
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,300
They still need to be triggered to be set off.

551
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,320
Not that one.

552
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,850
- I don't like the way it looks. - Okay.

553
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,830
Dad.

554
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,810
Look.

555
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,710
Okay. There they are.

556
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,330
But they're far.

557
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,910
We still have time.

558
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,670
You sure?

559
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,570
We need these.

560
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,540
And we need to get the cars back in front of the onramp.

561
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,630
They'll know we took their explosives, so does it matter?

562
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,400
- We want that herd to stay on the highway. - ?Why?

563
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,060
We may need it.

564
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,960
Okay. Tara, Carl, come on!

565
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,250
Uh...Rick...

566
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,990
All right.

567
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,580
Sasha, Jesus,

568
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,700
can you get back to the Hilltop on foot?

569
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,910
Yeah.

570
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,440
Tell Maggie we're not giving up.

571
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,550
Go!

572
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,680
Here.

573
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,340
We need every stick, every RPG.

574
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,040
Yeah.

575
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,550
Rick.

576
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,080
They're gonna cut them off.

577
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,240
Can we just split up?

578
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,280
No.

579
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,330
The cars.

580
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,720
If they run...

581
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,520
We lay on the horn when we start it --

582
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,510
I'll bring my arm down, and we go. ?Yes.

583
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,900
Stay together!

584
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,980
- Damn it! ?- We'll figure it out.

585
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,270
Yeah, I didn't like the look of that shit at all.

586
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,440
I pushed it.

587
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,900
I pushed it.

588
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,570
We're here.

589
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,420
You can smile.

590
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,920
We made it.

591
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,430
We can make it.

592
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,610
We can.

593
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,070
We're the ones who live.

594
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,300
Lose the car?

595
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,890
Uh, it's somewhere safe.

596
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,900
- You didn't find anything. ?- No.

597
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,300
Listen, we need to get everyone ready.

598
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,350
The--

599
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,570
Rick. Hello.

600
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,420
And...hello again.

601
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,980
We thought it'd be longer.

602
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,680
Do you think we're here for a tribute?

603
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,630
Do you?

604
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,470
Is there another reason?

605
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,060
There is.

606
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,360
We're here for Daryl.

607
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,830
But Negan took Daryl.

608
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,430
Oh, but... then your son showed up,

609
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,420
Daryl went missing --

610
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,360
might those two things be connected?

611
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
They're not.

612
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,520
We didn't know he was gone till right now.

613
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,510
Then this should be easy.

614
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,950
Now, everyone find a buddy.

615
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,810
Gonna have to follow us around.

616
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,990
If he's here,

617
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,570
we really need you all to see him die.

618
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,680
Wow.

619
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,300
These are some bare shelving units.

620
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,180
You guys have a barbecue or something

621
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,470
and not invite us?

622
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,560
Seriously, this is sad.

623
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,820
Hope you're not trying to hide stuff from us,

624
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,110
'cause that generally doesn't go over very well.

625
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,470
We have a lot of people.

626
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,440
It's...getting harder to find stuff,

627
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,260
and our focus lately has been on finding things

628
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,860
that Negan might want.

629
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,950
We're still adjusting to the new system.

630
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,780
We were gonna scavenge more today.

631
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,390
If you just wait, we'll...bring something back.

632
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,670
We'll find more.

633
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,080
Relax.

634
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,940
I'm not here for a pick-up.

635
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,830
Good thing.

636
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,390
But that day is coming,

637
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,740
so you best do whatever you need to.

638
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,050
Dig deep.

639
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,980
Go the extra mile.

640
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,980
Take some risks!

641
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,460
We will.

642
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,450
Well, we will appreciate that.

643
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,120
Thank you for the cooperation, Rick.

644
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,590
My apologies for leaving the place a bit of a mess,

645
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,060
but we got a litany of other shit to attend to.

646
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,570
So do you, I guess.

647
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,540
Tick-tock.

648
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,510
Chop-chop.

649
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,400
Oh! And, Rick...

650
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,090
if Daryl does turn up here

651
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,010
two days from now, two months from now...

652
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,490
hell, two years from now,

653
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,690
just know there's no statute of limitations on this.

654
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,280
Keep that hatchet handy.

655
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,010
You're gonna need it if he turns up with you people.

656
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,170
And it won't turn out the way it did for your boy.

657
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,420
What happened to the pantry?

658
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,540
We don't know.

659
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,210
And we need to talk about Gabriel.

660
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,700
Where is he?

661
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,430
He was on watch the night you all went to scavenge.

662
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,310
I was supposed to take over for him in the morning.

663
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,950
He wasn't at his post.

664
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,620
Pantry was cleared out and a car was gone.

665
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,030
No one's seen him since.

666
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,490
That son of a bitch.

667
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,600
- He stole our shit and ran. - ?That's...what it looks like.

668
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,040
- Well, I don't want to believe it. - I don't believe it.

669
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,930
That's not Gabriel.

670
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,600
He wouldn't do that to us.

671
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,950
I thought he changed, too,

672
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,550
but it can't be anything else.

673
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,350
Yes, it can.

674
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,500
I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.

675
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,900
I mean, that's -- that's not who he is.

676
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,780
Well, he saw Olivia and Spencer die

677
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,800
right in front of him.

678
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,510
I know. I just...

679
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,990
He found his courage, you know?

680
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,640
I want to believe he held on to it.

681
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,380
Why wouldn't he have taken this with him?

682
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,430
Why would he leave it on the floor?

683
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,980
There weren't tracks out there before.

684
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,920
We didn't find anything now.

685
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,310
Maybe Daryl could've picked something up.

686
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,510
He left.

687
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,200
He didn't leave a note.

688
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,340
He obviously doesn't want to be found.

689
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,990
Yes, he does.

690
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,920
How would he know we were out there?

691
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,800
I don't know.

692
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,670
So that's it?

693
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,160
You're finally leaving me?

694
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,720
You caught me.

695
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm just...

696
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,660
sick of being so damn happy at home, you know?

697
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,910
Didn't know how to tell you.

698
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,380
Babe --

699
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,710
They need me.

700
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,390
Gabriel needs me.

701
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,070
If I ask you something,

702
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,710
will you tell me the truth?

703
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,180
- Of course. - ?The others didn't go out there scavenging, did they?

704
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,480
They're going after them again, and they're not telling us.

705
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,800
Rick has his reasons.

706
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,910
Rick didn't get the shit beaten out of him.

707
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,570
You think this is about Gabriel, but it's gonna be more.

708
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,630
It's always more.

709
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,320
So, please, please don't go.

710
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,600
Gabriel's one of us.

711
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,200
I have to.

712
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,240
What's going on with the Saviors, that isn't this.

713
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,680
If Rick is taking on the Saviors,

714
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,090
that is everything.

715
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,040
W-What if they find out while you're gone?

716
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,080
What if they come back here?

717
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,170
Do you want to leave?

718
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,770
Just turn our backs?

719
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,980
I want us alive.

720
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,830
Both of us.
