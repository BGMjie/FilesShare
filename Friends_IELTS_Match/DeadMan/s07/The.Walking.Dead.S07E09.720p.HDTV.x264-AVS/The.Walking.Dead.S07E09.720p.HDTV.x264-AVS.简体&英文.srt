你告诉我们要准备抗争

现在我能了
and I can now.

00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,300
玛姬说她的人能搞定救世军
Maggie said that her people could take care of the Saviors.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,490
但他们只是让我们的社区陷入险境
But so far all they've done is put our community at risk.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,140
我想让你们帮我劝以西结攻击救世军
I'm asking you to help convince Ezekiel to attack the Saviors

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,650
灭掉他们
and destroy them.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,700
我们会胜利的
We'll win,

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,510
我们要等待合适的时机
we need to wait for the right moment.

10

协议不是这样的
That was not the deal.

33
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,670
你们发誓能干掉救世军
You people swore you could take the Saviors out,

34
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,850
你们失败了
and you failed.

35
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,050
所以我们的协议终结了
So any arrangement we had is now done --

36
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,140
无效了
null and void.

37
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,470
我们不是贸易伙伴  不是朋友
We aren't trade partners, we aren't friends,

38
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,300
从未谋面

懂吗
Hmm?

40
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,750
我们不认识
We don't know each other.

41
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,320
我不欠你什么
I owe you nothing.

42
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,450
实际上  你欠我的  因为我收留了难民
In fact, you owe me for taking in the refugees,

43
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,910
我个人冒了很大的风险
at great personal risk.

44
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,580
你那时真勇敢  待在这里
Oh, you were very brave staying in here

45
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,770
而玛姬和萨沙救了这里
while Maggie and Sasha saved this place.

46
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,530
你的勇气真是鼓舞人心
Your courage was inspiring.

47
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,480
你不是为我工作吗
Hey, don't you work for me?

48
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,660
我们不是朋友吗
Aren't we friends?

Gregory, we already started this.

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,590
我们会赢的
And we're gonna win.

52
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,820
这些人是凶手啊
These are killers.

53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,340
你就想这样活着吗
Is this how you want to live?

54
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,920
受他们的控制  他们还杀你们的人
Under their thumb, killing your people?

55
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,370
有时候我们无法选择

you have to count the blessings you have.

59
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,900
我们能分出多少人
How many people can we spare?

60
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,370
这里有多少人可以战斗
How many people here can fight?

61
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,250
我们
"We"?

62
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,050
我都不知道我们有多少人  玛格丽特
I don't even know how many people we have, Margaret.

63
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,580
这重要吗
And does it even matter?

64
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,550
我是说
I mean...

65
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,310
你们想做什么
...w-w-what are you gonna do?

66
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,170
组一队种高粱的农民吗
Start a platoon of sorghum farmers?

67
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,550
因为我们只有这种人
'Cause that's what we got.

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,480
他们种庄稼  不想战斗
They grow things. They're not gonna want to fight.

69
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,580
你错了
You're wrong.

70
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,080
当人们有机会做正确的事时
When people have the chance to do the right thing,

71
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,910
他们一般会挺身而出
they usually step up.

72
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,870
-人们就  -在你开始唱歌之前
- I mean, people just -- - L-Let me stop you

73
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,330
我先打断你一下  好吗
before you break into song, okay?

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,730
顺便说一句
And, by the way,

75
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,030
谁来给这些炮灰训练
who would train all this cannon fodder?

76
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,340
-我来  -给我一周时间
- I will. - Give me a week.

77
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,770
我是反问  好吗
Rhetorical, okay?

78
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,050
我不想知道
I don't want to know.

79
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,190
我再也不想听到关于此事的半个字
I never want to hear another word about any of it, ever.

80
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,210
没了救世军  我们是不是过得更好
Would we be better off without the Saviors,

81
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,660
-是或不是  -是  好吧
- yes or no? - Yeah. Sure. Okay.

82
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,120
那你要怎么解决问题
So, what will you do to fix the problem?

83
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,150
我没说过我们有问题
I didn't say we had a problem.

84
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,090
是你们说的
You did.

85
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,910
在我管辖范围之外发生的事
And what happens outside of my purview

86
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,880
与我无关
is outside of my purview.

87
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,480
搞什么
What the hell, man?

88
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,520
你要么站我们这边  要么不站
You're either with us or you ain't.

89
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,920
你坐在那里见风使舵  嘴里没实话
You're sitting over there talking out of both sides of your mouth.

90
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,980
我想我已经说得很清楚了
I -- I think I've made my position very clear.

91
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,520
我想感谢你们所有人今天没有来
And I want to thank all of you for not being here today

92
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,430
没跟我会面
and not having this meeting with me

93
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,720
出去时也别让人看见了
or -- or being seen on your way out.

94
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,990
换句话说  从后门走
In other words, go out the back.

95
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,620
-懦夫  -真想打掉那蠢货的牙齿
- Walking ballsack. - ?Wanna knock that idiot's teeth out.

96
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,460
反正我们也不需要他
Yeah, well, we don't need him anyway.

97
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,970
没错
Yeah, that's right.

98
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,860
因为我们有玛姬  萨沙和耶稣
'Cause we have Maggie and Sasha and Jesus here.

99
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,900
还有
And...

100
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,280
伊妮德
Enid.

101
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,510
-嗨  -怎么了
- Hey, um -- - What's wrong?

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,340
没什么
Nothing.

103
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,740
只是
Just...

104
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,650
出来吧
Come outside.

105
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,280
怎么了
What's going on?

106
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,930
如果你不记得了  我是伯蒂
So, if you don't remember, I'm Bertie.

107
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,910
你们救了我两次命
And I owe my life to you all, twice over.

108
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,120
我们许多人都被救过
A bunch of us do.

109
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,950
伊妮德说你们想说服格雷戈里
Enid says that you want Gregory

110
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,810
让我们跟你们一起对抗救世军
to get us to fight the Saviors with you.

111
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,770
这是真的吗
Is that true?

112
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,750
-是的  -你觉得我们能赢吗
- Yes. ?- Do you think we can win,

113
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,670
我们真的能打败他们吗
that we really could beat them?

114
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,440
我们这种人
Us?

115
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,630
是的
I do.

116
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,940
伊妮德说你们能训练我们
Well, Enid says you could show us the way.

117
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,450
-我准备好了  -我也是
- I'm ready. - Me too.

118
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,140
-是啊  -开始吧
-Yeah. -Let's do this.

119
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,340
-开始吧  -我加入
- Let's do it. - I'm in.

120
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,950
-这是个开始  -我们会找到更多人
- It's a start. - We'll get more.

121
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,300
-还是不够  -是啊
- It still won't be enough. - No, it won't.

122
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,350
只要找到合适的东西
Well, we find the right stuff,

123
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,660
也许根本不需要以人数取胜
then maybe we don't need the numbers.

124
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,510
炸飞他们  烧死他们
Blow 'em up, burn 'em to the ground.

125
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,880
你说过救世军里不仅有士兵
You said there weren't just soldiers with the Saviors,

126
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,190
还有工人
that there were workers there.

127
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,930
别无选择的人们
People didn't have a choice.

128
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,290
我们必须赢
We gotta win.

129
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,930
我们需要更多人手  另一个社区
We need more hands, another group.

130
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,010
尼根有前哨站
Negan has outposts.

131
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,680
地形和距离都对我们不利
The geography, the distance works against us.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,090
我们得回去
We gotta get back.

133
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,750
如果他们来找达里尔  我们得在
If they come looking for Daryl, we need to be there.

134
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,970
你们没必要回去
You don't have to get back.

135
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,670
现在没必要
Not yet.

136
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,640
这是他们的长距离对讲机
It's one of theirs, long range.

137
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,530
我们可以偷听  了解他们的动态
We can listen in, keep track of them.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,470
如果我们不回去  那我们做什么
So, if we're not going back, what are we doing, then?

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,810
是时候让你们见以西结了
I think it's time we introduced you to Ezekiel.

140
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,180
以西结国王
King Ezekiel.

141
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,870
国王
King?

142
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,660
那里叫神之国吗
It's called "The Kingdom"?

143
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,010
是啊
Yeah.

144
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,680
名不是我取的
I didn't name it.

145
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,910
还有多远
How much farther?

146
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,670
严格说来  我们已经到了
Well, technically, we're already here.

147
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,660
我是说  我们一直在这里
I mean, we're always here,

148
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,420
但我们到了  神之国
but here we are -- at the Kingdom.

149
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,130
这里是它的外围
Well, its outer edge.

150
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,260
我们等什么呢
Hey, what the hell we waitin' on?

151
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,980
等他们
Waiting for them.

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,460
何人胆敢擅闯神之国领土...
Who dares to trespass on the sovereign land of the --

153
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,360
靠
Oh, shit.

154
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,300
耶稣  是你吗
Jesus, is that you?

155
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,140
这些人是谁  保罗
Who are all these people, Paul?

156
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,620
你好呀  理查德
Hi, Richard.

157
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,650
很高兴见到你
Nice to see you.

158
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,880
我也很高兴见到你
It's good to see you, too.

159
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,740
你的这些朋友们是什么人
Your friends, who are they?

160
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,340
这位是瑞克・格兰姆斯
This is Rick Grimes.

161
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,380
他是一个和我们志同道合的社区的首领
He's the leader of a like-minded community.

162
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,500
这些是他的一部分人马
These are some of his people.

163
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,130
我们想觐见以西结国王
We would like to request an audience with King Ezekiel.

164
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,910
下车
Get out of the car.

165
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,180
你说他们是...志同道合的社区
You say they're a... like-minded community.

166
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,260
怎么个志同道合法
Like-minded how?

167
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,930
我们求生  做交易  和行尸战斗
We live, we trade, we fight the dead.

168
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,980
有时也和别的东西战斗
Sometimes others.

169
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,170
排好队
Line up.

170
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,210
行了  这就是在浪费时间
Okay. This is a waste of time.

171
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,360
走吧  我们回去
Come on. Let's go.

172
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,230
也许你说得对
Maybe you're right.

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,950
国王很繁忙
The King is a busy man.

174
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,930
而这又是个危机四伏的世界
And it's a dangerous world.

175
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,730
我们一般不会让一群陌生人
We don't usually allow a pack of strangers

176
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,940
随意迈进我们的大门
to waltz through our door.

177
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,190
我们想让这个世界不那么危机四伏
We want to make the world less dangerous,

178
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,690
我们都是过来向国王表明
and we are all here to show the King

179
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,630
我们的认真程度的
how serious we are about that.

180
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,590
把车留在外面
The car stays outside.

181
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,140
枪支上缴
You gotta hand over your guns.

182
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,590
我们就两把枪
We only have two.

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,020
好了
Okay.

184
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,460
跟我来
Follow me.

185
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,160
进去之前我想说
Before we go in,

186
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,780
你有勇有谋
you have a brain and a backbone,

187
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,510
所以我和你谈  而不是格雷戈里
so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.

188
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,280
无论你这次来是为了什么
Whatever you're trying to start here,

189
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,770
为了另一条庇护协议  或是交易
another protection pact, a trade,

190
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,570
但这些都毫无意义
none of it matters

191
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,670
除非我们着手处理真正的问题...
if we don't start dealing with the real problem --

192
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,980
救世军
the Saviors.

193
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,720
理查德  我从来没见你笑过
You know, Richard, I've never seen you smile.

194
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,960
这一点今天可能要改变了
I think that's gonna change today.

195
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,300
他们人数是挺多的
They have the numbers.

196
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
但他们能战斗吗
But can they fight?

197
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,590
妥妥的
Oh, they can fight.

198
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,580
也许吧
Maybe.

199
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,250
摩根
Morgan?

200
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,390
你们是怎么认识的
How do you know each other?

201
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,370
灾变刚开始我们就认识了
We go back to the start.

202
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
国王准备好接见你们了
Well, the King is ready to see you.

203
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,510
-你找到卡萝尔了吗  -找到了
- Did you find Carol? - I did, yeah.

204
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,840
她人呢  她没出事吧
Where is she? Is she okay?

205
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,750
她之前在这里  后来离开了
She was here, and then she left.

206
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,460
她不满我跟着她
You know, she wasn't too happy, me following her.

207
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,760
她想远离我们  远离所有人
She wanted to get away from us, from everyone.

208
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,600
但我找到她时  她中枪了
But when I found her, she was shot.

209
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,640
只是擦伤  我把她带回了这里
It was just a graze. I got her back here.

210
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,650
这里有医生  挺厉害的
They got doctors. They're good.

211
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,390
是他们干的吗
Was it them?

212
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,070
是的
It was.

213
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,640
她与他们中几人发生了冲突
She had crossed with some of them,

214
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,400
然后其中一个跟着她  想要杀了她
and one of them followed her, tried to kill her,

215
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,510
但我阻止了他
but I stopped him.

216
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,370
我杀了他
I killed him.

217
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,380
我必须这么做
I had to.

218
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,850
卡萝尔之前在这里的
Carol was here.

219
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,920
她得到了帮助
She got help.

220
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,270
如今她离开了
Now she's gone.

221
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,580
耶稣
Jesus!

222
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,730
很高兴见到你  老朋友
It pleases me to see you, old friend.

223
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,010
-他确实很高兴  -杰瑞
- It pleases him, indeed! - Jerry.

224
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,860
告诉我
Tell me,

225
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,180
你给好国王以西结带来了什么消息
what news do you bring good King Ezekiel?

226
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,170
这些你是给我带来的新盟友吗
Are these new allies you've brought me?

227
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,970
确实是的  陛下
Indeed, they are, Your Majesty.

228
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,310
这位是...
This is...

229
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,430
对了  我忘了和你们说...
Oh, right. I forgot to mention that --

230
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,580
对  有只老虎
Yeah, a tiger.

231
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,470
这位是瑞克・格兰姆斯
This is Rick Grimes,

232
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,970
亚历山大的首领
the leader of Alexandria,

233
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,760
这些是他的一部分人马
and these are some of his people.

234
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,840
欢迎各位来到神之国  旅人们
I welcome you all to the Kingdom, good travelers.

235
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,660
你们为何来到我们美丽的国土
Now, what brings you to our fair land?

236
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,580
你们为何求见本王
Why do you seek an audience with the King?

237
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,990
以西结...
Ezekiel --

238
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,370
以西结...国王
King...Ezekiel.

239
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,320
亚历山大
Alexandria,

240
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,420
山顶寨
the Hilltop,

241
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,570
神之国...
and the Kingdom --

242
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,570
我们这三个社区有一个共同点
all three of our communities have something in common.

243
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,530
我们都供奉救世军
We all serve the Saviors.

244
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,630
亚历山大曾和他们干过一架
Alexandria already fought them once,

245
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,700
我们赢了
and we won.

246
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,490
我们以为自己解决了威胁
We thought we took out the threat,

247
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,540
但我们那时没有摸清敌情
but we don't know then what we know now.

248
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,500
我们只是端掉了一个哨站
We only beat one outpost.

249
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,400
我们得知你和他们做了交易
We've been told you have a deal with them,

250
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,610
你了解他们
that you know them.

251
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,940
那你一定知道
Then you know

252
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,050
他们是用暴力和恐惧进行统治的
they rule through violence and fear.

253
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,980
陛下  我只告诉了他们...
Your Majesty, I only told them of the --

254
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,070
我的人民并不知道我们和救世军的交易...
Our deal with the Saviors is not known among my people --

255
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,510
这是有正当理由的
for good cause.

256
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,160
因为你和我们说了山顶寨所受的苦
We made you a party to that secret

257
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,450
我们才向你透露了那个秘密
when you told us of the Hilltop's own travails,

258
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,590
但我们没想到你会向别人泄密...
but we did not expect you to share --

259
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,670
我们可以互相帮助
We can help each other.

260
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,020
不准打断国王
Don't interrupt the King.

261
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,520
我们信任你
We brought you into our confidence.

262
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,380
你为何要破坏这份信任
Why did you break it?

263
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,160
因为我想让你听听瑞克的计划
Because I want you to hear Rick's plans.

264
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,960
你有何计划呢
And what plans have you,

265
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,760
亚历山大的瑞克・格兰姆斯
Rick Grimes of Alexandria?

266
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,230
我们来此请求神之国  请求你
We came to ask the Kingdom, to ask you,

267
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,540
加入我们  一起反抗救世军
to join us in fighting the Saviors,

268
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,190
为所有人的自由而战
fighting for freedom for all of us.

269
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,460
你的请求很危险
What you are asking is very serious.

270
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,040
我们有好几个人  他们都是好人
Several of our people -- good people...

271
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,730
被救世军残忍杀害了
were killed by the Saviors, brutally.

272
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,730
谁
Who?

273
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,810
亚伯拉罕
Abraham.

274
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,170
格伦
Glenn.

275
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,820
斯宾塞  奥利维亚
Spencer, Olivia.

276
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,760
尤金被劫走了
Eugene was taken.

277
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,270
他们也劫持过达里尔
They took Daryl.

278
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,580
他逃了出来
He escaped.

279
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,450
只要他没被抓回去  他就是个目标
Every second he's out here, he's a target.

280
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,510
你想说自己是对的吗
You gonna say you were right?

281
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,420
不
No.

282
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,310
我
I'm...

283
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,490
他们的死  我非常遗憾
I'm just real sorry they're gone.

284
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,450
尼根杀害了格伦和亚伯拉罕
Negan murdered Glenn and Abraham,

285
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,340
活活砸死了他们
beat them to death.

286
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,270
恐吓山顶寨
Terrorized the Hilltop,

287
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,020
放出行尸  只为立威
set loose walkers just to make a point.

288
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,200
我曾以为我们能忍受他们的协议
I used to think the deal was something we could live with.

289
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,860
很多人都这样以为
A lot of us did.

290
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,020
但情况变了
But that's changing.

291
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,790
所以让我们改变世界吧  陛下
So let's change the world, Your Majesty.

292
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,180
我想坦白说出我们的请求
I want to be honest about what we're asking.

293
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,620
我的人很强  但人手不够
My people are strong, but there's not enough of us.

294
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,020
我们没枪  至少不够
We don't have guns... not enough, at least.

295
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,060
没有足够的武器  就这样
Not a lot of weapons, period.

296
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,250
我们有人手
We have people.

297
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,860
也有武器
And weapons.

298
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,380
如果我们联盟  先下手为强  就能打败他们
If we strike first, together, we can beat them.

299
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,660
陛下
Your Majesty,

300
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,220
不要再等着事情发展到
no more waiting for things to get worse

301
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,770
不可收拾的地步了
beyond what we can handle.

302
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,940
我们要扭转事态
We set things right.

303
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,780
时机正好
The time is now.

304
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,360
摩根  你怎么看
Morgan, what say you?

305
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,280
我
Me?

306
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,030
说吧
Speak.

307
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,050
会死人
People will die.

308
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,570
会死很多人  不仅是救世军  还有...
A lot of people, and not just the Saviors. It...

309
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,700
如果能找到更好的办法
If we can find another way,

310
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,710
必须找到
we have to.

311
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,330
也许只是尼根的问题
Maybe it's just about Negan...

312
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,910
只要抓住他  扣住他
just capturing him, holding him.

313
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,630
也许
Maybe...

314
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,060
我
I...

315
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,030
时候不早了
The hour grows late.

316
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,850
亚历山大的瑞克・格兰姆斯
Rick Grimes of Alexandria...

317
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,310
国王要深思你的话
you have given the King much to ponder.

318
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,410
在我小时候
Well, when I was a kid,

319
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,140
妈妈给我讲过一个故事
my mother told me a story.

320
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,280
从前有条通向王国的路
There was a road to a kingdom,

321
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,150
路中间嵌着一块大石头
and there was a rock in the road.

322
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,590
人们只是绕着它走
And people would just avoid it,

323
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,600
而马匹会被绊到  伤到腿而死
but horses would break their legs on it and die,

324
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
马车轮子会脱落
wagon wheels would come off.

325
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,610
人们损失了很多要卖的货物
People would lose the goods they'd be coming to sell.

326
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,190
一个小女孩就遇到了这种事
That's what happened to a little girl.

327
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,300
她自家酿的啤酒桶掉了下来
The cask of beer her family brewed fell right off.

328
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,250
摔坏了
It broke.

329
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,420
酒都渗进土里  没了
Dirt soaked it all up, and it was gone.

330
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,490
那是她家最后的指望
That was her family's last chance.

331
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,620
他们挨饿  没钱买吃的
They were hungry. They didn't have any money.

332
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,940
她只能坐在那里哭  但是
She just... sat there and cried, but...

333
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,140
她不明白为什么石头还在那
...she wondered why it was still there...

334
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,480
伤害着其他人
for it to hurt someone else.

335
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,980
所以她用双手去挖石头  直到血流不止
So she dug at that rock in the road with her hands till they bled,

336
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,190
用尽力气把它搬了出来
used everything she had to pull it out.

337
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,440
花了好几个小时
It took hours.

338
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,350
然后
And then...

339
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,480
当她准备填坑的时候
...when she was gonna fill it up,

340
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,990
她看到坑里有东西
she saw something in it.

341
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,170
是一袋金子
It was a bag of gold.

342
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,930
真好
All right.

343
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,970
是国王埋下的那块石头
The king had put that rock in the road

344
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,310
因为他知道  肯挖出它的人
because he knew the person who dug it out,

345
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,400
肯动手的人
who did something,

346
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,530
他们值得受奖
they deserved a reward.

347
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,860
他们值得过上
They deserved to have their life

348
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,880
更好的生活  直到永远
changed for the good.... forever.

349
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,950
我邀请你们共进晚餐
I invite you all to sup with us

350
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,990
并留宿到明天
and stay till the morrow.

351
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,680
我们得回去
Yeah, we need to get back home.

352
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,790
清晨我会降旨
I shall deliver my decree in the morn.

353
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,060
抱歉
Sorry.

354
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,100
我
I...

355
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,400
抱歉
Sorry.

356
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,840
我以为是行尸
I thought you were one of the dead.

357
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,180
你为什么不掉头跑掉
Why didn't you just run the other way?

358
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,910
我  我在训练
Well, I'm...I'm training.

359
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,070
逼迫自己
I'm pushing myself,

360
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,790
直面困难
trying to step up.

361
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,280
把保险上好
Put the safety back on.

362
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,600
我在练习射击
Practicing shooting.

363
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,510
给你点建议
Let me give you some advice.

364
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,040
天快黑了
It's gonna be dark soon.

365
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,750
别一个人溜达
Don't wander around out here on your own.

366
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,030
会没命的
You'll get yourself killed.

367
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,590
你也不该转悠  不是吗
Same goes for you, too, right?

368
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,560
你不是我
You're not me.

369
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,600
回家吧  本杰明
Go home, Benjamin.

370
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,550
-那个  我  -什么
- Well, I...Wha...  - ?What?

371
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,010
以西结会时常来看望你
Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here to check on you.

372
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,850
他不想打扰你
He doesn't want to bug you,

373
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,710
但他得知道你是否还好
but he needs to know that you're okay.

374
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,400
他跟你说的吗
He told you that?

375
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,390
不是
No.

376
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,380
但我了解他
But I know him.

377
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,700
那就告诉他...
Well, tell him...

378
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,510
我不能
I can't.

379
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,640
他对在意的人都会照料倍至
He looks out for the people that he cares about.

380
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,340
你想要吃的吗
Do you want some food?

381
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,930
或者水
A bottle of water?

382
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,100
我多带了一些以防碰到有需要的人
I carry extra in case I run into someone who needs it.

383
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,890
为什么
Why?

384
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,170
因为人已经所剩不多了
There's not a lot of us left.

385
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,520
得互相帮助
Have to help each other.

386
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,730
或许还会再见到你
Maybe I'll see you again.

387
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,050
或许吧
Maybe.

388
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,910
在外面脚步要轻
Heel-toe, heel-toe out here.

389
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,050
膝盖弯着走
Bend at your knees.

你得安静点
You want to keep quiet.

老远就听到你了

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,330
好
Okay.

393
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,080
待一切开始时
And when this happens,

394
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,640
待自由之声响起时
and when we allow freedom to ring...

395
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
响彻每个村庄  每个小镇
when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet,

396
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,700
每个州  每个城市时
from every state and every city,

397
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,310
我们将能加速那一天的到来
we will be able to speed up that day

398
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,980
那时  上帝的所有子民

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,170
黑人和白人

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,110
能携手并进
will be able to join hands

402
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,900
合唱那首古老的黑人灵歌
and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual --

403
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,610
终于自由了  终于自由了
Free at last, Free at last!

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,200
感谢全能的上帝
Thank God Almighty,

405
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,400

你没来吃晚餐  你去哪了
You missed supper. Where were you?

409
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,420
去林子里散了散步
Went for a walk in the woods.

410

You went out there?

棍子使得不错了
Getting pretty good with the stick.

414
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,220
想练练枪法
Wanted to practice with the gun.

415
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,490
我看到卡萝尔在外面
I, saw Carol out there.

416
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,700
她看起来还好吗
Did she, uh...seem well?

417
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,660
-你跟她说话了吗  -说了
- Did -- Did you talk to her? ?- Yeah.

418
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,270
她问我为什么带着食物和水
She asked why I carry food and water

419
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,760
以防遇到别人
in case I run into people.

420
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,090
你告诉她了吗
And you told her?

421
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,100
那也是为什么我们该答应瑞克
It's the same reason we should say yes to Rick.

422
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,210
说来听听
Elaborate.

423
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,180
你看到了他们的眼神
You saw their eyes.

424
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,030
有没有我们的帮助  他们都会搏命的
They're gonna risk everything if we help them or not.

425
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,820
如果我们不帮他们  对他们置之不理
And if we don't help them, if we turn away,

426
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,530
他们就赢不了
then they can't win.

427
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,030
假设他们赢了
And if they do, somehow...

428
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,830
他们就救了我们
they will have saved us,

429
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,320
我们什么也不用干
and we won't have done a thing.

430
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,060
我爸爸常说
My dad always said

431
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,650
要是有人让你去逞英雄
that if you're asked to be the hero,

432
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,610
那就去逞
be a hero.

433
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,520
你想让我对一切都做好准备  我准备好了  
You wanted me to be ready for anything, and I am.

434
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,020
我们准备好了
We are.

435
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,340
感谢你的建议
I thank you for your sage counsel.

436
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,670
你父亲会非常骄傲的
Your father would be very proud.

437
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,180
国王很骄傲
The King is very proud.

438
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,590
这就是这里的生活
This is life here.

439
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,600
每一天
Every day.

440
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,310
但这是有代价的
But it came at a cost.

441
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,760
我曾想要更多
And I wanted more of this.

442
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,070
我曾想要扩张
I wanted to expand.

443
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,970
建造更多像这里一样的地方
To create more places like this.

444
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,200
人们失去了四肢
Men and women lost their limbs.

445
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,640
孩子们失去了双亲
Children lost their parents

446
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,440
因为我在没必要的时候
because I sent them into battle against the wasted

447
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,760
派他们去与行尸作战
when I did not need to.

448
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,080
这次不同
This is different.

449
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,330
并不是
It isn't.

450
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,440
这次不同
It is.

451
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,740
行尸不会统治支配我们
The dead don't rule us.

452
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,550
外面的世界跟墙内截然不同
The world doesn't look like this outside your walls.

453
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,700
人们过得没这么好
People don't have it as good.

454
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,230
有些人过得凄惨之至
Some people don't have it good at all.

455
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
我只能为我的子民考虑
I have to worry about my people.

456
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,980
你称自己为国王
You call yourself a damn king.

457
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,650
却一点没有国王的样子
You sure as hell don't act like one.

458
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,630
这一切
All of this...

459
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,630
都有代价
came at a cost.

460
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,380
是用生命  残肢断臂换来的
It was lives, arms, legs.

461
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,890
和救世军的和平并不稳定
The peace we have with the Saviors is uneasy,

462
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,250
但起码是和平
but it is peace.

463
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,910
我得把握住
I have to hold on to it.

464
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,680
我得尝试
I have to try.

465
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,130
尽管神之国不能提供你们需要的协助
Although the Kingdom cannot grant you the aid you desire,

466
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,370
但国王同情你的困境
the King is sympathetic to your plight.

467
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,590
我可以为友人达里尔提供庇护
I offer our friend Daryl asylum

468
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,950
他想留多久都行
for as long as he requires it.

469
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,830
他在这里很安全
He will be safe here.

470
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,210
救世军不会进入我们的围墙
The Saviors do not set foot inside our walls.

471
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
你觉得这种情况能撑多久
How long do you think that's gonna last?

472
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,950
我知道会发生什么
I knew what was coming.

473
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,060
我知道那个国王会拒绝
I knew that King guy would say no.

474
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,010
但我还是很生气
But it still pissed me off.

475
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,030
你跟我讲这个干什么
What the hell are you telling me for?

476
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,420
我们睡过同一个死人
We both had sex with the same dead guy.

477
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,950
不代表我们是朋友了
It doesn't make us friends.

478
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,850
你能改变他的心意  但你不愿这么做
You can change his mind, but you won't.

479
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,530
那你可以留下来
Then you can stay.

480
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,820
我们聊聊
We can talk.

481
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,580
我们有多少人
How many people do we have?

482
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,410
能战斗的
To fight?

483
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,490
我跟你们走
I'll go with you.

484
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,260
我们连从正面
We don't even have enough

485
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,650
攻下一个哨站的人手都不够
to take on one outpost face-to-face yet.

486
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,090
所以神之国必须加入进来
So the Kingdom has to get involved,

487
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,980
否则救世军会一直掌管一切
or the Saviors will always be in charge.

488
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,560
不是士兵的问题
It isn't about soldiers.

489
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,290
是我们使他们变得更强
We're making them stronger.

490
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,470
给他们的食物越多
The more food we give them,

491
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,180
武器越多  或者任何东西更多
the more arms, the more everything,

492
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,060
每天我们中有人给他上贡
every day any of us give them something,

493
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
他们就会变得越难被打败
they become harder and harder to beat.

494
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,410
好了  开门  我们走
All right, open it up. We're gone.

495
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,060
你不能走
You're not.

496
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,180
我不能留在这
I'm not staying here.

497
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,520
你必须留下
You have to.

498
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,330
这是最聪明的做法
It's the smartest play.

499
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,290
你心里清楚
You know it is.

500
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,830
试着跟以西结谈谈
Try to talk to Ezekiel.

501
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,380
或者一直盯着他直到他妥协
Or stare him into submission --

502
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,660
不管用什么方法
Whatever it takes.

503
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,910
我们很快回来
We'll be back soon.

504
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,340
致所有
For anyone out there

505
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,640
和我一样爱那个肥鬼的人
who loved the obese bastard as much as I did,

506
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,280
我只想说几句
I just want to say a few words.

507
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,660
肥乔不是最牛逼的那个
Fat Joey was not the most badass son of bitch,

508
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,130
但是他很忠诚
but he was loyal.

509
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,710
他很幽默
He had a great sense of humor.

510
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,870
实际上前两天我们还在开玩笑
In fact, we were just joking about oral sex

511
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,850
和露西尔口交
with Lucille the other day.

512
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,820
他死了一切都不一样了
Things will not be the same now that he's dead.

513
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,440
没了肥乔
Without Fat Joey,

514
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:25,120
瘦乔就只是乔了
Skinny Joey is just Joey.

515
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,700
真他妈悲催
So it's a goddamn tragedy.

516
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,490
让我们默哀片刻
So, let's have a moment of silence.

517
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,330
有人想挡路
Someone's trying to block the way.

518
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,030
肯定是救世军
Gotta be the Saviors.

519
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,890
看
Look.

520
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,210
我想那是他们的基地
I think that's their base over there.

521
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,110
是的
Yeah, that's it.

522
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,750
一定是想让别人难接近他们
Must be trying to make it hard to get to them.

523
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,220
我们得前进
We gotta keep going.

524
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,360
我们移开车  然后再移回来
We'll move them, and then we'll move them back.

525
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,340
他们不会知道我们来过
They don't need to know we were here.

526
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,000
瑞克
Rick.

527
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,680
来看看
Come take a look at this.

528
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,370
这是为了什么
What's all this for?

529
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,990
等等
Wait.

530
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,450
我在卡车后面藏着的时候
When I was hiding in the back of the truck,

531
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,070
听到有几个人讨论
I heard a couple of them talking about this.

532
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,450
是为尸群准备的
This is for a herd.

533
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,610
所以用的是钢索
That's why it's a steel cable.

534
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,620
不只是为了一只行尸
It's not just for one walker.

535
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,990
是为很多
It's for a lot.

536
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,150
我们需要这些炸药
We need these explosives.

537
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,880
是的
Yeah.

538
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,260
但首先我们得想办法拆除
But we have to figure out how to disarm it first.

539
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,110
好吧
Okay.

540
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,570
如果这东西爆炸
Backing up is not gonna make a difference

541
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,930
后退也没用
if this thing goes off.

542
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,150
出现红色事件
We got ourselves a red situation.

543
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,790
派一支搜索队
I need a search party.

544
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,370
看看达里尔有没有犯傻跑回家
See if Daryl ran home like the dumb animal that he is.

545
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,770
就去办  午饭前赶到
On it. Be there in time for lunch.

546
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,090
把那个小破地儿掘地三尺
Turn that sleepy little burg upside down.

547
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,000
我们该走了
We gotta go.

548
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,300
我们得在他们之前回去  但我们需要这些
We gotta get there before them, but we need these.

549
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,510
-我们得清出一条路  -是
- We need to clear a path anyway. - Yeah.

550
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,200
罗西塔
Rosita?

551
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,040
第一部分完成
First part's done.

552
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,730
现在呢  我们得拆掉次级炸药
What now? We gotta unwrap the secondary explosives --

553
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,260
炸药  火箭筒
the dynamite, the RPGs.

554
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,910
确保别装混了
Make sure these casings are not messed up,

555
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,890
也不要乱动
and do not mess them up, either.

556
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,220
这些东西还能炸
This thing could still blow.

557
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,860
都听到了  行动
You all heard her. Let's go.

558
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,180
把完好的炸药装上车
You can load the explosives into the trunk as long as they're in good shape.

559
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,460
不能有凹痕和撕裂  它们没激活
No dents, no tears. They're not live.

560
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,300
还需要被触发引爆
They still need to be triggered to be set off.

561
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,320
别拿这个
Not that one.

562
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,850
-看起来不对劲  -好
- I don't like the way it looks. - Okay.

563
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,830
爸
Dad.

564
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,810
看
Look.

565
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,710
好  它们在那
Okay. There they are.

566
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,330
但还远
But they're far.

567
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,910
我们还有时间
We still have time.

568
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,670
确定吗
You sure?

569
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,570
我们需要这些
We need these.

570
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,540
我们得把车放回斜坡前面
And we need to get the cars back in front of the onramp.

571
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,630
他们会知道我们拿了炸药  有什么用呢
They'll know we took their explosives, so does it matter?

572
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,400
-我们要让尸群留在公路上  -为什么
- We want that herd to stay on the highway. - ?Why?

573
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,060
我们也许会用到
We may need it.

574
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,960
好了  塔拉  卡尔  快来
Okay. Tara, Carl, come on!

575
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,250
瑞克
Uh...Rick...

576
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,990
好了
All right.

577
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,580
萨沙  耶稣
Sasha, Jesus,

578
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,700
你们可以走回山顶寨吗
can you get back to the Hilltop on foot?

579
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,910
可以
Yeah.

580
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,440
告诉玛姬我们不会放弃
Tell Maggie we're not giving up.

581
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,550
走
Go!

582
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,680
给
Here.

583
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,340
我们需要每一根炸药  火箭弹
We need every stick, every RPG.

584
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,040
好
Yeah.

585
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,550
瑞克
Rick.

586
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,080
它们会堵死他们
They're gonna cut them off.

587
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,240
我们分头走吧
Can we just split up?

588
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,280
不行
No.

589
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,330
车
The cars.

590
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,720
如果能开动的话...
If they run...

591
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,520
我们启动的时候鸣笛
We lay on the horn when we start it --

592
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,510
我挥下手一起走  好的
I'll bring my arm down, and we go. ?Yes.

593
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,900
跟上来
Stay together!

594
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,980
-该死  -我们会想办法
- Damn it! ?- We'll figure it out.

595
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,270
我就说看起来不对劲
Yeah, I didn't like the look of that shit at all.

596
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,440
是我硬要做的
I pushed it.

597
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,900
是我硬要做的
I pushed it.

598
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,570
我们在这
We're here.

599
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,420
你可以笑了
You can smile.

600
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,920
我们成功了
We made it.

601
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,430
我们可以做到
We can make it.

602
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,610
我们可以
We can.

603
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,070
我们是活下来的人
We're the ones who live.

604
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,300
车扔了吗
Lose the car?

605
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,890
在安全的地方
Uh, it's somewhere safe.

606
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,900
-你什么都没找到  -没有
- You didn't find anything. ?- No.

607
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,300
听着  我们得让所有人准备好
Listen, we need to get everyone ready.

608
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,350
救...
The--

609
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,570
瑞克  你好
Rick. Hello.

610
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,420
还有  再次你好
And...hello again.

611
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,980
想着你们不会这么快来
We thought it'd be longer.

612
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,680
你以为我们来收贡品吗
Do you think we're here for a tribute?

613
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,630
是不是
Do you?

614
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,470
还有别的原因吗
Is there another reason?

615
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,060
有
There is.

616
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,360
我们来找达里尔
We're here for Daryl.

617
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,830
可尼根抓走了达里尔
But Negan took Daryl.

618
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,430
但是你儿子来了
Oh, but... then your son showed up,

619
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,420
达里尔就失踪了
Daryl went missing --

620
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,360
也许这两件事有关
might those two things be connected?

621
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720
没关
They're not.

622
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,520
我们现在才知道他逃跑了
We didn't know he was gone till right now.

623
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,510
那就简单了
Then this should be easy.

624
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,950
现在  每人找一人
Now, everyone find a buddy.

625
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,810
跟我们走
Gonna have to follow us around.

626
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,990
如果他在这
If he's here,

627
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,570
我们要确保让你们亲眼看他死
we really need you all to see him die.

628
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,680
天啊
Wow.

629
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,300
架子空空如也
These are some bare shelving units.

630
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,180
你们办了烧烤
You guys have a barbecue or something

631
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,470
没叫我们吗
and not invite us?

632
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,560
真的  太悲哀了
Seriously, this is sad.

633
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,820
希望你们没有藏东西
Hope you're not trying to hide stuff from us,

634
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,110
因为那通常没好下场
'cause that generally doesn't go over very well.

635
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,470
我们人很多
We have a lot of people.

636
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,440
找东西越来越难
It's...getting harder to find stuff,

637
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,260
我们最近的重心是寻找
and our focus lately has been on finding things

638
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,860
尼根要的东西
that Negan might want.

639
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,950
我们还在适应新体制
We're still adjusting to the new system.

640
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,780
我们今天会找到更多
We were gonna scavenge more today.

641
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,390
如果你愿意等  我们会带东西回来
If you just wait, we'll...bring something back.

642
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,670
我们会找到更多
We'll find more.

643
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,080
放松
Relax.

644
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,940
我不是来收贡的
I'm not here for a pick-up.

645
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,830
这是好事
Good thing.

646
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,390
但那天快到了
But that day is coming,

647
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,740
所以你们最好做该做的事
so you best do whatever you need to.

648
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,050
好好找
Dig deep.

649
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,980
加倍努力
Go the extra mile.

650
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,980
冒一下险
Take some risks!

651
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,460
我们会的
We will.

652
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,450
我们会感激的
Well, we will appreciate that.

653
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,120
感谢你的合作  瑞克
Thank you for the cooperation, Rick.

654
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,590
抱歉把这里搞乱了
My apologies for leaving the place a bit of a mess,

655
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,060
但是我们还有其他屁事要去做
but we got a litany of other shit to attend to.

656
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,570
我猜你也是
So do you, I guess.

657
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,540
抓紧
Tick-tock.

658
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,510
快点
Chop-chop.

659
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,400
还有  瑞克
Oh! And, Rick...

660
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,090
如果达里尔真在这里出现
if Daryl does turn up here

661
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,010
两天后  两个月后
two days from now, two months from now...

662
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,490
见鬼  两年后
hell, two years from now,

663
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,690
你要知道这事没有诉讼时效
just know there's no statute of limitations on this.

664
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,280
把斧子放在手边
Keep that hatchet handy.

665
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,010
如果他在你们这出现  你会用上的
You're gonna need it if he turns up with you people.

666
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,170
这次可不会像你儿子那次一样了
And it won't turn out the way it did for your boy.

667
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,420
储藏室怎么了
What happened to the pantry?

668
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,540
不清楚
We don't know.

669
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,210
我们得谈谈加百利
And we need to talk about Gabriel.

670
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,700
他在哪
Where is he?

671
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,430
你们去找物资的那晚  他在值班
He was on watch the night you all went to scavenge.

672
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,310
我和他本来应该早上换班
I was supposed to take over for him in the morning.

673
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,950
他没在哨岗上
He wasn't at his post.

674
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,620
储藏室被清空了  少了一辆车
Pantry was cleared out and a car was gone.

675
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,030
没人再看到过他
No one's seen him since.

676
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,490
那个杂种
That son of a bitch.

677
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,600
-他偷东西跑掉了  -看起来是这样
- He stole our shit and ran. - ?That's...what it looks like.

678
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,040
-我不想相信  -我不相信
- Well, I don't want to believe it. - I don't believe it.

679
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,930
加百利不是那样的人
That's not Gabriel.

680
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,600
他不会那样对我们
He wouldn't do that to us.

681
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,950
我也以为他变了
I thought he changed, too,

682
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,550
但没有其他可能
but it can't be anything else.

683
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,350
有的
Yes, it can.

684
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,500
不敢相信他会带我们的东西跑掉
I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.

685
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,900
他不是那样的人
I mean, that's -- that's not who he is.

686
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,780
他看到奥利维亚和斯宾塞死了
Well, he saw Olivia and Spencer die

687
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,800
就在他面前
right in front of him.

688
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:42,510
我知道  我只是...
I know. I just...

689
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,990
他找到了勇气  知道吗
He found his courage, you know?

690
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,640
我真心希望他能坚持住
I want to believe he held on to it.

691
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,380
他为什么不带走这个
Why wouldn't he have taken this with him?

692
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,430
他为什么丢在地板上
Why would he leave it on the floor?

693
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,980
外面没有之前的痕迹
There weren't tracks out there before.

694
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,920
我们没找到什么
We didn't find anything now.

695
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,310
也许达里尔能发现些什么
Maybe Daryl could've picked something up.

696
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,510
他走了
He left.

697
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,200
没留纸条
He didn't leave a note.

698
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:10,340
显然不想被找到
He obviously doesn't want to be found.

699
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,990
他想的
Yes, he does.

700
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,710
船

701
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,920
他怎么知道我们去过那里
How would he know we were out there?

702
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,800
我不知道
I don't know.

703
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,670
就这样吗
So that's it?

704
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,160
你终于要离开我了
You're finally leaving me?

705
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,720
被你发现了
You caught me.

706
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,000
我只是
I'm just...

707
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,660
厌倦了在家里的快乐
sick of being so damn happy at home, you know?

708
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,910
不知道该怎么跟你说
Didn't know how to tell you.

709
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,380
亲爱的
Babe --

710
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,710
他们需要我
They need me.

711
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:54,390
加百利需要我
Gabriel needs me.

712
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,070
如果我问你一件事
If I ask you something,

713
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,710
你能说实话吗
will you tell me the truth?

714
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,180
-当然  -他们不是出去找物资的  对吧
- Of course. - ?The others didn't go out there scavenging, did they?

715
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,480
他们又要抗击了  而他们没告诉我们
They're going after them again, and they're not telling us.

716
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,800
瑞克有他的理由
Rick has his reasons.

717
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,910
瑞克没有被毒打过
Rick didn't get the shit beaten out of him.

718
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,570
你以为这只是去找加百利  但会有更多的事
You think this is about Gabriel, but it's gonna be more.

719
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,630
总会有更多的事
It's always more.

720
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,320
所以拜托了  别走
So, please, please don't go.

721
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,600
加百利是我们的一员
Gabriel's one of us.

722
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,200
我必须去
I have to.

723
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:36,240
救世军的事  与此无关
What's going on with the Saviors, that isn't this.

724
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,680
如果瑞克要对抗救世军
If Rick is taking on the Saviors,

725
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:41,090
那一切都有关
that is everything.

726
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,040
如果你们不在的时候他们发现了呢
W-What if they find out while you're gone?

727
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,080
如果他们回来呢
