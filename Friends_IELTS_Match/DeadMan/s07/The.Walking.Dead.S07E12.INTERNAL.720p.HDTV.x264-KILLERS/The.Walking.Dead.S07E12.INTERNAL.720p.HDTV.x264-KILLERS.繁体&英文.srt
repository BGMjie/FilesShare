我們是能做成事的人
We are the ones who get things done.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,540
我們能找到戰勝他們的方法
We can find a way to beat them.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,430
塔拉  你在外面比我們走得都遠
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,260
至少你能告訴我們別去哪找
The least you can tell is where not to look.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,290

00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,190
別這樣做
Don't do this.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,170
我們要等待合適的時機

槍

今晚你來守吧
Uh, you can keep watch tonight.

18
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,610
我們今天會有收獲嗎

會的
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,990
我們也需要給那個對講機找電池
We're gonna need batteries for that walkie, too.

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,760
讓它重新開始工作
Get it working again.

22
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,620
怎么了  笑什么
What is it? What's that smile?

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,060
我們出來幾天了  結果只找到
Couple of days out, all we got to show are

24
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,800
差不多兩把槍  幾個壓扁的豆子罐頭
two guns, dented cans of beans,

25
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,930
和幾件球衣

26
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,920
差不多吧
Pretty much.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,010
我們在抗爭
We're fightin' the fight.

28

早上好
Good morning.

30
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,100
如果我再聽見關于肥喬的一個字
And if I hear one more goddamn word about Fat Joey,

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
我就要打碎某人的牙齒
I'm gonna smash somebody's teeth in.

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,780
我看是甩掉了累贅
Good riddance to dead weight.

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,440
總算沒什么狗屁吉祥物了
No more mascot crap.

34
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,980
他們對椒鹽脆餅的品位不錯

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,170
還有電池

我們可以再出來  我們應該回去了

再轉會兒

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,450
我們沒事
We're okay.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,670
我們沒必要現在就找到武器
We don't have to find them right now.

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,240
我知道
Yeah, I know.

44

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,540
好
Yeah.

105
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,820
該死
Damn it.

106
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,550
注意腳下
Watch your step.

107
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,940
也許我們不該在這里待太久
Maybe we shouldn't be up here too long.

108
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,090
我們去看看有什么吧
Well, let's see what we're gonna see.

109
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,090
士兵  平民  這些子彈
Soldiers, civilians, all those rounds --

110
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,630
曾有一場惡戰
There was a fight.

111
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,700
也許是行尸
Maybe it was the walkers.

112
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,040
也許是別的人
Maybe just other people.

113
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,860
他們還背著槍
They're still wearing their guns.

114
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,060
我覺得就是這里了
I think this is it.

115
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,990
我也這么想
I think it is, too.

116
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,180
覺得我們可以搞定嗎
Think we can?

117
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,630
可以的
Yeah, we can.

118
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,560
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

119
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
沒事  你呢
Y-Yeah. Are you?

120
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,550
我沒事
I am. ?

121
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,200
這是個預兆  對吧
This is -- This is a sign, right?

122
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,720
是的  肯定是
This is it. It has to be.

123
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,590
的確是
Oh-ho. It is.

124
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,180
即食口糧

125
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,120
它們是即食的
Well, they're ready.

126
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,320
我們吃吧
Let's eat.

127
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,110
我沒找到槍
I didn't find any guns.

128
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,910
如果你想知道的話
In case you were wondering.

129
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,820
我在外面找了一整天  一把都沒找到
I was out there all day and not a damn one.

130
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,720
一把真槍都沒找到
Not a real one.

131
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,870
問題是  我之前有一把槍
Thing is, I had a gun.

132
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,420
我本來打算用它殺了尼根
I was gonna use it to kill Negan.

133
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,830
我都已經準備好了
I was ready to.

134
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,980
假如我當時按計劃做了
And if I had done it, like I'd planned to,

135
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,930
如今尼根已經死了
Negan would be dead right now.

136
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,390
沒錯  也許我也會死  但誰他媽在乎
And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead, too, but who gives a damn?

137
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,680
那樣的話尤金就不會被抓走
Eugene would still be here.

138
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,330
奧利維亞會活著
Olivia would still be alive.

139
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,330
斯賓塞也會活著
Spencer would still be alive.

140
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,970
但如今他們都不在了  我卻還在
And now they're gone, and I'm here

141
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,660
就因為我愚蠢地聽信了你的話
because I was stupid enough to listen to you.

142
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,380
但你聽了
But you were.

143
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,640
也照做了
And you did.

144
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,220
你就站在那里對別人指手畫腳
You stand there telling people about their lives.

145
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,500
只對那些來這里的人
Only if they come here.

146
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,660
比如你
Like you.

147
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,740
就像現在
Right now.

148
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,680
你什么都不懂
You don't know shit about shit.

149
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,690
你說得對
You're right.

150
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,260
我的確不懂
I don't.

151
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,250
我說過你不應該去送死
I said that you weren't supposed to die

152
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,820
不應該去做那件你計劃要做的事
and that you shouldn't do the thing that you were planning to do

153
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,220
因為我們需要你
because we needed you --

154
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,930
我們如今依然需要
still do.

155
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,300
像我這樣的傻瓜都能看清那一點
Even a fool like me could see that.

156
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,400
死了的確更容易些
It's easier to be dead,

157
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,850
假如你還活著是我的錯的話
and if it's my fault you're alive,

158
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,720
那我只能背負著這個錯誤了
well, I'm just gonna have to live with that.

159
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,150
我當時決定要插手
I decided to meddle.

160
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,110
但我做的是我認為正確的事
But I did something I thought was right,

161
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,450
我也知道這事風險很大
and I knew the stakes were very high.

162
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,090
你當然可以因為自己還活著而指責我
You can certainly blame me for the fact that you have a life,

163
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,020
但之后呢  你要怎么辦
but after that what are you going to do with it?

164
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,150
你要如何促成那些必須發生的事
How are you going to make what needs to happen happen?

165
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,370
在你心跳停止之前  一切皆有可能
Anything is possible until your heart stops beating.

166
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,940
你能做的絕不僅僅是沖著個傻子大吼
Certainly more than yelling at a fool.

167
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,500
美國政府財產  嚴禁轉售獲利

168
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,780
即食口糧  
7號菜單
牛腩配肉汁

169
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,290
火雞胸肉

170
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
什么
What?

171
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,420
如何
How is it?

172
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,350
棒極了
It's good.

173
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,410
所以  明天...
So, tomorrow...

174
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,710
我們出去  把武器搶回來  對嗎
we go out there, we get the weapons, right?

175
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,390
然后讓簡迪斯和她的人跟我們一起戰斗
We get Jadis and her people to fight with us.

176
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,700
我們殺死尼根
We kill Negan

177
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,720
以及其他該殺之人  來贏得戰斗
and anyone else we have to to win.

178
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,960
在那之后呢
And what happens after that?

179
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,220
之后  我們繼續生活
After that, we keep going.

180
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,070
是的  但是
Yeah, but...

181
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,130
尼根用他的方法統治世界
Negan ordered the world his way.

182
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,620
他死之后  我們應該建立新秩序  對吧
It's up to us to reorder it once he's gone, right?

183
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,880
所有社區
All the different communities,

184
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,810
可以一起想辦法  討論如何繼續生活
they can figure it out together, how to keep going together.

185
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,080
對  但總得有人促成這事
Yeah, but somebody's gonna have to make that happen.

186
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,740
總得有人負責  對嗎
Somebody will need to be in charge of that, right?

187
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,900
那個人應該是你
It should be you.

188
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,570
-不是我  -為什么
- Not me. - ?Why not?

189
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,740
你可以勝任的
You could do it.

190
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,490
你會做得很好
?You'd be good at it.

191
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,870
如果你想做的話
I mean, if it's something that you wanted.

192
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,650
我不想做  也不愿意做
Well, I don't think I do. Or I would.

193
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,230
但如果是咱們倆  你和我
But the two of us, you and me,

194
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,070
一起重建秩序
reordering things together...

195
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,470
那我愿意
I want that.

196
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,290
假如你也愿意的話...
If it's something you wanted....

197
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,070
我愿意
Yeah.

198
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,940
我要再吃五包這個  好嗎
I'm gonna eat five more of these dinners, okay?

199
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,120
知道嗎
You know...

200
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,150
我們用不著明天就搞定
we don't have to get it done tomorrow.

201
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,250
我們可以悠閑點
We can take our time.

202
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,960
過一兩天再走也沒關系
If we go another day, another one after that, it's fine.

203
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,850
我是說  這地方沒危險
I mean, the place is clear.

204
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,010
嚴嚴實實的
It's locked up tight.

205
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,330
只有一條路能進來  所以
We found the only way in, so...

206
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,750
我們應該回去
We should get back.

207
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
既然能拿到槍
If we're getting the guns,

208
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,900
多費點時間也沒關系
it doesn't matter if it takes a little longer.

209
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,420
等等  我一直
Wait. I've been, um...

210
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,890
在等著給你看這個
I've been waiting to show you this one.

211
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,260
這可是  辣椒  奶酪意面
It's, um, chili and mac and cheese...

212
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,410
大雜燴
together.

213
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
試試吧
Come on.

214
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,360
抱歉
Oh. Sorry.

215
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,850
我在思考
I was just thinking.

216
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,660
什么  你要這個
W..you...you want this?

217
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,400
恭喜
Congrats.

218
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,940
歸你了
It's yours.

219
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,870
是別人送我的  曾經幫助過我的某人
Someone gave it to me, someone who helped me.

220
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,390
她為我不顧一切
She put her ass on the line for me.

221
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,320
她救了我的命  知道嗎
She saved my life, you know?

222
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,330
她本來不用做  但卻做了
She didn't have to. But she did.

223
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,080
如今這是有意義的  毋庸置疑
That means something now -- it does. It has to.

224
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,580
要是我說了  知道嗎
If I say something, you know --

225
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,740
拿不到槍  瑞克是不會離開那里的
Rick won't leave there without their guns.

226
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,350
就算我們能成功接近那里
If -- if we could even get close enough,

227
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,300
她們也會開火  我們會反擊
they'll start firing, and we'll fire back.

228
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,510
她們應該跟我們并肩戰斗的
I mean, they should just fight with us.

229
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,860
救世軍殺了她們的父親
The Saviors killed their fathers

230
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,760
兒子和兄弟
and their sons and their brothers.

231
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,910
但她們不想和我們并肩戰斗
They won't want to fight with us.

232
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,200
她們只想藏起來
They just want to hide.

233
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,640
所以她們只能和我們戰斗
So they'll just fight us.

234
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,350
如果我告訴大家海邊旅館的事  就會這樣
I tell everyone about Oceanside, that's what happens.

235
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,200
憑什么我們的命比他們的更珍貴
What makes our life worth more than theirs?

236
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,950
就因為我們想阻止
Because we want to stop

237
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,480
那些傷害我們的人嗎
the people that are hurting us,

238
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,250
那些會傷害別人的人嗎
who will hurt other people?

239
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,980
該死
God damn it.

240
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,610
看
Look.

241
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,050
行尸在外游蕩  沒有被關起來
The walkers in the field, they're not closed in.

242
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,700
是啊
Yeah.

243
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,540
我們得干掉外面的這些
We got to take care of the ones out here

244
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,230
把缺口堵上  然后再慢慢干掉剩下的
and block that gap, too, so we can take the rest slow.

245
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,280
七  八...
Seven, eight...

246
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,870
九
nine...

247
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,870
我能用那輛車堵上
That car -- I can block it up.

248
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,460
我能干掉擋路的那一個
I can take out that one on the way.

249
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,650
你把剩下的引開
You draw the rest.

250
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,350
你給我留了八個
You're leaving me eight.

251
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,120
我們可以朝它們開槍
We could shoot them,

252
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,890
但這樣會引來其余的行尸
but that would call the rest from the field.

253
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,480
得悄悄行動  用劍
This is about doing it quiet, with the sword.

254
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,300
八個對你來說不是問題
You can handle eight.

255
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,040
你已經干掉八個行尸了  我推得動
You got your eight walkers. I can push.

256
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,550
我也行
So can I.

257
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,240
你只要負責把車開到缺口就行
You just worry about steering us in that gap.

258
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,360
該死
?Shit.

259
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,850
剎車壞了
The brakes don't work.

260
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,230
米瓊恩  你沒事吧
Michonne, you good?

261
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
沒事
Yeah.

262
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,910
你呢
You?

263
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,560
沒事
Yeah.

264
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,100
我覺得我們開過頭了
I think we overshot it.

265
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,950
你覺得還是你確定
You think or you know?

266
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,310
我確定
I know.

267
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,060
不過這是個好計劃
It was a good plan, though.

268
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,770
這個計劃超棒
It was a great plan.

269
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,030
就在這里吧
We'll do it here.

270
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,950
好
Yeah.

271
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,900
該死  這攔不住它們
Shit. It's not gonna hold.

272
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,470
過來了
There it goes!

273
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,500
我們散開  減少它們的數量
Split them off into smaller groups.

274
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,440
柵欄也許能擋住
The barriers might hold.

275
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,910
你去滑梯  我去摩天輪
You take slide, I take Ferris wheel?

276
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,500
或者我們可以直接逃
Or we could just go.

277
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,190
-你想逃嗎  -不  我們能搞定
- You want to go? ?- Nah. We can do this.

278
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,500
我知道我們能
Yeah, I know we can.

279
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,080
你那邊如何

還剩八個
Eight more!

281
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,760
你呢
How about you?

282
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,810
十個

283
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,330
瑞克

284
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,430
瑞克
Rick!

285
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,630
米瓊恩
Michonne!

286
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,160
我試過了  但我還欠你一頭
I tried, but I still owe you one.

287
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,140
我可以在外面多待幾天
I could've gone a couple more days.

288
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,840
我喜歡那樣
I would've liked that.

289
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,540
我一直沒睡
I haven't been sleeping.

290
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,260
想著我們失去了什么
Thinking about what we lost.

291
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,910
想著我的朋友們
Thinking about my friends.

292
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,440
格倫救過我
Glenn saved me.

293
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,220
在最開始的時候
Right at the start.

294
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,880
而我沒能救他
I couldn't save him.

295
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,690
這很正常
It's normal.

296
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,150
我知道
I know that.

297
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,010
無法釋懷
Being stuck on it.

298
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,360
我們經歷了一些事
We went through something.

299
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,730
光這樣是不能釋懷的
This -- This doesn't cure it.

300
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,200
瑞克  我很抱歉
Rick, I'm sorry.

301
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,100
我們要反抗他們

302
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,350
這就是接下來會發生的事
That's what happens next.

303
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,870
我們會失去一些人
And we're gonna lose people,

304
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,760
也許是很多人  也許是對方
maybe a lot of them, maybe even each other.

305
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,000
即使那樣  也值得
Even then, it'll be worth it.

306
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,600
當我想到...
When I thought that...

307
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,660
我不能失去你
I can't lose you.

308
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,660
你問過我
You asked me

309
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,020
放棄算怎么個活法
what kind of life we had just surrendering.

310
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,620
那不是生活
It wasn't -- It wasn't a life.

311
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,290
我們在那里做的事
What we did back there,

312
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,240
我們現在做的事
what we're doing now,

313
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,220
為朱迪思拼未來
making a future for Judith

314
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,820
為格倫和瑪姬的孩子拼未來
and for Glenn and Maggie's baby,

315
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,150
做出抗爭  這才叫生活
fighting the fight, that's living.

316
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,150
這是你讓我知道的
You showed me that.

317
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,520

我們可以失去朋友  愛的人

321
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,440
這不再是關乎我們了
It's not about us anymore.

322
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,190
是關乎未來
It's about a future.

323
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,540
如果我沒能活下來
And if it's me who doesn't make it,

324
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,720
你就必須帶領其他人前行
you're gonna have to lead the others forward

325
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,340
因為你有這能力
because you're the one who can.

326
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,750
但是
But...

327
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,540
你怎么知道
how do you know?

328
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,220
因為
Because...

329
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,420
你帶我走到了這里
you led me here.

330
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,160
全都能用嗎
Operational? All?

331

據我說知能

可能需要清理一下  我們找到了物資

要我們清理嗎

我們清理了一部分  上了油

剩下的你們來  我們是合作關系

336
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,820
好的  但能用嗎
Yes, yes, but operational?

337
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,120
你可以開幾槍試試  如果你想的話

341
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,620
你是說不要清單嗎

342
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,240
-不夠  -你說什么
- Not enough. ?What? - Wha-- ?What are you talking about?

343
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,600
你要很多槍  這就是很多槍
You asked for a lot of guns. That's what this is.

344
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,000
要為你戰斗  我們需要兩倍的槍
Enough to fight your fight. Us? Nearly twice.

345
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,370
需要兩倍的槍

槍是我們的  協議還沒結束
Our guns to take. Our deal still on.

00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,080
你們不能全拿
Not all of them.

351
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,520
我們留十把  為了找更多的槍
We're keeping 10 for ourselves -- to find more.

盡快拿來更多槍  我們就戰斗

361
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,790
再多等幾天
You get a few more days

362
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,040
"接下來的事"就會發生
before "What happens next."

363
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,600
再多等幾天
Few more days?

364
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,750
沒錯
That's right.

365
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,690
我們會找到更多槍  想辦法解決
We'll find more, figure it out.

你見到羅西塔了嗎
Have you seen Rosita?

372
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,930
今早換崗她不在
She didn't show for her guard shift this morning.

373
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,490
她大概出去找槍了吧
She probably just went out looking for more.

374
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,220
好吧
Mm. Yeah.

375
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,780
你為什么...
Why were you --

376
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,700
你為什么找我
Why were you coming by?

377

我要告訴你一些事

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,800
你來這里是...
Are you here --

379
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,480
我來這里是找你幫忙的
I'm here because I need your help.

380
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,150
有一個條件
One condition --

381
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,320
要由我殺他
I get to take the shot.

382
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,600
好
Okay.

383
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,410
你帶橋上的炸藥了嗎
Did you bring any explosives from the bridge?

384
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,410
我考慮過
I thought about it.

385
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,990
但我不想被別人發現和阻止
But I didn't want anyone finding out and trying to stop me.

386
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,110
我帶了更好的東西
I got something better, though.

387
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,290
這樣你就能殺他了
So you can take your shot.

388
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,310
瑞克和米瓊恩找到了槍
Rick and Michonne found guns.

389
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,440
但他們沒準備好行動
But they aren't ready to move.

390
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,600
他們不能
They can't.

391
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,570
她們需要更多槍  更多人  更多時間
The need more guns, more people, more time,

392
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,790
更多借口
more excuses.

393
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,480
我記下了達里爾和卡爾給瑞克說的
I memorized everything Daryl and Carl told Rick

394
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,040
尼根基地內部情況
about the inside of Negan's place.

395
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,820
耶穌給我畫了一張外圍的地圖
Jesus made me a map of the outside.

396
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,830
非常遠  守衛森嚴
It's far away. It's well-defended.

397
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,150
-只有我們兩個人  -你要改主意嗎
There's only two of us. You changing your mind?

398
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,700
我準備好殺他了
I'm ready to kill him.

399
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,860
但我要確認你知道這意味著什么
But I need to make sure you know what this means.

400
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,040
你知道嗎
Do you?

401
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,960
他們不能活捉我們
They can't catch us alive.

402
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,810
如果被抓住  就給了他們借口
If they do, we give them something.

403
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,600
我們這是有去無回
It's a one-way ticket for both of us.

404
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,970
假如我們都去的話
If it is both of us.

405
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,380
我們都去
It is.
