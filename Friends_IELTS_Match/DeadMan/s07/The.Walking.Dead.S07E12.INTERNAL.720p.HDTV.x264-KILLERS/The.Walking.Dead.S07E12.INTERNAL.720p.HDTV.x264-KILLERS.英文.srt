1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,600
Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead"...

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,750
We are the ones who get things done.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,540
We can find a way to beat them.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,430
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,260
The least you can tell is where not to look.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,290
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,500
Sure thing.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,190
Don't do this.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,170
We need to wait for the right moment.

10
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,070
Guns.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,080
A lot.

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,600
And then we fight your fight.

13
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,990
Yes.

14
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,310
We have a deal.

15
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,350
Thanks for keeping watch last night.

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,740
Oh, it's nothing. I like it.

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,330
Uh, you can keep watch tonight.

18
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,610
We gonna win today?

19
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,680
Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,990
We're gonna need batteries for that walkie, too.

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,760
Get it working again.

22
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,620
What is it? What's that smile?

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,060
Couple of days out, all we got to show are

24
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,800
two guns, dented cans of beans,

25
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,930
and some football jerseys, pretty much.

26
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,920
Pretty much.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,010
We're fightin' the fight.

28
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,640
It's better.

29
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,600
Good morning.

30
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,100
And if I hear one more goddamn word about Fat Joey,

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
I'm gonna smash somebody's teeth in.

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,780
Good riddance to dead weight.

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,440
No more mascot crap.

34
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,980
They got good taste in pretzels.

35
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,170
And batteries.

36
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,810
Two days. We're gonna need to get back.

37
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,780
Rick...

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
Day and a half more -- today and tomorrow.

39
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,590
We can come out again. We should get back.

40
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,780
Just a little more.

41
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,450
We're okay.

42
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,670
We don't have to find them right now.

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,240
Yeah, I know.

44
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,080
Just a little more, okay?

45
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
Okay.

46
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,430

Denise showed me how.

58
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm done.

59
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,240
What?

60
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,750
Nothing.

61
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,500
Okay.

62
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,980
It's gonna work out.

63
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,220
What -- What does that even mean, Tara?

64
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,340
It means we've got the numbers to fight now.

65
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,950
We just need to find some guns and --

66
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,220
Do you know where we could find that many guns today?

67
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,780
This week? This year?

68
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,390
No. You don't.

69
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,670
I can't just wait.

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,750
I don't know about you, but I can't.

71
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,430
We're gonna find the guns, okay? And we're gonna fight.

72
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,030
Look, it's not gonna be easy.

73
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,410
It wasn't the last time at the outpost.

74
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,070
Hey, maybe you could just save all this for them.

75
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,790
Here.

76
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,400
It'll help with your scar.

77
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,910
Keep it.

78
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,090
We need guns.

79
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm gonna go find them.

80
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,530
Damn it.

81
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,670
What was it?

82
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,080
It was a deer.

83
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,250
I owe you a deer.

84
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,050
From before.

85
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,370
When they were outside the gate.

86
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, yeah, you do.

87
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,260
You see that?

88
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,940
Yeah.

89
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,200
It's guns like that. That's why we're out here.

90
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,080
Something serious happened here.

91
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,170
A long time ago.

92
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,460
Yeah. These are serious rounds.

93
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,100
Might be serious guns here, too.

94
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,480
Let's get a better look.

95
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,540
Yeah.

96
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,820
Damn it.

97
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,550
Watch your step.

98
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,940
Maybe we shouldn't be up here too long.

99
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,090
Well, let's see what we're gonna see.

100
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,090
Soldiers, civilians, all those rounds --

101
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,630
There was a fight.

102
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,700
Maybe it was the walkers.

103
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,040
Maybe just other people.

104
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,860
They're still wearing their guns.

105
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,060
I think this is it.

106
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,990
I think it is, too.

107
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,180
Think we can?

108
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,630
Yeah, we can.

109
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,560
Are you okay?

110
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Y-Yeah. Are you?

111
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,550
I am. ?

112
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,200
This is -- This is a sign, right?

113
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,720
This is it. It has to be.

114
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,590
Oh-ho. It is.

115
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,120
Well, they're ready.

116
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,320
Let's eat.

117
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,110
I didn't find any guns.

118
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,910
In case you were wondering.

119
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,820
I was out there all day and not a damn one.

120
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,720
Not a real one.

121
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,870
Thing is, I had a gun.

122
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,420
I was gonna use it to kill Negan.

123
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,830
I was ready to.

124
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,980
And if I had done it, like I'd planned to,

125
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,930
Negan would be dead right now.

126
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,390
And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead, too, but who gives a damn?

127
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,680
Eugene would still be here.

128
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,330
Olivia would still be alive.

129
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,330
Spencer would still be alive.

130
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,970
And now they're gone, and I'm here

131
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,660
because I was stupid enough to listen to you.

132
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,380
But you were.

133
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,640
And you did.

134
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,220
You stand there telling people about their lives.

135
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,500
Only if they come here.

136
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,660
Like you.

137
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,740
Right now.

138
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,680
You don't know shit about shit.

139
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,690
You're right.

140
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,260
I don't.

141
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,250
I said that you weren't supposed to die

142
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,820
and that you shouldn't do the thing that you were planning to do

143
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,220
because we needed you --

144
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,930
still do.

145
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,300
Even a fool like me could see that.

146
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,400
It's easier to be dead,

147
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,850
and if it's my fault you're alive,

148
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,720
well, I'm just gonna have to live with that.

149
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,150
I decided to meddle.

150
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,110
But I did something I thought was right,

151
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,450
and I knew the stakes were very high.

152
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,090
You can certainly blame me for the fact that you have a life,

153
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,020
but after that what are you going to do with it?

154
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,150
How are you going to make what needs to happen happen?

155
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,370
Anything is possible until your heart stops beating.

156
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,940
Certainly more than yelling at a fool.

157
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
What?

158
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,420
How is it?

159
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,350
It's good.

160
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,410
So, tomorrow...

161
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,710
we go out there, we get the weapons, right?

162
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,390
We get Jadis and her people to fight with us.

163
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,700
We kill Negan

164
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,720
and anyone else we have to to win.

165
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,960
And what happens after that?

166
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,220
After that, we keep going.

167
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,070
Yeah, but...

168
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,130
Negan ordered the world his way.

169
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,620
It's up to us to reorder it once he's gone, right?

170
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,880
All the different communities,

171
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,810
they can figure it out together, how to keep going together.

172
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,080
Yeah, but somebody's gonna have to make that happen.

173
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,740
Somebody will need to be in charge of that, right?

174
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,900
It should be you.

175
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,570
- Not me. - ?Why not?

176
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,740
You could do it.

177
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,490
?You'd be good at it.

178
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,870
I mean, if it's something that you wanted.

179
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,650
Well, I don't think I do. Or I would.

180
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,230
But the two of us, you and me,

181
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,070
reordering things together...

182
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,470
I want that.

183
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,290
If it's something you wanted....

184
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,070
Yeah.

185
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,940
I'm gonna eat five more of these dinners, okay?

186
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,120
You know...

187
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,150
we don't have to get it done tomorrow.

188
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,250
We can take our time.

189
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,960
If we go another day, another one after that, it's fine.

190
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,850
I mean, the place is clear.

191
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,010
It's locked up tight.

192
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,330
We found the only way in, so...

193
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,750
We should get back.

194
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
If we're getting the guns,

195
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,900
it doesn't matter if it takes a little longer.

196
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,420
Wait. I've been, um...

197
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,890
I've been waiting to show you this one.

198
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,260
It's, um, chili and mac and cheese...

199
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,410
together.

200
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
Come on.

201
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,360
Oh. Sorry.

202
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,850
I was just thinking.

203
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,660
W..you...you want this?

204
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,400
Congrats.

205
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,940
It's yours.

206
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,870
Someone gave it to me, someone who helped me.

207
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,390
She put her ass on the line for me.

208
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,320
She saved my life, you know?

209
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,330
She didn't have to. But she did.

210
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,080
That means something now -- it does. It has to.

211
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,580
If I say something, you know --

212
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,740
Rick won't leave there without their guns.

213
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,350
If -- if we could even get close enough,

214
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,300
they'll start firing, and we'll fire back.

215
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,510
I mean, they should just fight with us.

216
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,860
The Saviors killed their fathers

217
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,760
and their sons and their brothers.

218
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,910
They won't want to fight with us.

219
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,200
They just want to hide.

220
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,640
So they'll just fight us.

221
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,350
I tell everyone about Oceanside, that's what happens.

222
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,200
What makes our life worth more than theirs?

223
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,950
Because we want to stop

224
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,480
the people that are hurting us,

225
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,250
who will hurt other people?

226
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,980
God damn it.

227
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,610
Look.

228
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,050
The walkers in the field, they're not closed in.

229
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,700
Yeah.

230
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,540
We got to take care of the ones out here

231
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,230
and block that gap, too, so we can take the rest slow.

232
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,280
Seven, eight...

233
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,870
nine...

234
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,870
That car -- I can block it up.

235
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,460
I can take out that one on the way.

236
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,650
You draw the rest.

237
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,350
You're leaving me eight.

238
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,120
We could shoot them,

239
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,890
but that would call the rest from the field.

240
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,480
This is about doing it quiet, with the sword.

241
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,300
You can handle eight.

242
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,040
You got your eight walkers. I can push.

243
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,550
So can I.

244
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,240
You just worry about steering us in that gap.

245
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,360
?Shit.

246
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,850
The brakes don't work.

247
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,230
Michonne, you good?

248
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
Yeah.

249
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,910
You?

250
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,560
Yeah.

251
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,100
I think we overshot it.

252
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,950
You think or you know?

253
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,310
I know.

254
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,060
It was a good plan, though.

255
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,770
It was a great plan.

256
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,030
We'll do it here.

257
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,950
Yeah.

258
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,900
Shit. It's not gonna hold.

259
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,470
There it goes!

260
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,500
Split them off into smaller groups.

261
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,440
The barriers might hold.

262
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,910
You take slide, I take Ferris wheel?

263
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,500
Or we could just go.

264
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,190
- You want to go? ?- Nah. We can do this.

265
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,500
Yeah, I know we can.

266
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,080
How you doing?!

267
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,860
Eight more!

268
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,760
How about you?

269
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,810
10!

270
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,330
Rick!

271
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,430
Rick!

272
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,630
Michonne!

273
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,160
I tried, but I still owe you one.

274
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,140
I could've gone a couple more days.

275
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,840
I would've liked that.

276
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,540
I haven't been sleeping.

277
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,260
Thinking about what we lost.

278
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,910
Thinking about my friends.

279
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,440
Glenn saved me.

280
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,220
Right at the start.

281
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,880
I couldn't save him.

282
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,690
It's normal.

283
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,150
I know that.

284
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,010
Being stuck on it.

285
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,360
We went through something.

286
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,730
This -- This doesn't cure it.

287
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,200
Rick, I'm sorry.

288
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,100
We're gonna fight them.

289
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,350
That's what happens next.

290
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,870
And we're gonna lose people,

291
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,760
maybe a lot of them, maybe even each other.

292
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,000
Even then, it'll be worth it.

293
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,600
When I thought that...

294
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,660
I can't lose you.

295
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,660
You asked me

296
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,020
what kind of life we had just surrendering.

297
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,620
It wasn't -- It wasn't a life.

298
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,290
What we did back there,

299
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,240
what we're doing now,

300
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,220
making a future for Judith

301
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,820
and for Glenn and Maggie's baby,

302
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,150
fighting the fight, that's living.

303
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,150
You showed me that.

304
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,520
You can lose me.

305
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,350
- No. - ?Yes, you can.

306
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,260
I can lose you. ?

307
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,410
We can lose our friends, people we love.

308
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,440
It's not about us anymore.

309
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,190
It's about a future.

310
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,540
And if it's me who doesn't make it,

311
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,720
you're gonna have to lead the others forward

312
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,340
because you're the one who can.

313
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,750
But...

314
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,540
how do you know?

315
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,220
Because...

316
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,420
you led me here.

317
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,160
Operational? All?

318
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,630
To the best of my knowledge, yeah.

319
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,210
May need some cleaning. We found supplies.

320
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,500
Expect us?

321
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,120
We cleaned some. We oiled some.

322
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,330
You can do the rest. We do this together.

323
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,820
Yes, yes, but operational?

324
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,120
Well, you can fire a few. Try them out, if you like.

325
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,730
- How many? - 63.

326
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,190
We made an inventory.

327
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,690
No.

328
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,620
You mean the inventory?

329
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,240
- Not enough. ?What? - Wha-- ?What are you talking about?

330
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,600
You asked for a lot of guns. That's what this is.

331
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,000
Enough to fight your fight. Us? Nearly twice.

332
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,370
Need nearly twice.

333
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,640
We've wasted enough time.

334
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,030
Let's go. Take our guns with us.

335
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,050
No.

336
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,790
Our guns to take. Our deal still on.

337
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,080
Not all of them.

338
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,520
We're keeping 10 for ourselves -- to find more.

339
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,040
Five.

340
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,200
10. ?6.

341
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,670
10. ?9.

342
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,770
And the cat back.

343
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,540
20. I keep the cat.

344
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,130
We get you the guns. We fight together.

345
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,060
Say yes.

346
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,650
Yes.

347
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,330
More soon, we'll fight.

348
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,790
You get a few more days

349
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,040
before "What happens next."

350
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,600
Few more days?

351
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,750
That's right.

352
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,690
We'll find more, figure it out.

353
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,980
Soon.

354
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,620
In a few more days.

355
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,020
You all right?

356
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,350
Yeah, yeah, I was just -- I was just coming over to see you.

357
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,300
What's up?

358
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,230
Have you seen Rosita?

359
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,930
She didn't show for her guard shift this morning.

360
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,490
She probably just went out looking for more.

361
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,220
Mm. Yeah.

362
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,780
Why were you --

363
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,700
Why were you coming by?

364
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,180
I have something to tell you.

365
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,800
Are you here --

366
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm here because I need your help.

367
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,150
One condition --

368
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,320
I get to take the shot.

369
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,600
Okay.

370
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,410
Did you bring any explosives from the bridge?

371
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,410
I thought about it.

372
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,990
But I didn't want anyone finding out and trying to stop me.

373
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,110
I got something better, though.

374
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,290
So you can take your shot.

375
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,310
Rick and Michonne found guns.

376
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,440
But they aren't ready to move.

377
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,600
They can't.

378
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,570
The need more guns, more people, more time,

379
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,790
more excuses.

380
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,480
I memorized everything Daryl and Carl told Rick

381
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,040
about the inside of Negan's place.

382
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,820
Jesus made me a map of the outside.

383
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,830
It's far away. It's well-defended.

384
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,150
There's only two of us. You changing your mind?

385
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,700
I'm ready to kill him.

386
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,860
But I need to make sure you know what this means.

387
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,040
Do you?

388
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,960
They can't catch us alive.

389
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,810
If they do, we give them something.

390
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,600
It's a one-way ticket for both of us.

391
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,970
If it is both of us.

392
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,380
It is.
