1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,560
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead".

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,530
Get up. We're breaking you out.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,860
I'm not going with you.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,190
It's not your time.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,660
Somebody opened the door for him.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,000
We decided to protect ourselves no matter what.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,370
We would stay hidden, and we would stay alive.

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,370
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,830
At least you can tell us where not to look.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,630
Yeah, sure thing.

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,990
They -- They have guns.

12
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,570
A lot of them.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,560
I saw it.

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,740
What?

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,880
That group.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,220
Um, the women I met.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,880
They have an armory. They have guns.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,600
Why didn't you tell us before now?

19
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,400
I made a promise, Rick.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,530
Do you ever think about who you've killed?

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,250
Yeah.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,530
Are you ready if this goes south?

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,990
It won't.

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,950
If it does, you don't need to feel bad.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,330
I do feel bad.

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,210
I will.

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,990
Tara...

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,410
you don't have to.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,410
You need ?to cover this with a tarp.

30
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,800
- A tarp? ?- Tarp.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,310
Why?

32
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,910
Think about it.

33
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,800
Okay. Just tell me.

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,860
We want warmth

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,470
so they'll put out shoots before the last freeze.

36
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,710
That way, we pull back the tarp,

37
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,890
they die naturally,

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,610
saves on all the endless weeding.

39
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,410
Get to tarping.

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,390
You got it, boss lady.

41
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,790
Uh, wait. Where are you going?

42
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,800
I, uh -- I'm not a farmer.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
I need some help here.

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,430
No, you don't.

45
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,290
I saw a wild blueberry bush growing outside.

46
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,180
If it's young enough,

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,980
I'm gonna pull it up and replant it here.

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,550
Good one will produce for over 40 years.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,050
We got to start acting like we'll be around that long.

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,690
Cool. Yeah.

51
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,380
Just tarp. Don't touch.

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,090
I'll see how you do after.

Once you're up, watch for the signal.

63
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,380
What time does the clock start?

64
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,470
Soon as she's in.

65
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,990
You good?

66
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,460
I'm good enough.

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,070
I'm glad you came. I know it's been hard.

68
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,670
- I know you don't want this. - Didn't want this,

69
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,810
but I'm starting to understand what's on the menu now.

70
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,030
We can hide like these people,

71
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,980
we can keep trying to serve The Saviors,

72
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,920
and I can watch you get randomly beaten every so often,

73
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,070
or else we can fight.

74
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,140
So, here we are.

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,700
And being with you, well...

76
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,420
it makes abject terror tolerable.

77
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,190
I should've tried harder to stop Rosita and Sasha.

78
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,950
If they'd have just waited one more day...

79
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,160
Well, Sasha's a good shot,

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,930
and Rosita knows how to take care of herself.

81
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,800
Probably back at Hilltop right now.

82
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,670
Least I hope so. We're gonna need 'em.

83
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,790
There's a whole lot of people still got to die.

84
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,730
Hey, there.

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,150
You okay?

86
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,240
Can I get some water?

87
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,830
I should introduce myself.

88
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,750
I'm David.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,950
I wonder if you remember me from last night.

90
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,900
Do you?

91
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,640
No.

92
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,150
Well, I can forgive that.

93
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,260
Last night was kind of a shitstorm.

94
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,500
I was the guy that gave the rope to the guys that tied you up.

95
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,550
I always keep some close.

96
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,320
There's just all kinds of fun and interesting things you can do with rope.

97
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,040
God, you're pretty.

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,890
If I give you some water,

99
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,280
which is not something I'm supposed to do,

100
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,530
will you do something for me?

101
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,050
Something you're not supposed to do?

102
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,780
Will you?

103
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,690
Tell me how thirsty you are.

104
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,500
Go to hell.

105
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,890
Oh, shit.

106
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,040
Fighting's just gonna make it last longer.

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Which, for the record, is fine by me.

108
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,890
?David!

109
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,510
What the hell are you doing in here?

110
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,330
Negan, sir --

111
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,990
Do you really think I need you to answer that?

112
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,210
I can see that you're trying to rape this woman.

113
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,780
You were trying to rape this woman, weren't you?

114
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,460
This is some unacceptable behavior.

115
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,370
Rape is against the rules here.

116
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,520
I wouldn't wanna be somewhere where it wasn't.

117
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,910
Someone in charge who let something like that fly...

118
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,810
David.

119
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,140
You really crossed a line here.

120
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,430
I'm sorry, sir.

121
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,230
You know what?

122
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,780
I do not accept your apology.

123
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,510
Get, uh...

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,680
Sasha.

125
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,620
That is a beautiful name.

126
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,920
Get Sasha here a new T-shirt.

127
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm sorry you had to see that.

128
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,740
Sorry 'bout the rope, too.

129
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,050
Probably overkill,

130
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,370
but you did cause one hell of a fracas last night.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,750
Oh, shit.

132
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,620
I remember you.

133
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,220
Yeah.

134
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,120
You were there.

135
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,670
Oh, hell. I get it now.

136
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,930
I got to hand it to you.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,070
You've got some beach-ball-sized lady nuts on you,

138
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,410
coming in all kamikaze like that.

139
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,100
Big question here,

140
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,860
and I need the truth on this one --

141
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,260
Did Rick put you up to this?

142
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,830
Rick?

143
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,310
Your bitch?

144
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,200
No.

145
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,980
Either way, you must've thought it was gonna be the end,

146
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,350
coming in on your lonesome like that.

147
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,120
But that's not the way it's got to go.

148
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,190
Unh-unh. Just the opposite.

149
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,550
See, this...

150
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,290
Well, this could be the beginning.

151
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,110
This knife is yours now.

152
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,520
You can try to use it, take me out,

153
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,540
but considering I am standing above you,

154
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,600
holding a baseball bat,

155
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,680
that doesn't seem real smart.

156
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,460
Now, you can use it to slit your wrists,

157
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,380
which would be a damn shame, but I get it.

158
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,270
You're obviously not on the shiny side of the street,

159
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,020
given recent events.

160
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,620
Now, you can sit there and do nothin',

161
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,990
wait for ol' David to come back to life and eat your face,

162
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,350
also a damn shame and kinda nuts,

163
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,550
but, hell, to each their own.

164
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:16,480
Or you can use that blade and stop ol' Rapey David

165
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,520
from becoming Dead-Alive Rapey David,

166
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,070
save yourself, join the cause.

167
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,050
I know what I'd do.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,010
What?

169
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,040
I'm a man short.

170
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,350
Hell, you can't really call this piece of shit a man,

171
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,640
but still, I'm short,

172
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,770
and you got those beach-ball-sized lady nuts,

173
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,000
and I wanna harness the heat comin' off of 'em.

174
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,820
You can help me run this place one day,

175
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,950
all of us together, following the rules,

176
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,020
workin' on the same side of things.

177
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,470
That's all this was ever about.

178
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,480
And it still can be for you.

179
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,620
I know it's hard to picture,

180
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,740
considering what I did.

181
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,400
But, Sasha, we all got shit to get over.

182
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,990
Take some time. Think about it.

183
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,930
Whatever you decide, so it shall be.

184
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,280
No pressure.

185
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,360
And, again, I am sorry you had to see that,

186
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,690
even though I know you have seen some things.

187
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,220
I just want you to understand...

188
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,060
we are not monsters.

189
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,490
What did they do to you?

190
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,660
They're keepin' me safe.

191
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,430
I brought you some creature comforts.

192
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,090
Full disclosure, the pillow is not hypoallergenic.

193
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,320
There was some debate as to whether or not I should come in here.

194
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,560
They said in the event of a hostage situation with the pig sticker

195
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,410
that I would fully be on my own.

196
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,180
Just wanted to share that.

197
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,610
Negan relayed to me his offer to you.

198
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,680
It's my opinion that you should accept said offer,

199
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,000
just as I did.

200
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,520
I know it's a hold-your-nose situation,

201
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,080
but taking up with the management here

202
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,110
was indeed the correct select.

203
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
You know, I believed I could be brave,

204
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,600
that I could be a survivor like Abraham was,and ...

205
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,990
ridin' that RV into the sunset was...

206
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,480
some of the greatest 37 minutes of my existence.

207
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,730
But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.

208
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,190
I have never in my life been as scared

209
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,010
as I was that night in the woods,

210
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,250
kit to the grit,

211
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,400
fully believing my number's about to be called,

212
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,040
then seeing it happen to someone brave...

213
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,880
to a survivor.

214
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,160
And then the pants-pissing terror

215
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,760
of the rinse and repeat of that very same event --

216
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,630
I just...

217
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,800
I couldn't.

218
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,080
Being here means I'll never have to again.

219
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,200
And neither will you if you just say "yes."

220
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,370
Please say "yes."

221
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,500
He would want you to.

222
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,040
He wouldn't.

223
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,320
I do.

224
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,310
We're still here.

225
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,340
Things have changed.

226
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,570
We can change with 'em. We have to.

227
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,290
Go.

228
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,780
- He's, uh, starting to... - Please.

229
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,600
Go.

230
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,730
Don't think I've seen you outside the walls.

231
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,020
Well, I built these walls to use them.

232
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,150
If I want greenery, I eat a salad.

233
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,680
Then why are you here?

234
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,490
I was hoping we could talk.

235
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,310
Then I saw you come out here alone.

236
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,100
I was concerned.

237
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,870
Where are your friends?

238
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,890
They went out.

239
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,100
They're looking for something they need.

240
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,310
Without you?

241
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,240
Now, I'm just wondering -- Why you still here, Maggie?

242
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,990
With Carson gone...

243
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,820
I heard you were gonna get him back.

244
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,820
That not true?

245
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,400
Was it just something you said?

246
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,920
Maggie, you've got to start trusting me.

247
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,180
You know, people are tense, they're worried.

248
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,530
Everybody'd be a hell of a lot better

249
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,100
if we could present a-a united front.

250
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,440
It would be a lot easier if we actually were a united front.

251
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,400
You're right.

252
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,660
I need to be more open to working together.

253
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,200
I apologize.

254
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,470
I never intended for things between us to come to this point.

255
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,210
I appreciate that.

256
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,620
It's never too late to change. You know that?

257
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,870
If you're serious, I'll come by later and we can talk more.

258
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,310
Fine.

259
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,510
Great.

260
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,240
I thought this'd just take a second.

261
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Would you mind keeping an eye out while I finish up?

262
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,180
Could you do that?

263
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,860
Happy to.

264
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,320
We got one.

265
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,450
I'll do it.

266
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,110
I'm here to protect the pregnant lady.

267
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,200
Don't need the pregnant lady to protect me.

268
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,540
Have you ever killed one before?

269
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,380
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

270
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,410
- It's fine. I got it. - No.

271
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,300
Jesus.

272
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,300
Fine. Do it.

273
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,950
Maggie!

274
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,940
Please help me!

275
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,330
You okay?

276
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,500
He hasn't killed one before.

277
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,080
He's learning.

278
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,100
That's not what he told us.

279
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,800
Thanks for the help.

280
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,200
You catch that yourself?

281
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,490
- Shit, yeah. - ?Rachel.

282
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,110
I mean, yeah.

283
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,110
- Gonna go clean it. - Okay.

284
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,890
Stay quiet

285
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,060
and put your hands on your head.

286
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,840
We should've just killed you in the village.

287
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,110
You're gonna be glad you didn't.

288
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,890
You're not alone, are you?

289
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,960
Sit.

290
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,480
What do you want?

291
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,800
I want you to sit.

292
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,230
Hey, Cyndie.

293
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,590
You promised.

294
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,550
Yeah. I did.

295
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,950
Put your hands on your head.

296
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,360
I didn't have a choice.

297
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,760
Why are you here?

298
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,930
I said I didn't have a choice.

299
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,250
But you do, both of you do.

300
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,350
My friends are out there right now,

301
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,670
and they're gonna take this place, hopefully without firing a shot.

302
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,170
What? You're...you're gonna "Take this place"?

303
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,320
What are you talking about?

304
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,750
We need your guns.

305
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,750
What?

306
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,330
We're gonna fight The Saviors.

307
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,980
- You should join us. ?- No.

308
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,810
The Saviors killed your fathers,

309
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,980
your brothers, husbands, sons, and you ran from them.

310
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,320
I thought we got rid of them.

311
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,560
Beatrice said there was more out there, and she was right.

312
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,710
They came back.

313
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,260
They killed my friends.

314
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,490
They killed my girlfriend.

315
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,510
They took us over. They took everything from us.

316
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,310
We do whatever The Saviors tell us to do,

317
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,160
and they think we're still doing that, but we're not.

318
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,580
We're gonna fight them.

319
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,530
And we have other communities beside us,

320
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,960
and with Oceanside, we would have an army.

321
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,550
So, that's it?

322
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,280
"Thanks for the guns. You should join us"?

323
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,270
If we fight them together, we can beat them.

324
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,260
We have to try.

325
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,260
They'll win, Tara. I've seen it. So have you.

326
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,590
Just talk to the leader of my group, Rick.

327
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,360
Just talk, and we don't have to take over this place.

328
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,410
We don't want to.

329
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,930
I can give them the signal to stop this,

330
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,440
but you have to tell me right now.

331
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,030
Listen. We're not just hiding in the woods.

332
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,170
We're doing something. We're not giving up.

333
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,320
I didn't want to break my promise, Cyndie, okay?

334
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,680
But the world can belong to good people, to fair people,

335
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,850
if we're all just brave enough to try.

336
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,420
We are not good, and we are not brave.

337
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,010
Neither you nor me.

338
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,200
She is.

339
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,970
That's why we're in this mess.

340
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,610
Look, Tara, if you take our guns,

341
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,190
you might as well be killing us all.

342
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,720
That's what you'll be doing.

343
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,330
We should talk to them.

344
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,510
No.

345
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,290
We can try to stop this.

346
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,710
No, Cyndie.

347
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,190
It doesn't matter.

348
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,860
You can't.

349
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,950
Go! Go!

350
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,880
The arsenal!

351
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,590
On the ground. Now.

352
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,400
Those hands -- Put them on your head.

353
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Please.

354
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,860
Your people killing my people?

355
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,760
The bombs were outside the walls.

356
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,470
You could've stopped this.

357
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,390
Look, I hope everyone is okay. I do.

358
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,620
They better be.

359
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,480
Stand up.

360
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,850
It's time to move.

361
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,350
It's my legs.

362
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,100
Stop, stop. Back up. Back up.

363
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,400
Cyndie, stop!

364
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,420
It's empty. ?What?

365
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,650
It's unloaded.

366
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,860
We didn't come here to hurt anybody.

367
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,140
Cyndie, give it here.

368
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,910
Now.

369
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,090
Natania, just talk to Rick.

370
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,600
Shut up.

371
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,110
Everybody down!

372
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,340
Hands on your heads.

373
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,580
Everybody stay calm.

374
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,090
We don't want anyone to get hurt.

375
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,000
Stay down and listen to what we say.

376
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,720
We want this to go as simply and as peacefully as possible.

377
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,500
All of you can make it that way.

378
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,130
Get down over there. Keep quiet.

379
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,040
Now, we made a lot of noise.

380
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,540
We want to wrap this up quick so you can send people

381
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,010
to redirect anything coming this way.

382
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,620
Tara said your forests are relatively clear,

383
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,270
so we won't take any chances.

384
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,400
No one needs to get hurt.

385
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,020
This is just about what you have, what we need.

386
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,610
Nobody's taking anything.

387
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,940
You need to let everyone go

388
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,230
and leave right now.

389
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,380
Just walk away or this one dies.

390
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,460
Yeah, we'll leave you alone.

391
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,040
But we're taking your weapons with us.

392
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,850
That's not gonna change.

393
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,660
It's Natania, right?

394
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,730
Put the gun down,

395
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,680
and let's talk about what we can change.

396
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,060
No. Leave right now.

397
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,550
Michonne, don't!

398
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,470
We just wanna be left alone.

399
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,070
Yeah, we'll leave you alone.

400
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,480
Just let go of her. Now.

401
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,760
Or we'll kill you.

402
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,640
None of us want that.

403
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,850
They want us to fight The Saviors.

404
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,020
We tried that. We lost. Too much.

405
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,650
We're not gonna lose anymore --

406
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,040
not our guns, not our safety,

407
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,140
not after everything we've done to get here.

408
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,450
We're gonna win --

409
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,640
with your guns, with or without your help.

410
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,510
Natania, put the gun down.

411
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,940
You kill me, and you die.

412
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,540
And my people take the guns and nothing changes.

413
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,840
Maybe we should try.

414
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,330
Grandma, stop.

415
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,060
It's over.

416
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,350
Just talk to them, okay?

417
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,090
It's not over!

418
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,340
They've forgotten.

419
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,690
You've all forgotten.

420
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,500
Some of you actually want to fight them?

421
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,010
After everything?

422
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,080
We can lose our guns,

423
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,360
but us leaving this place to fight?

424
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,840
After everything?

425
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,830
I have to remind you!

426
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,710
Yes.

427
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,760
I am gonna do this, and then I'm gonna die.

428
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
But it's that important.

429
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,400
This is your life, all of you.

430
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,510
Remember what it looks like.

431
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,480
Remember what they did to us!

432
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,300
You need to see this. Open your eyes!

433
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,240
Rick! Walkers!

434
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,590
Everybody up!

435
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,200
Get the children behind us!

436
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
They're coming.

437
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,730
First shift, join them on the line.

438
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,040
Knives out. Dead only. Dead only!

439
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,800
Don't go anywhere.

440
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,470
Everyone, shots within 10 feet of the line.

441
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,790
That's it.

442
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,910
Now!

443
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,500
No. We're not fighting them with you.

444
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,700
So take your damn guns and go.

445
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,540
You win.

446
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,920
No.

447
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,800
You win.

448
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,040
Get some people in here. Clean this up.

449
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,110
What?

450
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,710
You didn't actually think

451
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,400
I was gonna let you keep this, did you?

452
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,430
You still got a ways to go

453
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,730
before I'll believe you're fully on board here.

454
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,150
Baby steps.

455
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,610
It is absolutely not personal.

456
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,900
If the situation was reversed,

457
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm sure you wouldn't believe me, either.

458
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,450
Still...

459
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,810
the way you saved yourself,

460
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,190
the way you surrendered to me just now --

461
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,490
That is a damn good start.

462
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,870
But we got to work on some things, Sasha.

463
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,120
But I promise you, I will try to make it fun.

464
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,020
Cards on the table...

465
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,310
a little birdie told me

466
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,620
that Rick and the rest of your people are up to no good.

467
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,530
And, well, that needs to change,

468
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,890
and you're gonna help me change it.

469
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,370
We're gonna find us a win-win.

470
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,750
How?

471
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,140
- What are you - Hey, I'm gonna get you some stuff

472
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,490
to make you more comfortable,

473
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,720
let you have a taste of what it is we have to offer.

474
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,170
Spend the night enjoying it,

475
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,040
'cause tomorrow...

476
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,110
is gonna be a big day.

477
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,470
Kal!

478
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,540
Yeah?

479
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm gonna need you to drive me somewhere.

480
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,530
You're gonna want to pack a bag.

481
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,300
Hello?

482
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,300
It's Eugene.

483
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,410
Word in the halls is that you're all-in with things here.

484
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,880
It may not seem like it now,

485
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,260
but I assure you,

486
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,100
you, too, made the correct select.

487
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,800
I was wrong.

488
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,830
I can't.

489
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,440
I won't.

490
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,580
I've been sitting here,

491
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,430
trying to figure out how I could,

492
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,280
with what happened,

493
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,740
with our friends still out there,

494
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,650
still being hurt by them.

495
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,650
I don't know how I could've said that.

496
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,620
And now...I am trapped.

497
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,440
You have to help me.

498
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,610
I will.

499
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,810
I'll help you get used to the idea

500
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,310
and illustrate the equation and demonstrate why --

501
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,780
It was a mistake.

502
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,650
I was ready.

503
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,220
I knew, if I didn't kill him last night,

504
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,490
it'd be over.

505
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,520
And I didn't, so it is.

506
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,960
It has to be.

507
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,580
You have to get me something --

508
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,580
a knife, a gun, a razor blade.

509
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,260
For Negan?

510
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,650
No!

511
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,920
One way or another, he is gonna use me to hurt my friends --

512
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,490
our friends.

513
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,820
And there is nothing I can do about it

514
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,860
except make sure I'm not alive to give him the chance.

515
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,320
If he has me, he will hurt them.

516
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,900
I have to die.

517
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,740
It's the only way.

518
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,100
I-I don't -- I-I don't think that --

519
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,960
I know you won't do anything to stop them.

520
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,050
I know that.

521
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,120
But, please, Eugene...

522
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,810
don't let them use me to hurt our people.

523
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,890
Please, you have to give me something to stop this

524
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,590
-- a gun, a knife, glass.

525
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,290
I don't care.

526
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,830
I have to die.

527
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,230
Please.

528
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,780
I...

529
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,440
I will consider it.

530
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,370
Thank you.

531
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,420
We don't need all this, do we?

532
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,570
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

533
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,380
It's not just the ones I killed.

534
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,810
I think about the people I didn't kill, too.

535
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,630
We're gonna bring them back when it's all over.

536
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,980
I-I want to go with you.

537
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,610
Some of us do, but not all of us,

538
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,340
and it has to be all of us.

539
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,990
My grandmother thinks you'll all be dead.

540
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:08,360
Yeah, well, your grandmother's wrong about a lot of things.

541
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,650
Where is she?

542
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,660
She didn't want to see this.

543
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,160
She's lying down. I hit her pretty hard.

544
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,370
Thanks for saving my life before.

545
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,270
And the other time.

546
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,280
Oh, and then the other time.

547
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,050
?Maybe today.

548
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,330
Thanks.

549
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,420
Thank you.

550
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,290
For what you're doing.

551
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,510
You're not leaving us any?

552
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,470
Nope. See ya later, Rachel.

553
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,650
You okay?

554
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:47,960
Yeah.

555
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,490
You're right.

556
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,960
I don't have to feel bad.

557
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,190
Sasha?

558
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,410
I'm here.

559
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,860
I've given our last exchange a good, hard pro/con think.

560
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,620
I've decided to grant your request.

561
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,970
This will do it.

562
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,230
It's a poison, homemade by yours truly.

563
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,280
It will bring about certain death in approximately 20 to 30 minutes upon the moment of ingestion.

564
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,670
I would like to believe that it's painless.

565
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,330
I am not -- I'm not certain.

566
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,900
I made it at the behest of others for similar reasons,

567
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,250
only it came to pass that they were feeding me the bum's steer,

568
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,430
so I cut bait.

569
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,110
The difference here is that

570
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,510
you and I have been long-time traveling companions,

571
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,670
and you have proven yourself to be honest, brave,

572
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,020
and fully self-aware.

573
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,780
I'm certain I owe you for things.

574
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,330
You asked me for a way out.

575
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,800
I had access to one.

576
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,590
For the record, I absolutely do not want you to go.

577
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,720
But it sounds to me like you happen to be already gone.

578
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,740
Hey, are you okay?

579
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,330
Where's Sasha?

580
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,950
There's someone here.

581
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,030
Slow down. Come on. Whoa!

582
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,860
He says he wants to help us.

583
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,840
That true?

584
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,860
You want to help?

585
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,620
I do.

586
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,210
Okay.

587
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,530
Get on your knees.
