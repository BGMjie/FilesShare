1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,580
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead."

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,610
I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,980
He obviously doesn't wanna be found.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,200
Yes, he does.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,860
We came to ask you to join us in fighting the Saviors.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,320
People will die, and not just the Saviors.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,240
I offer our friend Daryl asylum.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,670
He will be safe here.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,220
It's time to fight.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,130
No...

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,550
this is something I am not a part of.

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,650
Gavin, tell your man to stop.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,500
Diane.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,960
Got it.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,280
Good shot.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,350
My sister had that dress.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,530
Don't think about it.

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,530
Nice.

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,890
It's getting to be like clockwork.

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,560
Now, boss?

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,620
Yes, Jerry.

22
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,270
It looks light.

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,330
Perhaps you might look again, Gavin.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,090
We've met our obligations.

25
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,670
You're right.

26
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,830
Doesn't seem like much, but 8, 9, 10.

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,180
You're right.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,990
I want his gun.

29
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,450
In fact, I don't think this asshole should have a gun ever.

30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,450
No guns for bad boys.

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,400
You hit me first, prick.

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,490
What's that?

33
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,150
Okay.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,790
Where do we go from here?

35
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,990
That's right, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,420
Where do we go from here?

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,510
Hand him your weapon, Richard.

38
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,300
Stand down, idiot.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
Suck on it, you little shit.

40
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,840
Richard! ?

41
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,560
Stand down!

42
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,280
Ezekiel, you know I can't have this.

43
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,880
We can't have this.

44
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,920
Richard will refrain from attending our future exchanges.

45
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,430
No. No, Ezekiel, you're gonna keep bringing him.

46
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,280
'Cause if this doesn't stop,

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,210
if this starts becoming a real problem,

48
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,860
you remember what I said.

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,510
He is still batting first on the lineup.

50
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,450
Almost did it myself just now.

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,200
I know it's not his fault, but...

52
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,190
this has got to stop.

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,970
So...

54
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,280
things might need to get a little...

55
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,870
visceral.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,030
Jared, get the hell up!

57
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,230
Let's get the hell out of here.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,220
Can I, um...

59
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,700
Can I have my stick back, please?

60
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,130
Someone gave it to me.

61
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,350
Someone who's gone.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,720
Gavin, you got to let me turn up this dipshit.

63
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,880
No! No!

64
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,240
Just...

65
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,480
read the goddamn room, sensei.

66
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,550

My sister loved that dress.

78
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,170
You were quick with that today.

79
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,460
Impressive, Benjamin.

80
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,590
Told you I'm getting better.

81
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,660
You were a trifle too quick.

82
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,180
Just because you now know how to fight

83
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,570
doesn't mean you should seek one.

84
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,590
Yeah, but it just happened. I wasn't thinking.

85
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,710
You have to.

86
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,500
Every time from this time forward, so you shall.

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,320
Yes?

88
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,200
Yes.

89
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,930
Richard.

90
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,960
We shall speak later.

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,870
Jerry.

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,430
You're sick with this stick, man.

93
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,180
Jerry!

94
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,590
Hey, uh, do you want to head to the infirmary?

95
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,510
No. I'm okay.

96
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,010
Where'd you go in them trucks?

97
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,820
I need to speak to Daryl alone. That okay?

98
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,430
Yeah, I'll get you something for that cut.

99
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,180
Yeah.

100
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,100
You went to see them, right?

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,360
Yeah.

102
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,930
Part of your deal?

103
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,670
What the hell's wrong with you?

104
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,280
You're bleeding.

105
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,780
They did that to you.

106
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,110
- You know what they are. - I do.

107
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,830
You know, if Carol were here,

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,690
she saw all that...

109
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,180
if she knew about Abraham...

110
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,490
and Glenn...

111
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,530
she'd be leading us right to them,

112
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,700
ready to kill them all.

113
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,450
She would.

114
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,720
And that's why she left, man.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,070
I'm practicing.

116
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,050
Gonna have to start using these more.

117
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,660
The Saviors are smart enough to know I shouldn't have a gun around them.

118
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,300
Morgan said you're a bowman.

119
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,980
Why?

120
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,140
'Cause we want the same things.

121
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,170
I need your help.

122
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,110
We need something to move Ezekiel.

123
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,700
This is it.

124
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,060
Alexandria, the Hilltop, and the Kingdom hitting first,

125
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,550
hitting hard, and then we wipe the Saviors from the Earth.

126
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,820
Keeping people...

127
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,050
dozens and dozens and dozens of good people...

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,210
keeping them safe.

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,330
They ride this road.

130
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,590
If we see cars, it's the Saviors.

131
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,980
They've been coming in packs of two or three lately.

132
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,820
That's why I need you.

133
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,240
I can't take them alone.

134
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,680
We're gonna hit them with the guns first...

135
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,060
and then the Molotovs.

136
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,760
Then back to the guns until they're dead.

137
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,070
- Why the fire? - Needs to look bad.

138
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,330
The Saviors who discover what's left...

139
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,580
we want them to be angry.

140
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,510
I left a trail from here to the weapons cache I planted,

141
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,420
to the cabin of that someone Ezekiel cares about.

142
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,120
Who's that?

143
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,210
It's just some loner he met.

144
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,150
Sometimes he brings food.

145
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,170
Why don't they live in the Kingdom?

146
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,170
I don't know.

147
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,330
She lives out there, she'll die out there.

148
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,170
It's a woman?

149
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,910
What does that matter? She's got more balls than you and me.

150
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,470
She's gonna die either way.

151
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,740
When the Saviors come and find their buddies dead,

152
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,700
if they know their elbow from their asshole

153
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,600
and can follow an obvious spoor,

154
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,580
they're gonna go to the weapons cache and then to the cabin,

155
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,780
and they're gonna attack this woman.

156
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
What's her name?

157
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,210
Maybe they kill her, maybe they don't,

158
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,400
but it's gonna show Ezekiel what he needs to do.

159
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,790
Her name. What is it?

160
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,920
She's tough. Maybe she'll live.

161
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,410
Say her damn name!

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,230
Carol.

163
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,100
I hoped you didn't know her,

164
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,920
but I didn't think you'd care,

165
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,660
'cause you know what needs to happen.

166
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,650
- No. - ?Maybe she'll live.

167
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,490
Look, this -- this is how -- this is how this could happen.

168
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,320
This is how we can get rid of the Saviors,

169
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,250
how we all can have a future.

170
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,390
She's living out there on her own,

171
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,180
- just waiting to die. - ?No!

172
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,840
If we don't do anything, a hell of a lot more people are gonna die,

173
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,980
people who want to live!

174
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,950
You stay the hell away from Carol, you hear me?

175
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,730
It's them.

176
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,610
Look, we can wait for things to go bad,

177
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,230
we lose people...

178
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,670
or we can do the hard thing...

179
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,250
and choose our fate for ourselves.

180
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,640
No.

181
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,280
Sorry.

182
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,340
There'll be more.

183
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,810
Or those --

184
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,440
they're gonna ride back this way later.

185
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,560
We'll have another chance.

186
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,060
But we're running out of time.

187
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,020
If you and your people want to move against the Saviors...

188
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,570
you need to do it soon, and you need the Kingdom.

189
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,900
What we have to do requires sacrifice one way or another.

190
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,890
Guys like us...

191
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,680
we've already lost so much.

192
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,650
You don't know me.

193
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,150
I know...

194
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,470
that Carol, living on her own like that...

195
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,370
she might as well be dead right now.

196
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,080
She gets hurt, she dies,

197
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,140
if she catches a fever,

198
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,440
if she's taken out by a walker...

199
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,250
if she gets hit by lightning --

200
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,590
anything -- anything happens to her, I'll kill you.

201
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,170
I would die for the Kingdom.

202
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,980
Why don't you?

203
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,050
Are you a collective, or does one lead?

204
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,480
This.

205
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,940
I'm Rick.

206
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,320
We own your lives.

207
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,420
You want buy them back?

208
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,890
Have anything?

209
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,280
Well, you have one of my people.

210
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,930
Gabriel.

211
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,260
I want to see him first. Then we can talk.

212
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,710
The boat things you took got taken.

213
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,810
Saw them, so we took the rest.

214
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,890
And we took him.

215
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,890
Well, then you know we have nothing

216
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,800
to buy back our lives with.

217
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,130
That's what you'll have soon -- nothing.

218
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,490
Because me and my people already belong to that group

219
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,610
who took those supplies from the boat.

220
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,250
They're called the Saviors.

221
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,280
They own our lives.

222
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,400
And if you kill us,

223
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,050
you'll be taking something from them.

224
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,720
And they will come looking.

225
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,690
You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors --

226
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,780
either they kill you or they own you.

227
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,780
But there is a way out.

228
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,480
Join us.

229
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,720
Join us in fighting them.

230
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,330
No.

231
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,100
Rosita, don't!

232
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,780
Everybody, stop!

233
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,720
Just wait!

234
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,560
Let us go, or I will kill her!

235
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,310
Away from Tamiel now.

236
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,860
The Saviors, they --

237
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,080
they have other places, other communities.

238
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,390
They have things --

239
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,140
food, weapons, vehicles, fuel.

240
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,060
Whatever you want, the Saviors have it.

241
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,040
Away from Tamiel.

242
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,020
Your words now.

243
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,480
If you join us and we beat them together,

244
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,390
you can have much of what's theirs.

245
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,510
Fighting with us, you'll be rewarded,

246
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,320
more than you can imagine.

247
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,480
Want something now.

248
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,900
Rick...

249
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,240
can do anything.

250
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,460
This group?

251
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,690
They found me -- here, so far from our home.

252
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,810
What do you need?

253
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,210
Just tell us -- we'll get it for you.

254
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,820
We'll show you what we can do.

255
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,780
Now.

256
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,540
Tamiel, Brion...

257
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,840
show Rick Up Up Up.

258
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,790
It's okay.

259
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,380
Here.

260
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,360
Sit.

261
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
Thanks. I'm okay.

262
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,710
Who are these people?

263
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,830
New best friends, I guess?

264
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,940
Where are they taking him?

265
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,460
All of us, here since the change.

266
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,940
We take. We don't bother.

267
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,780
Things grow harder.

268
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,090
We open cans, sometimes inside's rotten.

269
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,880
Time's passed.

270
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,990
Things are changing again.

271
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,940
So maybe we change.

272
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,210
Maybe.

273
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,430
Need to know you're real with this,

274
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,850
that you're worth it.

275
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,550
What did you do?!

276
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,330
Rick!

277
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,520
I'm all right.

278
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,910
Rick!

279
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,000
The walls!

280
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,510
Use them!

281
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,770
You believe us now?!

282
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,110
Just tell us what you want...

283
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,220
and we'll get it.

284
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,790
Guns.

285
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,910
A lot.

286
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,270
A lot.

287
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,880
And then we fight your fight.

288
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,900
You know we will win?

289
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,870
Oh, I know it.

290
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,090
After, we get half of what's won.

291
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,560
Oh, you'll get a third.

292
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,420
And we're taking back what you just stole from us.

293
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,580
Half.

294
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,720
A third.

295
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,100
Half.

296
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,960
A third.

297
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,970
A third, and we keep what we stole.

298
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,240
Half of the jars, the ones we took.

299
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,390
One time, this time.

300
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,380
Yes?

301
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,770
Say yes.

302
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,060
Yes.

303
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,620
And the guns.

304
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,430
And the guns.

305
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,300
Waited by the boat long time.

306
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,540
Want something for it.

307
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,330
So it's this.

308
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,150
Jars and guns, guns and jars.

309
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,990
You waited for someone to get the supplies off that boat for you?

310
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,880
Long time.

311
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,160
We take. We don't bother.

312
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,130
You had that...

313
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,470
thing down there for someone to prove themselves?

314
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,010
No.

315
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,830
His name was Winslow.

316
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,230
What were you gonna do with Gabriel?

317
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,730
Go.

318
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,440
Deal expires.

319
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,320
Soon.

320
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,650
What's your name?

321
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,080
Jadis.

322
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,070
We have a deal.

323
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,870
I told Richard no more visits.

324
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,290
I am aware.

325
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,480
Your desire is solitude.

326
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,640
That's what I've ordered to be facilitated.

327
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,830
My men are here clearing the wasted.

328
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,100
The dead are quite inconsiderate when it comes to those who are wanting to be alone.

329
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,250
I thought our efforts would be quiet enough

330
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,940
to fall beneath your notice.

331
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,000
You're the one who opened the door.

332
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,710
Tripped my wire.

333
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,890
Thought I caught it in time.

334
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,550
Sorry.

335
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,870
You hid them well, lady.

336
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,060
Don't call her "Lady."

337
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,960
Ma'am, Ms., missus...

338
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,770
You can shut up now.

339
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,790
Copy.

340
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,780
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

341
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,530
Hold up.

342
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,510
Cobbler.

343
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,300
Kevin said you like it.

344
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,180
Just in case you did open the door.

345
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,650
Go.

346
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,370
Okay.

347
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,910
Jesus took us to the Kingdom.

348
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,100
Morgan said you just left.

349
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,990
I was out here.

350
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,240
I saw you.

351
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,960
Why'd you go?

352
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,900
I had to.

353
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,070
I heard something when I was on watch,

354
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,850
from inside the wall.

355
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,620
I went into the pantry, one of them jumped me.

356
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,540
She was angry because she didn't get the supplies from the boat

357
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,820
after all the waiting.

358
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,410
So they made me pack up everything else.

359
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,480
But she said they were at the boat, so I hoped...

360
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,260
No. You didn't just hope.

361
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,650
You got us here.

362
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,910
I was beginning to lose faith.

363
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,010
But then I saw you.

364
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,870
And you nodded at me.

365
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,810
I mean, just the fact that you knew I didn't leave,

366
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
that you searched and found me,

367
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,830
that you, seeing these numbers,

368
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,040
you seemed so...

369
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,480
glad.

370
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,460
We will set things right.

371
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,530
But things are gonna get very hard before that time.

372
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,660
We have to hold on.

373
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,020
I will.

374
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,610
Thank you.

375
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,410
What made you smile?

376
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,730
What made you so... confident?

377
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,520
Someone showed me enemies can become friends.

378
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,990
We shouldn't be going back to Alexandria.

379
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,530
We need to stay out

380
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,880
and look for the guns for this deal.

381
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,010
Rick is hurt. Aaron is hurt.

382
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,450
I'm more nervous about what Eric will say

383
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,270
if he sees my face like this again.

384
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,670
People back home need food.

385
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Rick wants to bring supplies back and we regroup,

386
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,340
so that's what we're doing.

387
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,010
Then I'll go on my own.

388
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,010
We are sticking together, and that's it.

389
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,980
What is your problem?

390
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,660
We're not looking for a fight right now, Rosita!

391
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,370
We're getting ready for one.

392
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,080
It's always a fight, Tara.

393
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,070
I'm not letting anyone get in our way or slow us down.

394
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,260
If we got to stop people from taking from us

395
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,880
or we got to take from other people,

396
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,790
I don't care.

397
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,110
We win.

398
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,350
Grow up.

399
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,650
Guns.

400
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,050
Soon.

401
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,540
Soon. Or else.

402
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,960
Once we get you stitched up,

403
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,220
we'll go right back out and find the guns, right?

404
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,390
That's right.

405
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,370
Do you have any idea where?

406
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,930
No, but that's never stopped us before.

407
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,780
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.

408
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,240
At least you can tell us where not to look.

409
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,100
Yeah.

410
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,320
Sure thing.

411
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,260
Let's go already.

412
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,740
Hold -- Hold on.

413
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,740
Why are you...? ?

414
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,940
Because we won.

415
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,060
And to replace the one you lost.

416
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,030
All right?

417
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,600
Let's go.

418
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,480
I couldn't lose anyone.

419
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
I couldn't lose any of them.

420
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,620
I couldn't lose you.

421
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,090
I couldn't kill them.

422
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,350
I could.

423
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,040
I would.

424
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,290
If they hurt any of our people --

425
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,610
any more of them -- that's what I would do.

426
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,820
And there wouldn't be anything left of me after that.

427
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,200
The Saviors -- did they come?

428
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,950
Yeah.

429
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,190
Did anyone get hurt?

430
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,270
Is everybody okay?

431
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,930
Did the Saviors...

432
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,500
Is everybody back home okay?

433
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,800
Daryl...

434
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,190
They came.

435
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,960
We got them all.

436
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,860
Made a deal with the rest of them, like Ezekiel.

437
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,110
Everyone's all right.

438
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,520
Everyone's all right.

439
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,710
We gonna eat or -- or I got to be a king or something

440
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,040
to get food around here?

441
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,850
Shut up.

442
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,470
Ezekiel...

443
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,030
is he okay?

444
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,480
Yeah, I think he is.

445
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,610
Watch out for yourself, all right?

446
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,210
Well, you're good with her.

447
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,500
Ezekiel will be impressed.

448
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,370
Well, figure any guy that has a pet tiger

449
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,660
can't be that bad.

450
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,090
He's okay by Carol.

451
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,370
Yeah, I found her, out in that little house.

452
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,510
Look, what I said...

453
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,920
when I said she just...

454
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,820
went away...

455
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,890
it's what she told me to do.

456
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,240
No, I get it.

457
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,350
We need the Kingdom.

458
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,770
You got to make that happen.

459
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,090
I'm sorry.

460
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,570
I mean, I -- I really am, but, uh...

461
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,420
it can't be me.

462
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:22,070
Look, whatever it is you're holding on to...

463
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,210
it's already gone, man.

464
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,950
Wake the hell up.

465
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,280
You're the same as me, Daryl.

466
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,800
You don't know shit about me.

467
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,840
No, I do.

468
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,910
'Cause you didn't tell Carol what happened.

469
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,970
You didn't, 'cause she'd be here otherwise.

470
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,640
And I'm glad for that.

471
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,280
See, we're all holding on to something.

472
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,650
I'm going back to Hilltop in the morning

473
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,120
and getting ready.
