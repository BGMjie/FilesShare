A single bullet ain't gonna do it.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,930
Make me a bullet.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,650
Somebody has to pay the price.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,100
What is this?

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,230
This little bad boy made from scratch.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,590
You tell me who made this.

8
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,080
Please. Please don't.

9
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,120
Please, god, no.

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,650
I hate this. Please!

21

There's more at the library.

22
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,870
A lot more.

23
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,820
You, uh...

24
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,250
You have a library?

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,590
Your friend Daryl

26
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,150
didn't get a chance to see it before he bounced.

27
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,130
He escaped?

28
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,940
Yeah.

29
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,130
You know where he is?

30
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,390
No.

31
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,630
I'd tell you if I did.

32
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,210
Vonda N. Mcintyre.

33
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,890
Th-this will be satisfactory.

34
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,290
You hungry?

35
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,530
I'll get you something. What do you want?

36
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,430
What do I want?

37
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,700
Yeah, to eat. What do you want?

38
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,830
Anything?

39
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,200
Sure. Whatever.

40
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,790
Really? Anything I want?

41
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,200
Dude, yes.

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,550
You can have anything. What do you want?

43
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,380
- Can I have lobster? - No, you can't have lobster.

44
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,370
What the hell do you think this is?

45
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,930
Do you have canned pasta and tomato sauce?

46
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,000
You want orange-y or red?

47
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,970
Orange-y.

48
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,410
All right.

49
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,090
What about pickles? I-I like pickles.

50
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,180
We're out of pickles.

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,580
What about potato chips?

52
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,770
We got chips.

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,950
Number 42 makes them.

54
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,530
Number 42 is a coding system for persons here?

55
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,500
For the workers, yeah.

56
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,170
They make said chips fresh?

57
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,140
Yeah, they got a kettle --

58
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,090
No, thanks.

59
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,660
Okay. I'll be back in 10.

60
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,060
Enjoy your new place.

61
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,280
Good mornin', sunshine.

62
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,030
Is it just as cozy as you remember?

63
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,230
You spent a lot of time on the wrong side of the door

64
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,170
after that stupid road trip with the wife and Tina.

65
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,290
So let's talk about now.

66
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,500
We went out looking for your little failed project

67
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,760
for a few hours, just around the perimeter --

68
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,100
Tip to taint, as it were --

69
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,750
right about the time I had you thrown in here,

70
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,540
and when I got back,

71
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,340
I realized I...

72
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,240
was short...

73
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,960
a wife.

74
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,020
Which one?

75
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,570
Sherry.

76
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,910
You know anything about that, Dwighty boy?

77
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,240
'cause I got to tell you,

78
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,340
that is one hell of a coincidence,

79
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,880
her leaving just a few short hours after Daryl took off.

80
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, and he didn't force his way out.

81
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,310
No.

82
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,020
Somebody opened the door for him.

83
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,100
It wasn't Sherry.

84
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,930
Dwighty boy...

85
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,630
Was it you?

86
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,540
Did it work the other way around?

87
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,860
You were supposed to break him.

88
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,410
Did he break you?

89
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,400
I mean, let's face it --

90
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,300
You've got some pretty legitimate grievances.

91
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,710
You change your stripes on me, Dwighty?

92
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,070
You startin' to see things different?

93
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,590
After all this...

94
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,240
Before and after...

95
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,080
Hell, after everything...

96
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,790
...Who are you, Dwight?

97
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,630
I'm Negan.

98
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,950
Daryl isn't like you.

99
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,950
He's...

100
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,070
Emotional.

101
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,660
So he's either on his way home,

102
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,450
Or he's coming back here

103
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,570
to try to kill some more of us.

104
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,180
Mostly you and me.

105
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,770
Either way, we'll find him.

106
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,070
So...

107
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,100
do you think you know where Sherry went?

108
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,120
Yeah.

109
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,320
Bring her back.

110
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,620
Sort it out.

111
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,190
Stitch him up.

112
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,270
Fix what you can fix.

113
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,730
You don't think she did it?

114
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,670
You think she did?

115
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,100
I got to know her a little bit.

116
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,010
Not well.

117
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,740
Well enough to know what happened.

118
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,780
She saw Daryl in here, in the state he was in.

119
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,590
She let him go.

120
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,680
She was soft.

121
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,400
She has a big heart.

122
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,660
You were just beaten and thrown in a cell --

123
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,220
unfairly, if you ask me.

124
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,560
And you're back to it.

125
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,990
You may wind up running an outpost for him.

126
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,080
You get it.

127
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,470
I like to think that I do.

128
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,630
The type of selfless, tender soul

129
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,360
who would marry Negan to save her husband's life?

130
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,780
That's exactly the kind of person who really isn't...

131
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,420
expected to be around anymore.

132
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,470
Thanks.

133
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,170
Just trying to help.

134
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,570
Stuff people grow, stuff people make,

135
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,810
stuff, you know, people scavenge.

136
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,240
Beer, bread, cut your head.

137
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,300
Cut your what?

138
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,150
Barber.

139
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,000
Might be able to kill that thing on your head.

140
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,850
We use a points system.

141
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,880
You're one of us now, not them.

142
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,270
They eat shit, we eat good.

143
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,700
Write what you took or what they did,

144
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,260
how much it was worth, sign your name.

145
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,240
That's it.

146
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,130
Must be your lucky day, haircut.

147
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,210
Are these homemade?

148
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,920
Yeah.

149
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,510
That's some good DIY stuff there.

150
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,650
No -- no, thank you.

151
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,190
You want something...

152
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,490
you take it, haircut.

153
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,810
We'll send Simon over to take a peak,

154
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,030
sort of good-cop this thing first,

155
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,670
see how far we get.

156
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,240
There he is.

157
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,200
Man of the hour!

158
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,130
Come on over here, big fella.

159
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,970
Don't be rude, asshole.

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Say hello.

161
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,530
H-h-hello.

162
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,790
You got a name, asshole?

163
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,400
Eugene.

164
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,970
Now us.

165
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,990
Who are you?

166
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm Negan.

167
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,710
Well, Eugene...

168
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,650
I know you remember Lucille.

169
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,610
Now, you see this right here?

170
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,460
You might have to get real close.

171
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,380
That, my friend, is the bullet you made.

172
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,620
Now, under normal circumstances,

173
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,230
I'd be showing you that real close over and over again.

174
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,010
But, Eugene, see,

175
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,790
all I really want to know is if you are a smarty-pants.

176
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,870
You know things?

177
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,290
Answer the question.

178
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,350
I -- I am, indeed, a smarty-pants.

179
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,640
I...taught myself to cast bullets.

180
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,710
I...found a --

181
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,660
found a machine shop

182
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,640
with the necessary...

183
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,150
I-I read a lot, and, um...

184
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,220
although my --

185
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,960
Even though my memory is not considered eidetic,

186
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,510
I don't skim and I don't scrimp.

187
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,430
If knowledge is dropped,

188
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,230
I do, indeed, pick it up.

189
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,110
Oh, you really are just some asshole.

190
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,280
N-no. I'm not.

191
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,040
I have PHDs in biochemistry,

192
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,530
as well as immunology and microbiology,

193
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,110
and I've completed my doctorate, which makes me a doctor.

194
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,020
Prior to the collapse,

195
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,740
I was part of a 10-person team at the human genome project,

196
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,020
working under Dr. T. Brooks Ellis

197
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,460
to weaponize diseases to fight weaponized diseases.

198
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,820
Fire with, uh... You know...fire.

199
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,180
Well, see, interdepartmental drinks were --

200
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,260
All right, Dr. Smarty-pants.

201
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,250
You ought to be able to crack this without breaking a sweat.

202
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,740
You see, I have a lot of free labor here at the fence,

203
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,300
living dead pricks that help keep the riffraff out.

204
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,510
Problem is, they don't keep. They fall apart.

205
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,810
Like that poor sack of...

206
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,070
pile of shit there.

207
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:30,200
So, Dr. Smarty-Pants,

208
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,640
How do we keep them on their feet?

209
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,160
You, um...

210
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,090
smelt on the regs, correct?

211
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,490
I saw that among the legacy equipment on the floor that

212
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,520
- you possess an operational smelter.  - And?

213
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,460
You already possess the means to resolve your issue.

214
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,660
Step one, melt down scrap metal.

215
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,080
Step two, pour it over the compromised walker

216
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,330
as they are in contact with the chain link.

217
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,160
The liquid metal will harden...

218
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,530
Both maintaining bodily integrity for the walker

219
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,210
as well as affixing them to the fence.

220
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,250
Bonus points for covering their head

221
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,590
and protecting them from head trauma from hostiles and calamities.

222
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,480
God damn!

223
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,940
If that ain't the coolest thing I've ever heard in my life!

224
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,590
Not only is that practical, it is just bad-ass!

225
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,020
Look at you, Dr. Smarty-pants.

226
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,570
Did Rick have you doing this kind of valuable stuff for him?

227
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,720
His loss, our gain.

228
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,050
I feel like I need to give you some kind of signing bonus here.

229
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,440
Uh, w-well, I wa-- I was gifted these pickles.

230
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,050
No.

231
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,830
As a token of my gratitude,

232
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,730
I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives

233
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,280
to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.

234
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,450
Now, I don't think I have to worry about this.

235
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,960
But who knows how truly smart you are?

236
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,480
No sex.

237
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,000
That is a grave no-no.

238
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,630
However, you can have a little dinner,

239
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,810
some drinks, share a few laughs.

240
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,830
There is nothing like beautiful women that smell good

241
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,590
to make you feel human again.

242
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,820
I wouldn't know anything about that.

243
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,490
D-d-did you say "Wives", meaning plural?

244
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,720
Hell yes, I did.

245
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,620
What does Dr. Smarty-pants say

246
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,880
to his new bestest friend in the whole wide world?

247
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,240
What does he say?

248
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,820
Thank you.

249
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,110
Fully, completely...

250
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,610
Sincerely, seriously...Thank you.

251
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,130
Okay.

252
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,110
Why don't you go have some fun?

253
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,470
What the hell am I even looking at?

254
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,180
The insect-like creature is called Yar.

255
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,120
It is attempting to exact revenge

256
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,820
upon the evil Qotile for the destruction of Razak IV.

257
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,880
Maybe you should take it easy, Amber.

258
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,210
Maybe I shouldn't, Frankie.

259
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,980
Uh, we could play something else.

260
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,100
Warlords?

261
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,410
It's four-player and quite the hoot.

262
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,780
Whatever you want.

263
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,030
This is your night.

264
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,510
Do you want a massage?

265
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,950
Negan loves them.

266
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,860
And I was a licensed therapist.

267
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,960
You know, before.

268
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,420
While I appreciate the gesture

269
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,040
and your commitment to your assigned objective,

270
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,480
I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening

271
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
of your own volition.

272
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,390
Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.

273
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,600
Would you care for more microwave popcorn?

274
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,170
Hey, just because this was Negan's idea

275
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,380
doesn't mean that we don't want to be here.

276
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,190
I'd be down with just having an intelligent conversation.

277
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,050
Well, I suppose a conversation would be acceptable

278
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,330
under the current circumstance.

279
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,180
What would you like to talk about?

280
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,820
Uh, how about the human genome project?

281
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,360
I could talk about that shit all night.

282
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,860
In truth...

283
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,430
The bulk of my work for the HGP

284
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,670
fell under the auspices of the black box program,

285
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,070
of which I am not at liberty to discuss.

286
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,160
In all likelihood, even if I could,

287
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,690
it'd probably escape your comprehension.

288
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,490
Did he just insult us, Tanya?

289
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,420
It was not a dis.

290
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,520
It was simply a statement of fact.

291
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,950
My intelligence has been objectively measured.

292
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,480
I am fully a man apart.

293
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,820
So, what, are you, like, one of those guys who can make a bomb

294
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,100
out of bleach and a toothpick or something?

295
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,410
Of course not.

296
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,110
That would at least require dry yeast, hydrogen peroxide,

297
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,700
and a small amount of liquid dish soap,

298
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,820
maybe some, you know, bathroom or drain cleaner,

299
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,800
some balloons or something like that,

300
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,130
few other common household sundries.

301
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,160
Seriously?

302
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,420
Serious as sepsis.

303
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,110
Seriously?

304
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,640
So stupid.

305
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,110
I'm hoping to illustrate the opposite.

306
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,740
Just slaves?

307
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,740
Excuse me?

308
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,010
Whatever.

309
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,600
Dr. Eugene, did you just make helium out of toilet stuff?

310
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,320
Hydrogen.

311
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,280
It's cool, Keno.

312
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,200
We're good.

313
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,700
Relax.

314
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,310
You're one of us.

315
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,320
I should disclose in advance

316
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,590
I may have oversold this one by classifying it as a bomb.

317
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,690
As the hydrogen peroxide decomposes,

318
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,860
the reaction will release energy in the form of heat.

319
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,580
Dr. Eugene, can you please just show us some good shit?

320
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,520
I'm gonna light this candle.

321
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,180
- Cool! - Finally.

322
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,670
No, I mean, I'm gonna light this candle.

323
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,860
Oh, no.

324
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,930
Yay!

325
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,700
Yeah!

326
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,760
Yeah!

327
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,310
Honey?

328
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,820
D -- we always said that if we got separated,

329
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,390
I should come back here and wait for you.

330
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,230
You'd show up with beer and pretzels.

331
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,540
You remember that?

332
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,360
I know.

333
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,080
You probably don't.

334
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,070
You always said that when we started dating,

335
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,920
you forgot to tell me you had a shitty memory.

336
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,550
You used to get so frustrated by it...

337
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,200
knowing you wouldn't remember those good days...

338
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,720
those special days.

339
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,140
I felt bad for you.

340
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,440
I remember you said

341
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,050
there was so much you wanted to hold on to,

342
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,330
and then it'd be gone.

343
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,950
But you're lucky you don't remember things, D.

344
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,390
I wish I could wait for you now.

345
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,560
But I don't know if you'd come with me

346
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,760
Or if you'd take me back there

347
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,040
Or you'd kill me.

348
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,510
You didn't want to live in that world,

349
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,890
and I made you.

350
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,530
I did what I did because I didn't want you to die.

351
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,790
But now you've killed,

352
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,250
and you've become everything you didn't want to be,

353
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,420
And it's my fault.

354
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,050
You were better than me.

355
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,970
Most people are.

356
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,780
I let Daryl go

357
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,820
Because he reminded you of who you used to be.

358
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,080
And I wanted to let you forget.

359
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,840
I don't think I'm gonna make it out here,

360
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,120
but you're wrong.

361
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,020
Being there isn't better than being dead.

362
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,180
It's worse.

363
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,130
I hope you realize that,

364
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,730
and I hope you get away.

365
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,640
I hope you remember the good days,

366
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,690
even just one of them, but...

367
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,550
I don't think you will.

368
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,840
I don't think you'll ever read this.

369
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,780
I loved who you were.

370
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,180
I'm sorry I made you into who you are.

371
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,820
Goodbye.

372
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,100
Honey.

373
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,640
We can hear the Yars and the Qotile, Eugene.

374
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,910
I was given to understand that last night's shinny

375
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,480
was supposed to be a singular incident.

376
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,690
He didn't send us.

377
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,940
We need your help.

378
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,100
You saw Amber last night.

379
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,110
She just drinks and cries.

380
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,950
She didn't want this.

381
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
We signed up for it.

382
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,110
It's better for us.

383
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,670
She had to.

384
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,270
Her mom needed meds.

385
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,460
She can't work.

386
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,710
Amber thought...

387
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,750
that she could live with it.

388
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,960
She can't.

389
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,040
She asked us to help her end it.

390
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,090
You aren't afforded any...

391
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,520
mental-health services?

392
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,550
No.

393
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,040
- Are you serious? - I mean, there's a licensed masseuse here.

394
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,260
Uh, odds being what they are --

395
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,000
There's no one like that here.

396
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,900
So this...is it.

397
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,930
She just wants to take something.

398
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,190
She wants to go to sleep and not wake up.

399
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,910
That would be wildly irresponsible.

400
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,950
She dies at night, in her sleep,

401
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,550
she turns while everyone is asleep...

402
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,710
We'll handle that part.

403
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,970
We were hoping that you could make something for her,

404
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,110
'cause we know that you can make things.

405
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,760
Look, I know that this is crazy and you barely know us...

406
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,480
But we can tell that you are a good man.

407
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,580
There aren't many of those left.

408
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,090
Truth of the matter is, I'm not good.

409
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,180
I'm not lawful, neutral, or chaotic --

410
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,460
None of the above.

411
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,750
Are you saying you can't do it?

412
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,870
Lack of ability is not the problem here.

413
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,310
I could jerry-rig a lethal toxin

414
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,940
with the assets at hand here.

415
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,190
- No problemo. I have the -- - Then help us.

416
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,730
A pill, a shot, whatever.

417
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,600
We need two of them.

418
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,180
'cause we don't know when we could get our chance.

419
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,950
She's gonna do it, with or without us.

420
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,680
She'll suffer, and maybe someone else will get hurt.

421
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,050
You are good, Eugene.

422
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,820
You have to be.

423
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,960
How much does she weigh?

424
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,410
Don't know. Maybe...120.

425
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,120
Why?

426
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,050
If you could get me her exact weight,

427
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,830
I could guarantee a semi-precise t.O. Pain-free d.

428
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,250
A.S.A.P.

429
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,700
Best I can do for now.

430
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,180
Come back later.

431
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,120
We're playing poker with some guys.

432
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,870
Try to hook you up.

433
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,000
You kidding? Can't play poker.

434
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,580
I got to be out diggin' postholes

435
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,800
at the crack of dawn tomorrow.

436
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,010
I would like a single blister pack

437
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,800
of your most extra-strength cold capsule.

438
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,230
The line's a line!

439
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,520
What, they not have them where you come from?

440
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,920
You don't know how they work?

441
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,410
No, I am familiar --

442
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,040
Get in it, prick.

443
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,340
What is your number?

444
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,550
What's yours?

445
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,100
16.

446
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,370
All right, number 16.

447
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,090
My name is Dr. Eugene Porter.

448
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,880
I've recently been appointed

449
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,580
to the newly created post of chief engineer of this facility.

450
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,860
I report directly to Negan,

451
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,550
which means you report directly to my ass.

452
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,580
The cold capsules, now.

453
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,250
I didn't know.

454
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,370
We just -- we get so many new faces, I didn't...

455
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,530
I want this, too.

456
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,730
And this.

457
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,070
I don't even know what you call this.

458
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,220
I'm gonna call it a gremblygunk.

459
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,200
Did you find her?

460
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,100
Where is she?

461
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,210
I killed her.

462
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,780
She ran away from me right into a mess of dead ones,

463
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,420
So, I, uh... Made it quick.

464
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,210
It still hurts.

465
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,650
Feels better with a bandage.

466
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,470
I wasn't talking about that.

467
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,580
I would tell you to just forget about her, but...

468
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,990
...I don't see anyone else doing that anytime soon,

469
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,390
considering what she did.

470
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,990
Oh, we've all done things.

471
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,330
Yes, but before we got here,

472
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,610
Before we understood...

473
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,700
We were cowards about it.

474
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,970
We don't -- we don't get to have big hearts.

475
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,830
Remember that.

476
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,500
Wh-what is this?

477
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,800
You'll find out.

478
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,640
You are gonna want to pay close attention to this.

479
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,370
no, no, no, no!

480
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,530
Why?

481
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,880
I didn't do anything.

482
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,530
I found this little souvenir

483
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,060
tucked away in your desk.

484
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,660
I-I-I don't know what that is.

485
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,890
You...

486
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,500
left the door open and let my puppy out.

487
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,290
You knew Sherry hated Daryl being here,

488
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,200
So you let him out for her, be the hero.

489
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,830
Then you could move in.

490
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,320
That...

491
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,930
is some weaselly shit right there.

492
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,130
But I didn't. She's the one who ran --

493
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,330
Oh, she ran?

494
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,990
You know why she ran?!

495
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,830
Because she knew I would blame her, which...

496
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,820
I did.

497
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,890
But, see, Sherry told Dwighty boy the whole story

498
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,520
right before she was torn apart.

499
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,790
A super hot girl, horrifically killed

500
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,490
Because of your greedy, delusional,

501
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,750
and tiny little prick.

502
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,210
It's not true. Dwight?

503
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,680
He's lying about it.

504
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,840
- I would never do that. - Why?

505
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,600
Why? Why would he do that?

506
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,130
Why would he intentionally try to hurt you?

507
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,460
Sherry's gone.

508
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,970
And if he's lying...

509
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,410
And she's out there, I will find her.

510
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,380
And then I will burn the other side of his face off

511
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,060
until he dies.

512
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,380
So, what was he gonna get out of this?

513
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,290
No.

514
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,710
No.

515
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,610
You see, I know my Dwighty boy.

516
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,580
See, all he needed...

517
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,470
was one more night in the hole,

518
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,130
get his head screwed on straight.

519
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,800
It worked before, and it worked now.

520
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,930
Ain't that right, Dwight?

521
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,200
Oh, yeah.

522
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,150
oh, please.

523
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,090
No, please.

524
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,180
Please, please, please!

525
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,530
Oh, jesus, don't burn me.

526
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,520
Please!

527
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,800
Please!

528
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
No.

529
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,250
No, no, please!

530
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,250
Now you know I hate this shit.

531
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,350
Just tell me you did it and that you're sorry,

532
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,280
And I don't have to do this.

533
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,950
Yes.

534
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,220
Yes, I did it -- all of it.

535
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,950
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

536
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,070
Please...

537
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,550
I'm sorry.

538
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,940
That's all you had to say.

539
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,840
That is all you had to say.

540
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,300
A good thing we got a spare Dr. Carson.

541
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,620
I trust you, Dwighty boy.

542
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,770
Never shoulda doubted you.

543
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,170
Sherry was one of my favorites.

544
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,400
I'm sorry.

545
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,660
I'm not.

546
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,650
Ice-cold.

547
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,040
I love it.

548
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,890
Come.

549
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,840
Hello.

550
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,700
Are you all right?

551
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,910
Better than that.

552
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,330
You can call next, but it might be a while.

553
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,190
Did you make the pills?

554
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,060
I did.

555
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,630
But you can't have them.

556
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,400
Amber's counting on us.

557
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,640
We told her that you were gonna help us,

558
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,260
- and she says that she -- - Pump your brakes, red.

559
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,870
Do not insult my intelligence, Frankie.

560
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,750
Said pills aren't for Amber.

561
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,260
Said pills are for Negan.

562
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,900
That's why you wanted two.

563
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,790
Didn't he kill your friends?

564
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,920
Several.

565
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,320
But I imagine we killed about 30 or so of his.

566
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,680
Turnabout and all that.

567
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,120
Give us the pills, or we'll tell Negan about it.

568
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,550
We'll tell him that it was your idea to make them

569
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,350
and that you tried to get us to help.

570
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,900
That would be a tactical error on your part.

571
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,130
They'll believe me over you

572
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,580
for the same reason he believed Dwight over the doctor.

573
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,400
You're replaceable to him.

574
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,860
I, on the other hand, am not.

575
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,590
You're a coward.

576
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,430
You're...a coward.

577
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,520
That is a correct assessment.

578
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,410
May I come in?

579
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,000
So, how you liking it here?

580
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,190
Are we doing right by Dr. Smarty-pants?

581
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,830
You know, Frankie and Tanya...

582
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,520
Nothing but good things to say about you.

583
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,520
It's all right.

584
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,020
I get it.

585
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,520
I know how hard it can be to accept change,

586
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,300
to get on the right team.

587
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,130
But I need you to understand something.

588
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,340
I do not make this invitation to everyone.

589
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,070
And I sure as shit do not make it lightly.

590
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,310
You do not need to be scared anymore.

591
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,060
You don't need to be scared.

592
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,130
You just have to answer me one question.

593
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,300
And it's a big one.

594
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,350
Who are --

595
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,520
I'm Negan.

596
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,200
I'm utterly, completely, stone-cold Negan.

597
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,430
I was Negan before I even met you.

598
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,550
I just needed to meet you properly to know.

599
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,590
I'm Negan.

600
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,020
Hey, be careful with that.

601
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,390
Hey, you want to get burned by molten metal?

602
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,880
'cause that's exactly how you get burned by molten metal.

603
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,960
Regarding me clamping down --

604
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,970
You on board?

605
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,990
I am. Just like you.

606
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,650
Don't know if you recall my handle -- I don't.

607
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,000
Eugene.

608
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,750
You're Dwight.

609
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,500
We are Negan.

610
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,050
Yeah.
