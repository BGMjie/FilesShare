74
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,230
你跟你妻子和蒂娜去愚蠢的自驾游之后
You spent a lot of time on the wrong side of the door

75
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,170
就花了许多时间待在门的错误一边
after that stupid road trip with the wife and Tina.

76
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,290
我们现在谈谈吧
So let's talk about now.

77
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,500
我们在边界周围花了几个小时
We went out looking for your little failed project

78
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,760
寻找你的失败项目
for a few hours, just around the perimeter --

79
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,100
从头到尾找了一遍
Tip to taint, as it were --

80
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,750
就在我让人把你扔进这里的时候
right about the time I had you thrown in here,

81
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,540
我回来后
and when I got back,

82
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,340
意识到自己
I realized I...

83
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,240
少了个
was short...

84
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,960
妻子
a wife.

85
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,020
哪个
Which one?

86
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,570
雪莉
Sherry.

87
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,910
你知道些什么吗  小德
You know anything about that, Dwighty boy?

88
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,240
因为我得告诉你
'cause I got to tell you,

89
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,340
这真他妈太巧了
that is one hell of a coincidence,

90
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,880
达里尔走后几小时  她就离开了
her leaving just a few short hours after Daryl took off.

91
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,000
他根本没有靠武力打出去
Oh, and he didn't force his way out.

92
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,310
没有
No.

93
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,020
有人为他开门了
Somebody opened the door for him.

94
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,100
不是雪莉
It wasn't Sherry.

95
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,930
小德
Dwighty boy...

96
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,630
是你吗
Was it you?

97
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,540
事情往反方向发展了吗
Did it work the other way around?

98
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,860
你本该击溃他的
You were supposed to break him.

99
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,410
他把你感化了吗
Did he break you?

100
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,400
实话实说
I mean, let's face it --

101
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,300
你有一些合理的不满
You've got some pretty legitimate grievances.

102
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,710
你背叛我了吗  德怀特
You change your stripes on me, Dwighty?

103
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,070
你开始有不同的想法了吗
You startin' to see things different?

104
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,590
经历了这么多
After all this...

105
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,240
之前和之后
Before and after...

106
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,080
该死  经历了这么多之后
Hell, after everything...

107
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,790
你到底是谁  德怀特
...Who are you, Dwight?

108
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,630
我是尼根
I'm Negan.

109
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,950
达里尔和你不一样
Daryl isn't like you.

110
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,950
他
He's...

111
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,070
有感情
Emotional.

112
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,660
所以他要么在回家的路上
So he's either on his way home,

113
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,450
要么在回这里的路上
Or he's coming back here

114
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,570
试图多杀我们几个人
to try to kill some more of us.

115
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,180
主要是杀你和我
Mostly you and me.

116
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,770
无论怎样  我们都会找到他
Either way, we'll find him.

117
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,070
所以...
So...

118
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,100
你知道雪莉去哪了吗
do you think you know where Sherry went?

119
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,120
知道
Yeah.

120
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,320
把她带回来
Bring her back.

121
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,620
解决这事
Sort it out.

122
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,190
给他缝缝针
Stitch him up.

123
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,270
把能治的地方都治一治
Fix what you can fix.

124
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,730
你不认为是她做的吗
You don't think she did it?

125
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,670
你觉得是她做的吗
You think she did?

126
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,100
我对她有些了解
I got to know her a little bit.

127
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,010
虽然不是很了解
Not well.

128
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,740
但足以想明白是怎么回事了
Well enough to know what happened.

129
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,780
她看见达里尔当时的处境
She saw Daryl in here, in the state he was in.

130
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,590
就把他放走了
She let him go.

131
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,680
她心软
She was soft.

132
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,400
很善良
She has a big heart.

133
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,660
你被打了一顿扔进牢里...
You were just beaten and thrown in a cell --

134
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,220
要我说的话很冤
unfairly, if you ask me.

135
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,560
而你跟没事人似的
And you're back to it.

136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,990
说不定你以后会为他掌管一个哨站
You may wind up running an outpost for him.

137
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,080
你懂的
You get it.

138
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,470
我觉得我也懂
I like to think that I do.

139
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,630
那种无私  温柔
The type of selfless, tender soul

140
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,360
愿意嫁给尼根以救自己丈夫一命的人
who would marry Negan to save her husband's life?

141
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,780
也正是不应该...
That's exactly the kind of person who really isn't...

142
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,420
活到现在的人
expected to be around anymore.

143
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,470
谢了
Thanks.

144
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,170
只是想帮帮忙而已
Just trying to help.

145
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,570
这里有大家种植的  制造的
Stuff people grow, stuff people make,

146
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,810
以及搜刮的东西
stuff, you know, people scavenge.

147
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,240
啤酒  面包  剪头
Beer, bread, cut your head.

148
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,300
剪什么
Cut your what?

149
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,150
理发师
Barber.

150
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,000
也许能拯救一下你头上那坨东西
Might be able to kill that thing on your head.

151
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,850
我们用的是工分系统
We use a points system.

152
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,880
你现在是我们中的一员了  和他们不一样
You're one of us now, not them.

153
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,270
他们伙食糟糕  我们吃香喝辣
They eat shit, we eat good.

154
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,700
写下你拿了什么  或者让他们做了什么
Write what you took or what they did,

155
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,260
然后写上对应的分数  再签个名
how much it was worth, sign your name.

156
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,240
就这么简单
That's it.

157
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,130
今天一定是你的幸运日  长毛
Must be your lucky day, haircut.

158
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,210
这些是自家做的吗
Are these homemade?

159
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,920
是的
Yeah.

160
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,510
真是不错的手工腌菜
That's some good DIY stuff there.

161
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,650
不...不用了  谢谢
No -- no, thank you.

162
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,190
你想要什么
You want something...

163
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,490
就拿什么  长毛
you take it, haircut.

164
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,810
我们让西蒙过去看一眼
We'll send Simon over to take a peak,

165
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,030
先来软的
sort of good-cop this thing first,

166
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,670
看看有什么效果
see how far we get.

167
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,240
他来了
There he is.

168
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,200
全场焦点
Man of the hour!

169
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,130
过来  大块头
Come on over here, big fella.

170
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,970
别这么没礼貌  混蛋
Don't be rude, asshole.

171
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,200
说"你好"啊
Say hello.

172
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,530
你...好
H-h-hello.

173
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,790
你有名字吗  混蛋
You got a name, asshole?

174
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,400
尤金
Eugene.

175
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,970
轮到我们了
Now us.

176
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,990
你是谁
Who are you?

177
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,440
我是尼根
I'm Negan.

178
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,710
尤金...
Well, Eugene...

179
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,650
我知道你还记得露西尔
I know you remember Lucille.

180
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,610
你看见这里这个东西了吗
Now, you see this right here?

181
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,460
你可能得靠近点仔细看看
You might have to get real close.

182
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,380
我的朋友  那是你造的子弹
That, my friend, is the bullet you made.

183
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,620
在正常情况下
Now, under normal circumstances,

184
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,230
我会一遍又一遍地让你亲密接触它
I'd be showing you that real close over and over again.

185
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,010
但是  尤金  你瞧
But, Eugene, see,

186
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,790
我只想知道你是不是个机灵鬼
all I really want to know is if you are a smarty-pants.

187
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,870
你懂的很多吗
You know things?

188
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,290
回答我
Answer the question.

189
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,350
我...我确实挺机灵的
I -- I am, indeed, a smarty-pants.

190
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,640
我...自学了造子弹
I...taught myself to cast bullets.

191
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,710
我...找到了一个...
I...found a --

192
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,660
找到了一个机械车间
found a machine shop

193
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,640
那里有必需的...
with the necessary...

194
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,150
我读了很多书...
I-I read a lot, and, um...

195
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,220
尽管我...
although my --

196
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,960
尽管我做不到过目不忘
Even though my memory is not considered eidetic,

197
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,510
但我也不会走马观花
I don't skim and I don't scrimp.

198
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,430
假如书上有什么知识
If knowledge is dropped,

199
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,230
我就会学会
I do, indeed, pick it up.

200
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,110
你真的只是个混蛋而已
Oh, you really are just some asshole.

201
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,280
不  我不是
N-no. I'm not.

202
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,040
我有好几个生物化学
I have PHDs in biochemistry,

203
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,530
以及免疫学与微生物学博士学位
as well as immunology and microbiology,

204
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,110
我完成了博士学业  是货真价实的博士
and I've completed my doctorate, which makes me a doctor.

205
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,740
S05E01中尤金曾撒过同样的谎

206
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,020
灾变之前
Prior to the collapse,

207
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,740
我是人类基因组计划十人小组的成员
I was part of a 10-person team at the human genome project,

208
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,020
受布鲁克斯・埃利斯博士领导
working under Dr. T. Brooks Ellis

209
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,460
研制对抗病毒武器的病毒武器
to weaponize diseases to fight weaponized diseases.

210
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,820
以毒...攻毒
Fire with, uh... You know...fire.

211
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,180
不同部门间喝过酒...
Well, see, interdepartmental drinks were --

212
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,260
好吧  机灵鬼博士
All right, Dr. Smarty-pants.

213
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,250
你应该能不费吹灰之力解决这事
You ought to be able to crack this without breaking a sweat.

214
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,740
你看  围栏边我有很多免费劳工
You see, I have a lot of free labor here at the fence,

215
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,300
活死人可以防止其他杂碎进来
living dead pricks that help keep the riffraff out.

216
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,510
问题是它们站不住  总会散架
Problem is, they don't keep. They fall apart.

217
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,810
就像那摊可怜的
Like that poor sack of...

218
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,070
狗屎玩意
pile of shit there.

219
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:30,200
所以  机灵鬼博士
So, Dr. Smarty-Pants,

220
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,640
怎么才能让它们站住
How do we keep them on their feet?

221
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,160
你们
You, um...

222
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,090
经常冶炼  对吗
smelt on the regs, correct?

223
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,490
我看到一堆遗留设备当中
I saw that among the legacy equipment on the floor that

224
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,520
-有可运作的熔炉  -是又怎样
- you possess an operational smelter.  - And?

225
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,460
你们已经掌握了解决问题的办法
You already possess the means to resolve your issue.

226
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,660
第一步  熔化金属废料
Step one, melt down scrap metal.

227
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,080
第二步  铁链拴住行尸
Step two, pour it over the compromised walker

228
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,330
把金属液浇到它们身上
as they are in contact with the chain link.

229
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,160
液态金属会变硬
The liquid metal will harden...

230
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,530
既可以保持行尸身体完整
Both maintaining bodily integrity for the walker

231
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,210
又可以把它们粘在围栏上
as well as affixing them to the fence.

232
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,250
更棒的是遮盖了它们的头部
Bonus points for covering their head

233
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,590
防止敌人攻击或意外导致脑袋碎裂
and protecting them from head trauma from hostiles and calamities.

234
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,480
靠
God damn!

235
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,940
这是我这辈子听过的最酷的主意
If that ain't the coolest thing I've ever heard in my life!

236
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,590
不但可行  而且霸气
Not only is that practical, it is just bad-ass!

237
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,020
看看你  机灵鬼博士
Look at you, Dr. Smarty-pants.

238
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,570
瑞克有没有让你替他做这些有意义的事
Did Rick have you doing this kind of valuable stuff for him?

239
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,720
他亏了  我们赚了
His loss, our gain.

240
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,050
我觉得应该给你签约奖金
I feel like I need to give you some kind of signing bonus here.

241
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,440
我已经得到了腌黄瓜
Uh, w-well, I wa-- I was gifted these pickles.

242
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,050
不
No.

243
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,830
作为对你的答谢
As a token of my gratitude,

244
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,730
我要送我的老婆们
I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives

245
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,280
到你房间去  让你乐一乐
to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.

246
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,450
现在我不用担心这事了
Now, I don't think I have to worry about this.

247
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,960
但谁又知道你到底有多聪明呢
But who knows how truly smart you are?

248
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,480
不准上床
No sex.

249
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,000
那是禁区
That is a grave no-no.

250
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,630
但你可以吃顿惬意的晚餐
However, you can have a little dinner,

251
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,810
喝喝小酒  乐呵乐呵
some drinks, share a few laughs.

252
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,830
没什么比漂亮妞的体香
There is nothing like beautiful women that smell good

253
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,590
更让你觉得自己又像个人了
to make you feel human again.

254
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,820
这方面我完全不了解
I wouldn't know anything about that.

255
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,490
你刚才说"老婆们"  是指有很多吗
D-d-did you say "Wives", meaning plural?

256
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,720
正是
Hell yes, I did.

257
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,620
机灵鬼博士要对
What does Dr. Smarty-pants say

258
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,880
他在世界上最好的新朋友说什么吗
to his new bestest friend in the whole wide world?

259
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,240
要说什么吗
What does he say?

260
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,820
谢谢
Thank you.

261
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,110
非常地  完全地
Fully, completely...

262
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,610
诚心地  认真地感谢你
Sincerely, seriously...Thank you.

263
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,130
好吧
Okay.

264
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,110
去找点乐子吧
Why don't you go have some fun?

265
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,470
这是什么鬼东西
What the hell am I even looking at?

266
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,180
类似小虫子的生物叫亚尔
The insect-like creature is called Yar.

267
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,120
它们试图报复
It is attempting to exact revenge

268
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,820
恶魔昆塔  因为它摧毁了拉扎克四
upon the evil Qotile for the destruction of Razak IV.

269
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,880
也许你该放松点  安珀
Maybe you should take it easy, Amber.

270
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,210
也许我不应该  弗兰基
Maybe I shouldn't, Frankie.

271
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,980
我们可以玩点别的
Uh, we could play something else.

272
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,100
战神
Warlords?

273
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,410
可以四个人玩  很有趣
It's four-player and quite the hoot.

274
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,780
你想玩什么都行
Whatever you want.

275
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,030
今晚为你服务
This is your night.

276
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,510
想来个按摩吗
Do you want a massage?

277
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,950
尼根很喜欢
Negan loves them.

278
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,860
我是认证按摩师
And I was a licensed therapist.

279
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,960
以前是
You know, before.

280
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,420
感谢你的好意
While I appreciate the gesture

281
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,040
还有你对指定对象的认真精神
and your commitment to your assigned objective,

282
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,480
我非常清楚今晚你们没有一位是
I am fully aware that none of you ladies are here this evening

283
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
出于自愿来的
of your own volition.

284
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,390
电子游戏是我唯一可以展示给你们的乐子
Video games are all about me showing all of you a fun time.

285
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,600
还想再吃点微波炉爆米花吗
Would you care for more microwave popcorn?

286
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,170
虽然这是尼根的主意
Hey, just because this was Negan's idea

287
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,380
但不意味着我们不愿意来
doesn't mean that we don't want to be here.

288
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,190
只要有理性谈话  我就愿意来
I'd be down with just having an intelligent conversation.

289
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,050
我想在目前的情况下
Well, I suppose a conversation would be acceptable

290
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,330
谈话是可以接受的
under the current circumstance.

291
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,180
你们想谈什么
What would you like to talk about?

292
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,820
人类基因组计划怎么样
Uh, how about the human genome project?

293
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,360
我可以聊一整晚这玩意
I could talk about that shit all night.

294
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,860
说实话
In truth...

295
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,430
我在人类基因组计划中的主要工作
The bulk of my work for the HGP

296
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,670
属于黑盒子项目的一部分
fell under the auspices of the black box program,

297
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,070
而我无权谈论此事
of which I am not at liberty to discuss.

298
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,160
就算我可以
In all likelihood, even if I could,

299
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,690
你们也很可能无法理解
it'd probably escape your comprehension.

300
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,490
他刚侮辱了我们吗  塔尼娅
Did he just insult us, Tanya?

301
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,420
这不是侮辱
It was not a dis.

302
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,520
仅仅是陈述事实
It was simply a statement of fact.

303
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,950
我的智商经历过客观测量
My intelligence has been objectively measured.

304
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,480
我是个鹤立鸡群的人
I am fully a man apart.

305
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,820
那你就是那种能用漂白剂
So, what, are you, like, one of those guys who can make a bomb

306
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,100
和牙签什么的做炸弹的人咯
out of bleach and a toothpick or something?

307
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,410
当然不是
Of course not.

308
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,110
那至少需要干酵母  过氧化氢
That would at least require dry yeast, hydrogen peroxide,

309
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,700
少量洗洁精
and a small amount of liquid dish soap,

310
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,820
也许还要一些洁厕灵或者通渠剂
maybe some, you know, bathroom or drain cleaner,

311
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,800
一些气球之类的
some balloons or something like that,

312
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,130
再加一些常见的生活用品
few other common household sundries.

313
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,160
真的吗
Seriously?

314
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,420
千真万确
Serious as sepsis.

315
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,110
真的吗
Seriously?

316
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,640
真蠢
So stupid.

317
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,110
我希望这能展现我的聪明
I'm hoping to illustrate the opposite.

318
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,740
只是奴隶吗
Just slaves?

319
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,740
你说什么
Excuse me?

320
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,010
随便了
Whatever.

321
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,600
尤金博士  你刚用厕所里的东西制造了氦气吗
Dr. Eugene, did you just make helium out of toilet stuff?

322
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,320
是氢气
Hydrogen.

323
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,280
没事  基诺
It's cool, Keno.

324
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,200
我们没事
We're good.

325
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,700
放松
Relax.

326
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,310
你是我们中的一员了
You're one of us.

327
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,320
我应该提前说明
I should disclose in advance

328
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,590
我将其归类为炸弹也许是有点说大话
I may have oversold this one by classifying it as a bomb.

329
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,690
过氧化氢分解时
As the hydrogen peroxide decomposes,

330
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,860
这一反应会以放热的形式释放能量
the reaction will release energy in the form of heat.

331
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,580
尤金博士  你能给我们看点精彩的吗
Dr. Eugene, can you please just show us some good shit?

332
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,520
我要点燃这根蜡烛
I'm gonna light this candle.

333
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,180
-真酷  -终于
- Cool! - Finally.

334
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,670
不  我是说  我要点燃这根蜡烛
No, I mean, I'm gonna light this candle.

335
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,860
不
Oh, no.

336
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,930
耶
Yay!

337
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,700
好棒
Yeah!

338
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,760
好棒
Yeah!

339
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,310
亲爱的
Honey?

340
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,820
D  我们总是说如果我们分开了
D -- we always said that if we got separated,

341
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,390
我应该回到这里等你
I should come back here and wait for you.

342
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,230
你会带着啤酒和椒盐脆饼出现
You'd show up with beer and pretzels.

343
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,540
记得吗
You remember that?

344
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,360
我知道
I know.

345
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,080
你也许不记得了
You probably don't.

346
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,070
你总说我们开始约会时
You always said that when we started dating,

347
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,920
你忘记告诉我你记性很差了
you forgot to tell me you had a shitty memory.

348
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,550
你以前会因此很沮丧
You used to get so frustrated by it...

349
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,200
知道你不会记得那些好时光
knowing you wouldn't remember those good days...

350
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,720
特别的日子
those special days.

351
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,300
喂金鱼  爱你的雪莉
快走

352
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,140
我为你感到难过
I felt bad for you.

353
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,440
我记得你说过
I remember you said

354
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,050
你有许多想记住的事
there was so much you wanted to hold on to,

355
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,330
但你就这样忘了
and then it'd be gone.

356
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,950
但你很幸运你记性不好  D
But you're lucky you don't remember things, D.

357
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,390
真希望我现在能等你
I wish I could wait for you now.

358
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,560
但我不知道你会跟我走
But I don't know if you'd come with me

359
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,760
还是带我回去
Or if you'd take me back there

360
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,040
还是杀了我
Or you'd kill me.

361
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,510
你不想活在那个世界里
You didn't want to live in that world,

362
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,890
是我逼你的
and I made you.

363
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,530
我那样做是因为我不想让你死
I did what I did because I didn't want you to die.

364
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,790
但现在你杀人了
But now you've killed,

365
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,250
成为了你不想成为的人 
and you've become everything you didn't want to be,

366
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,420
这是我的错
And it's my fault.

367
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,050
你比我更好
You were better than me.

368
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,970
大部分人都是
Most people are.

369
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,780
我放达里尔走
I let Daryl go

370
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,820
因为他让你想起了以前的自己
Because he reminded you of who you used to be.

371
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,080
而我想让你忘掉
And I wanted to let you forget.

372
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,840
我不觉得自己能在外面活下去
I don't think I'm gonna make it out here,

373
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,120
但你错了
but you're wrong.

374
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,020
在那里并不比死了更好
Being there isn't better than being dead.

375
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,180
而是更糟
It's worse.

376
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,130
我希望你能明白
I hope you realize that,

377
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,730
希望你能离开那
and I hope you get away.

378
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,640
我希望你记得那些美好的时光
I hope you remember the good days,

379
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,690
哪怕只记得一点  但是...
even just one of them, but...

380
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,550
我不认为你会想起来
I don't think you will.

381
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,840
你也许根本不会读到这封信
I don't think you'll ever read this.

382
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,780
我爱以前的你
I loved who you were.

383
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,180
很抱歉  我让你变成了现在这样
I'm sorry I made you into who you are.

384
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,820
再见
Goodbye.

385
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,100
亲爱的
Honey.

386
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,640
我们听到你在玩亚尔和昆塔了  尤金
We can hear the Yars and the Qotile, Eugene.

387
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,910
在我的理解里  昨晚的事情
I was given to understand that last night's shinny

388
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,480
应该是单一偶发事件
was supposed to be a singular incident.

389
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,690
不是他叫我们来的
He didn't send us.

390
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,940
我们需要你的帮助
We need your help.

391
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,100
昨晚你看到安珀的样子了
You saw Amber last night.

392
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,110
喝了哭  哭了喝
She just drinks and cries.

393
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,950
她不想做这个
She didn't want this.

394
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,440
我们是自愿的
We signed up for it.

395
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,110
对我们来说更好
It's better for us.

396
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,670
她是被迫的
She had to.

397
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,270
她妈妈需要药
Her mom needed meds.

398
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,460
她又不能干活
She can't work.

399
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,710
安珀本以为
Amber thought...

400
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,750
她可以忍受
that she could live with it.

401
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,960
她做不到
She can't.

402
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,040
她求我们帮她结束这一切
She asked us to help her end it.

403
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,090
你们没有什么
You aren't afforded any...

404
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,520
心理健康辅导可做吗
mental-health services?

405
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,550
没有
No.

406
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,040
-你是认真的吗  -你们有认证女按摩师
- Are you serious? - I mean, there's a licensed masseuse here.

407
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,260
按概率来说  应该...
Uh, odds being what they are --

408
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,000
没有那样的人
There's no one like that here.

409
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,900
只能这样了
So this...is it.

410
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,930
她只是想吃点什么
She just wants to take something.

411
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,190
睡过去  再不醒过来
She wants to go to sleep and not wake up.

412
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,910
那样非常不负责任
That would be wildly irresponsible.

413
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,950
她在睡梦中死去
She dies at night, in her sleep,

414
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,550
变成行尸的时候  其他人都在睡觉
she turns while everyone is asleep...

415
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,710
我们负责处理那部分
We'll handle that part.

416
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,970
我们希望你能帮她做点什么
We were hoping that you could make something for her,

417
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,110
因为我们知道你会做东西
'cause we know that you can make things.

418
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,760
我知道这很疯狂  你也不怎么了解我们
Look, I know that this is crazy and you barely know us...

419
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,480
但是我们知道你是个好人
But we can tell that you are a good man.

420
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,580
现在好人不多了
There aren't many of those left.

421
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,090
事实上  我不是好人
Truth of the matter is, I'm not good.

422
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,180
我不守序  不中立  不叛逆
I'm not lawful, neutral, or chaotic --

423
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,180
《龙与地下城》中道德伦理体系

424
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,460
以上都不是
None of the above.

425
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,750
你是说你不会做是吗
Are you saying you can't do it?

426
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,870
并不是能力缺失的问题
Lack of ability is not the problem here.

427
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,310
我可以用现有的材料
I could jerry-rig a lethal toxin

428
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,940
随意提取出某种致命毒素
with the assets at hand here.

429
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,190
-没问题  我是...  -那就帮帮我们
- No problemo. I have the -- - Then help us.

430
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,730
一片药  一小杯药水  都可以
A pill, a shot, whatever.

431
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,600
我们需要两份
We need two of them.

432
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,180
因为我们不知道什么时候才有机会
'cause we don't know when we could get our chance.

433
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,950
无论我们帮不帮她  她都要寻死的
She's gonna do it, with or without us.

434
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,680
她会很痛苦  或者导致其他人受伤
She'll suffer, and maybe someone else will get hurt.

435
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,050
你是好人  尤金
You are good, Eugene.

436
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,820
你一定要是
You have to be.

437
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,960
她有多重
How much does she weigh?

438
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,410
不知道  一百二吧
Don't know. Maybe...120.

439
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,120
怎么了
Why?

440
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,050
如果你们能告诉我她的准确体重
If you could get me her exact weight,

441
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,830
我可以保证做出半精加工无痛毒药
I could guarantee a semi-precise t.O. Pain-free d.

442
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,250
尽快做出
A.S.A.P.

443
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,700
目前只能这样了
Best I can do for now.

444
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,180
晚点再来吧
Come back later.

445
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,120
我们几个人玩扑克
We're playing poker with some guys.

446
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,870
试着帮你牵线
Try to hook you up.

447
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,000
你在开玩笑吗  玩不了扑克了
You kidding? Can't play poker.

448
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,580
明天早上天一亮
I got to be out diggin' postholes

449
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,800
我就得出去挖坑
at the crack of dawn tomorrow.

450
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,010
我需要一板铝塑包装的
I would like a single blister pack

451
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,800
最强效的感冒胶囊
of your most extra-strength cold capsule.

452
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,230
队是用来排的
The line's a line!

453
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,520
怎么  你老家都不排队吗
What, they not have them where you come from?

454
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,920
你不知道怎么排吗
You don't know how they work?

455
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,410
不  我熟悉...
No, I am familiar --

456
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,040
后面排着去  混蛋
Get in it, prick.

457
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,340
你的编号是多少
What is your number?

458
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,550
你的呢
What's yours?

459
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,100
16
16.

460
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,370
好吧  16号
All right, number 16.

461
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,090
我是尤金・波特博士
My name is Dr. Eugene Porter.

462
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,880
我最近被授予了
I've recently been appointed

463
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,580
这里新设立的首席工程师之职
to the newly created post of chief engineer of this facility.

464
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,860
我直属尼根管理
I report directly to Negan,

465
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,550
这意味着你直属我管理
which means you report directly to my ass.

466
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,580
我要感冒胶囊  快点
The cold capsules, now.

467
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,250
我不知道
I didn't know.

468
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,370
只是  来的新人很多...
We just -- we get so many new faces, I didn't...

469
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,530
这个我也要
I want this, too.

470
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,730
还有这个
And this.

471
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,070
我不知道你管这叫什么
I don't even know what you call this.

472
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,220
我要叫它小黏糊
I'm gonna call it a gremblygunk.

473
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,200
你找到她了吗
Did you find her?

474
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,100
她在哪
Where is she?

475
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,210
我杀了她
I killed her.

476
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,780
她逃向了一群行尸中
She ran away from me right into a mess of dead ones,

477
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,420
所以我...给了她痛快
So, I, uh... Made it quick.

478
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,210
还是会痛
It still hurts.

479
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,650
有绷带好一些
Feels better with a bandage.

480
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,470
我不是说这个
I wasn't talking about that.

481
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,580
我本想告诉你忘了她  但是...
I would tell you to just forget about her, but...

482
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,990
考虑到她做的事情  我不觉得短时间内
...I don't see anyone else doing that anytime soon,

483
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,390
会有人这么做
considering what she did.

484
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,990
我们都做过一些事情
Oh, we've all done things.

485
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,330
是的  但在我们来这里之前
Yes, but before we got here,

486
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,610
在我们懂得之前
Before we understood...

487
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,700
我们像个懦夫
We were cowards about it.

488
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,970
我们...不能留有善良之心
We don't -- we don't get to have big hearts.

489
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,830
记住这一点
Remember that.

490
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,500
这是干什么
Wh-what is this?

491
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,800
你会知道的
You'll find out.

492
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,640
你最好睁眼好好看着
You are gonna want to pay close attention to this.

493
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,370
不
no, no, no, no!

494
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,530
为什么
Why?

495
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,880
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

496
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,530
我发现这个小纪念品
I found this little souvenir

497
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,060
藏在你的桌子里
tucked away in your desk.

498
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,300
再见  亲爱的

499
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,660
我不知道那是什么
I-I-I don't know what that is.

500
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,890
你
You...

501
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,500
开门放走了我的宠物
left the door open and let my puppy out.

502
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,290
你知道雪莉不希望达里尔在这里
You knew Sherry hated Daryl being here,

503
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,200
所以你为她放了他  趁机逞英雄
So you let him out for her, be the hero.

504
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,830
然后你就可以插一脚了
Then you could move in.

505
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,320
你...
That...

506
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,930
真够狡猾
is some weaselly shit right there.

507
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,130
我没这么做  是她自己逃跑的...
But I didn't. She's the one who ran --

508
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,330
她逃跑
Oh, she ran?

509
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,990
你知道为什么她会逃吗
You know why she ran?!

510
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,830
因为她知道我会怪她
Because she knew I would blame her, which...

511
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,820
确实如此
I did.

512
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,890
但是雪莉在她被撕碎之前
But, see, Sherry told Dwighty boy the whole story

513
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,520
告诉了小德整件事的经过
right before she was torn apart.

514
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,790
一个超级辣妹  因为你的
A super hot girl, horrifically killed

515
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,490
痴心妄想和小鸡鸡
Because of your greedy, delusional,

516
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,750
被残忍杀死
and tiny little prick.

517
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,210
这不是真的  德怀特
It's not true. Dwight?

518
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,680
他在撒谎
He's lying about it.

519
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,840
-我决不会这么做  -为什么
- I would never do that. - Why?

520
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,600
为什么  为什么他要撒谎呢
Why? Why would he do that?

521
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,130
为什么他要故意伤害你呢
Why would he intentionally try to hurt you?

522
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,460
雪莉死了
Sherry's gone.

523
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,970
如果他撒了谎
And if he's lying...

524
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,410
她还活着  我会找到她
And she's out there, I will find her.

525
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,380
然后我会烧了他另外半张脸
And then I will burn the other side of his face off

526
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,060
直到他死
until he dies.

527
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,380
他能从中得到什么好处呢
So, what was he gonna get out of this?

528
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,290
不
No.

529
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,710
不
No.

530
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,610
我了解我的小德
You see, I know my Dwighty boy.

531
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,580
他需要的只是
See, all he needed...

532
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,470
在牢房里再被关一晚
was one more night in the hole,

533
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,130
然后脑子就正常了
get his head screwed on straight.

534
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,800
以前管用  现在也管用
It worked before, and it worked now.

535
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,930
是不是啊  德怀特
Ain't that right, Dwight?

536
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,200
是的
Oh, yeah.

537
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,150
求求你
oh, please.

538
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,090
不  求求你
No, please.

539
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,180
求求你
Please, please, please!

540
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,530
天啊  不要烫我
Oh, jesus, don't burn me.

541
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,520
求求你
Please!

542
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,800
求求你
Please!

543
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
不
No.

544
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,250
不  求求你
No, no, please!

545
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,250
你知道我讨厌这样做
Now you know I hate this shit.

546
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,350
只用告诉我是你做的  你很抱歉
Just tell me you did it and that you're sorry,

547
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:03,280
我就不用动手了
And I don't have to do this.

548
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,950
是的
Yes.

549
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,220
是我做的  都是我做的
Yes, I did it -- all of it.

550
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,950
抱歉  我很抱歉
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

551
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,070
求求你
Please...

552
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,550
抱歉
I'm sorry.

553
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,940
这么说就行了
That's all you had to say.

554
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,840
这么说就行了
That is all you had to say.

555
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,300
幸好我们还有个卡森医生
A good thing we got a spare Dr. Carson.

556
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,620
我相信你  小德
I trust you, Dwighty boy.

557
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,770
从来不该怀疑你
Never shoulda doubted you.

558
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,170
雪莉是我最喜欢的女人之一
Sherry was one of my favorites.

559
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,400
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

560
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,660
我不
I'm not.

561
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,650
冷血
Ice-cold.

562
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,040
我喜欢
I love it.

563
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,890
进
Come.

564
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,840
你好
Hello.

565
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,700
你还好吗
Are you all right?

566
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,910
挺好的
Better than that.

567
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,330
你可以下局玩  不过要等一会
You can call next, but it might be a while.

568
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,190
你做药了吗
Did you make the pills?

569
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,060
做了
I did.

570
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,630
但不能给你们
But you can't have them.

571
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,400
安珀指望着我们呢
Amber's counting on us.

572
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,640
我们跟她说你会帮助我们
We told her that you were gonna help us,

573
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,260
-她说她...  -住嘴  红发
- and she says that she -- - Pump your brakes, red.

574
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,870
别侮辱我的智商  弗兰基
Do not insult my intelligence, Frankie.

575
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,750
药不是给安珀的
Said pills aren't for Amber.

576
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,260
药是给尼根的
Said pills are for Negan.

577
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,900
所以你要两份
That's why you wanted two.

578
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,790
他不是杀了你的朋友们吗
Didn't he kill your friends?

579
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,920
杀了好几个
Several.

580
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,320
但我们也杀了他的三十多个人
But I imagine we killed about 30 or so of his.

581
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,680
扯平了
Turnabout and all that.

582
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,120
给我们药  不然我们给尼根告状
Give us the pills, or we'll tell Negan about it.

583
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,550
我们会说做药是你的主意
We'll tell him that it was your idea to make them

584
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,350
你试图劝我们协助你
and that you tried to get us to help.

585
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,900
那会是你的战术错误
That would be a tactical error on your part.

586
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,130
他会信我而不是你
They'll believe me over you

587
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,580
正如他信德怀特而不是医生一样
for the same reason he believed Dwight over the doctor.

588
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,400
你对他来说是可取代的
You're replaceable to him.

589
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,860
另一方面  我则不是
I, on the other hand, am not.

590
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,590
你是个懦夫
You're a coward.

591
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,430
你是个...懦夫
You're...a coward.

592
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,520
这是正确的评价
That is a correct assessment.

593
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,410
我能进来吗
May I come in?

594
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,000
你喜欢这里吗
So, how you liking it here?

595
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,190
我们把机灵鬼博士招待得好吗
Are we doing right by Dr. Smarty-pants?

596
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,830
弗兰基和塔尼娅
You know, Frankie and Tanya...

597
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,520
她们说的都是你的好话
Nothing but good things to say about you.

598
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,520
没关系
It's all right.

599
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,020
我明白
I get it.

600
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,520
我知道接受改变
I know how hard it can be to accept change,

601
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,300
弃暗投明有多难
to get on the right team.

602
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,130
但是我需要你明白一些事
But I need you to understand something.

603
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,340
我不会随意邀请他人
I do not make this invitation to everyone.

604
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,070
我的邀请分量也很重
And I sure as shit do not make it lightly.

605
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:53,310
你不用再害怕了
You do not need to be scared anymore.

606
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:57,060
你不用害怕了
You don't need to be scared.

607
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,130
只用回答我一个问题
You just have to answer me one question.

608
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,300
这是个大问题
And it's a big one.

609
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,350
你是...
Who are --

610
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,520
我是尼根
I'm Negan.

611
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,200
我完完全全  彻头彻尾是尼根
I'm utterly, completely, stone-cold Negan.

612
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,430
遇见你之前我就是尼根了
I was Negan before I even met you.

613
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,550
遇见你之后  我才醒悟
I just needed to meet you properly to know.

614
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,590
我是尼根
I'm Negan.

615
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,020
当心点
Hey, be careful with that.

616
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,390
你想被熔态金属烫到吗
Hey, you want to get burned by molten metal?

617
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,880
因为那样做会被熔态金属烫到的
'cause that's exactly how you get burned by molten metal.

618
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,960
关于我施压...
Regarding me clamping down --

619
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,970
你跟我们一伙吗
You on board?

620
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,990
是的  和你一样
I am. Just like you.

621
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,650
-不知道你是否记得我名字  -不记得
Don't know if you recall my handle -- I don't.

622
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,000
尤金
Eugene.

623
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:18,750
你是德怀特
You're Dwight.

624
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,500
我们都是尼根
We are Negan.

625
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,050
是啊
Yeah.
