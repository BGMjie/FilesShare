2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,240
That true?

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,290
You wanna help?

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,890
- I do. - Okay.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,640
We have to get ready. We have to fight.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,830
We do.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,310
we get you the guns, we fight together.

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,540
- Say yes. - Yes.

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,940
They're out there, so I'm gonna be there with you.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,900
We are.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,830
Package deal.

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,430
You have to get me something.

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,010
A knife, a gun...

14
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,370
This will do it. It's a poison.

Hey, darlin'. Wake up.

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,020
What is it? Do we need to --

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,210
No, no, no. We're okay for now.

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,130
Well, good afternoon to you.

35
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,070
You're here.

36
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,260
Yeah.

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,520
And I'm feelin' all kinds of glad to see you right now.

38
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,330
Are they back?

39
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,900
Not yet.

40
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,330
I know you were pullin' late shift, and you wanna tonight,

41
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,120
so I didn't want to wake you up.

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,170
Maggie's in trouble.

43
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,380
What?

44
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,920
Something with the baby.

45
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,870
Rick's taking her to the doctor at Hilltop.

46
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,880
He doesn't know it yet, but I'm going with him.

47
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,100
I just...

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,520
I know we just started this,

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,290
- but I wanted you to -- Don't.

50
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,730
"Don't" what?

51
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,930
Don't go.

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life, Sasha.

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,700
You are gonna help make sure things get back on track today.

54
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,780
You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit,

55
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,600
and you don't suffer one goddamn fool.

56
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,850
No one's gonna wanna watch you die.

57
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,970
I don't wanna see that.

58
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,680
So you don't have to.

59
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,490
But someone does.

60
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,870
Maybe a couple others -- tops.

61
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,460
But not you and not most people.

62
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,030
We are gonna help solve some shit.

63
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,110
Tuck in.

64
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,280
Big day.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,960
What do you need from me?

66
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,690
Look at me.

67
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,640
Why?

68
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,510
'Cause I want it stopped.

69
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,050
I want Negan dead.

70
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,070
So why don't you kill him?

71
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,690
Can't just be me.

72
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,560
They're all Negan.

73
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,150
That girl you murdered...

74
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,660
She had a name.

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,020
Her name was Denise, and she was a doctor.

76
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,930
And she helped people.

77
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,850
I wasn't aiming for her.

78
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,390
Do it. Do it.

79
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,000
You wanna end it this way...

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,260
You go ahead.

81
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm sorry. I am.

82
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,840
I know you want to.

83
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,760
He could just be here to see if you were here.

84
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,670
We can't trust him.

85
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,220
He owned me.

86
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,880
But not anymore.

87
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,720
What I did,

88
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,560
I was doing it for someone else.

89
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,580
She just got away.

90
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,610
So now I'm here.

91
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,080
So are you because of her?

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,800
Do it!

93
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,800
There's another choice.

94
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,210
Daryl.

95
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,880
- Daryl, you knew her. - Negan trusts me.

96
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,120
We can work together, we can stop him.

97
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,910
You knew me then, and you know me now.

98
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,240
You know I'm not lying.

99
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm not.

100
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,090
Do it.

101
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,930
Do it!

102
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,880
They have Sasha, if she's even alive.

103
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,550
Why didn't you say something?

104
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,270
He could be our only chance to get her back.

105
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,200
Because I don't trust him.

106
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,170
But I trust Daryl.

107
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,420
Negan's coming soon.

108
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,870
Tomorrow.

109
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,590
Three trucks probably.

110
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,580
20 saviors and him.

111
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,730
I can slow them down,

112
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,560
bring some trees down in the road,

113
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,490
buy a little time for you guys to get ready.

114
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,710
If you can take them out, that's where we start.

115
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,520
You kill them, I'll radio back to the sanctuary.

116
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,270
The sanctuary?

117
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,640
Where negan lives.

118
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,910
That's what they call it.

119
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,780
I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.

120
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,940
You drive the trucks back,

121
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,480
and I can lead you right inside,

122
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,060
and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.

123
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,560
Check to see if your friend's still alive.

124
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,910
Then, we get the workers on our side,

125
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,680
build our numbers up,

126
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,150
and go from outpost to outpost and end this.

127
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,390
Keep talking.

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,550
We just started it -- the whole thing.

129
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,820
If he's lyin', I'm gonna kill him real slow.

130
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,070
When this is done,

131
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,860
I don't give a damn if he's sorry.

132
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,490
I will kill that son of a bitch.

133
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,040
If he's lying,

134
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,680
this is already over.

135
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Oh, I gotta go.

136
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,420
Oh, I gotta go.

137
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,150
Fact is, I figured we'd --

138
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,540
I had a dream.

139
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,830
You...

140
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,980
You had a dream about me?

141
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,490
You died.

142
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,740
That's the plan.

143
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,240
That's what I need from you.

144
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,940
And when you come out, not a peep.

145
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,620
They will stand down, if they haven't already.

146
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,930
And then, Lucille here, well, she gets her three,

147
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,930
and we move forward with a new understanding.

148
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,320
Are you -- are you shitting me?

149
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,390
Is that real?

150
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,090
I can do it, but no one has to die.

151
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,510
You are wrong.

152
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,890
Punishment --

153
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,360
Can't do anything without that.

154
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,770
Punishment is how we built everything we have.

155
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,530
You think I'm gonna sit here and let you...

156
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,750
Careful!

157
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,500
You are not letting me do anything.

158
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,820
No one has to die.

159
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,130
Okay.

160
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,940
How about this?

161
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,070
One.

162
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,610
Just one.

163
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,130
I mean, I was gonna pull three outta the pool,

164
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,890
but just one,

165
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,100
and just for you.

166
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,050
Okay.

167
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,180
Just one person has to die.

168
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,820
You got me wrapped around your little finger.

169
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,060
You know that?

170
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,380
And it's not a man woman thing.

171
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,560
I mean, if you had a dick,

172
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,320
I would still have these feelings.

173
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,780
We roll out in 45.

174
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,520
So we don't have Oceanside, but we have their guns.

175
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,560
Negan has Sasha.

176
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,940
Daryl wants us to trust Dwight.

177
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,340
Rick wants us to stay here in case things go wrong

178
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,230
so there's another card to play,

179
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,950
another safe place the Saviors think they control.

180
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,180
But he doesn't know that Gregory's gone...

181
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,720
That maybe he's telling them things,

182
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,470
that'll make them think something else.

183
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,730
And it's all about to happen.

184
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,690
You're thinking of leading the Hilltop over there to fight.

185
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,860
I am.

186
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,020
If Negan finds out they're planning something,

187
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,490
they're gonna need help,

188
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,980
Even with those scavengers on their side.

189
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,370
Well, you'd have to decide right now,

190
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,100
and it's a very tough decision.

191
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,420
Why are you smiling?

192
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,940
'cause I'm glad you're the one making it for us.

193
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
How do I?

194
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,650
I don't know.

195
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,350
I just know you can.

196
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,980
Let me take her.

197
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,630
You take this.

198
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,920
Guns up, now.

199
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,310
What the hell? He's dead.

200
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,940
What is it?

201
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,300
We've seen this before.

202
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,690
Same ones.

203
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,720
Dude, you okay?

204
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,030
- You're gonna ambush them on your own? - Yeah.

205
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,850
Going alone doesn't work for this.

206
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,920
It works for me.

207
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,310
Have you killed any of them?

208
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,770
Because if you have and they've found out,

209
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,860
they may think it was the Kingdom,

210
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,880
and we lose our advantage.

211
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,650
It's from walkers.

212
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,840
Can we move them aside?

213
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,580
Do you seek to extinguish everything of who you were?

214
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,940
I don't seek it, but...

215
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,980
I'm stuck.

216
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,090
You want the Saviors dead?

217
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,890
- Morgan. - Yes, I do.

218
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,480
Cease this folly.

219
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,450
Accompany my regiment.

220
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,270
The Saviors are a dragon with many heads,

221
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,140
their numbers legion.

222
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,680
We must seek allies in this endeavor.

223
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
That's Benjamin's armor.

224
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,950
Do you wear it to serve you, or do you wear it in his honor?

225
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,690
Morgan...

Join us on this journey to create an alliance.

232
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,900
Fight with us,

233
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,780
and we shall defeat them so that no one will suffer

234
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,070
under their capricious malevolence ever again.

235
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,700
And we start once more for the fallen...

236
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,840
for the Kingdom...

237
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,190
...for the glory of victory.

238
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,040
What you fight for.

239
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,470
Not the place -- the people, each other.

240
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,300
You're a part of that now.

241
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,100
We take. We don't bother --our way.

242
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,890
Maybe another way.

243
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
Yours?

244
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,020
Yeah, we're together.

245
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,850
I lay with him after.

246
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,760
You care?

247
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,600
- We should get back to work. - Yeah.

248
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,790
Think this was them?

249
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,230
Crossed my mind.

250
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,210
We got a plan "B."

251
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,000
If I might be so bold...

252
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,390
this unexpected stoppage has given me

253
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,420
the chance for an exhaustive mull.

254
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,470
Now, given the loaded circumstances

255
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,720
and potential for casualties and resource expenditure,

256
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,870
I was wondering if you would give me the opportunity

257
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,210
to attempt to slow their jets and cool their roll.

258
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,280
You shoot one of these before?

259
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,190
Good.

260
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,690
Worry?

261
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,140
No.

262
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,800
Good.

263
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,500
- I'll be on the next one over. - Why?

264
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,420
It's more sight lines if we split up.

265
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,520
I'll go.

266
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,030
You sure?

267
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,410
Okay.

268
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,060
We win.

269
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,100
Yeah.

270
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,180
You know what's gonna happen,

271
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,350
How this is gonna end.

272
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,590
You know what's gonna happen,

273
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,640
How this is gonna end.

274
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,690
We're gonna walk out that door together.

275
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,420
We kick shit and eat snakes.

276
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,150
- That's us. - We can sit this one out.

277
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,420
They need us here, anyway.

278
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,060
Rick said to get ready for a fight.

279
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,200
How'd I die?

280
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,150
We were at the beach.

281
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,030
It was before.

282
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,910
You got pulled under...

283
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,430
And you didn't come back up.

284
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,050
I was trying to find you, but you were gone.

285
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,970
And then, I started to drown.

286
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,570
I hate the beach.

287
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,390
End of the day in a wet suit?

288
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,700
It's like you're sandblasting your nutsack

289
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,120
every single step you take back to the car.

290
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,350
Luckily, the seaside ain't on the agenda today.

291
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,550
Just security and some road to chew.

292
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,780
All right? So, come on.

293
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,810
- Let's go help Maggie. - Abraham.

294
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,250
What?

295
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,330
They can use us here.

296
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,890
Just once, we sit one out.

297
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,890
- Someone else -- - it should be us.

298
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,890
Maggie's gotta take care of maggie.

299
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,900
Have you, uh, changed your mind

300
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,120
about taking that allergy medication?

301
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,230
- Yes. - Good.

302
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,850
I think you'll get adjusted to the place, sinus-wise.

303
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,230
No, I won't.

304
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,100
Not like you.

305
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,600
Everyone has a way out.

306
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,420
Don't go and yuck my yum for takin' mine,

307
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,440
which, I may add, is the same as yours now.

308
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,140
If people die today, it's 'cause of the choices they made.

309
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,590
Yeah. It is.

310
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,140
Why are we here?

311
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,490
For this.

312
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,360
Rosita.

313
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,520
Get into position.

314
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,510
I'll signal you.

315
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,920
And the wall's gonna hold?

316
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,290
It'll hold.

317
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,700
All points are covered.

318
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,980
Every contingency is already met.

319
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,740
I come armed with two barrels of the truth.

320
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,830
A test is upon you, and I'm giving out the cheat sheet.

321
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,340
H-hello.

322
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,680
I come salved with the hope that it is my dropped knowledge that you heed.

323
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,990
Options are zero to none.

324
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,150
Compliance and fealty are your only escape.

325
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,040
Bottom-lining it -- you may thrive, or you may die.

326
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,020
I sincerely wish for the former

327
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,930
For everyone's sake.

328
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,640
The jig is up and in full effect.

329
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,450
Will you comply, rick?

330
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,110
Where's Negan?

331
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,560
I'm Negan.

332
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,290
No.

333
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,300
We win.

334
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,510
You ever hear the one about the stupid little prick named rick

335
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,370
who thought he knew shit but didn't know shit

336
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,350
and got everyone he that gave a shit about killed?

337
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,780
It's about you.

338
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,490
You're all gonna wanna put your guns down now.

339
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,400
No one drops anything.

340
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,890
We had a deal.

341
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,730
Tamiel came for the boat things.

342
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,730
Followed ones who took.

343
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,820
Made a better deal.

344
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:32,410
You push me, and you push me. And you push me, Rick.

345
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,090
You just tried to blow us up, right?

346
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,210
I mean, I get me, my people.

347
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,800
But Eugene?

348
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,230
He's one of yours.

349
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,610
And after what he did -- he stepped up.

350
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,490
You people...

351
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,770
are animals.

352
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,340
Universe gives you a sign, and you just

353
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,840
shove your finger right up its ass.

354
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,810
Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.

355
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,340
So, you don't like Eugene anymore.

356
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,740
You guys gotta like Sasha.

357
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,520
I do, too.

358
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Got her right here packaged for your convenience,

359
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,710
alive and well.

360
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,440
Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you,

361
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,360
and not killing all of you could get complicated.

362
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,890
See, I know there's a lot of firepower left in there, Rick.

363
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,560
So I'm gonna make this simple.

364
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,440
I want all the guns you've managed to scrape up.

365
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,970
Yep, I know about those, too.

366
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,330
I want every last grain of lemonade you got left.

367
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,030
I want a person of your own choosing...

368
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,320
For Lucille.

369
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,960
Daryl --

370
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,390
Ooh, I gotta get me my Daryl back.

371
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,760
I see you.

372
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,170
And the pool table

373
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,850
and all the pool cues and chalk.

374
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,620
And I want it now

375
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,550
or Sasha dies,

376
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,580
And then all of you.

377
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,710
Probably.

378
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,300
C'mon, Rick.

379
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,720
Just because I brought her in a casket

380
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,270
doesn't mean she has to leave in it.

381
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,910
You know what?

382
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,490
You suck ass, Rick.

383
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,990
You really do.

384
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,820
I don't want to have to kill her,

385
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,330
but that's exactly what you're gonna make me do.

386
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,600
Let me see her.

387
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,150
All right. Just give me a second.

388
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,690
I might have to get her up to speed.

389
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,240
You can't hear shit inside this thing.

390
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,960
Sash.

391
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,880
You're not gonna believe this crap.

392
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,740
It felt real.

393
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,030
It felt real.

394
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,570
Like we lost this.

395
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,060
And this just started.

396
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,690
- C'mon. - Wait.

397
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,870
I like the way you call bullshit.

398
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,640
So let me return the favor.

399
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,070
The next thing you're gonna tell me

400
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,580
is that you'll go and that I can stay.

401
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,380
Because I know you didn't like hearing yourself just say

402
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,560
that, "Maggie's gotta take care of Maggie."

403
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,970
I know those words are gonna choke in your ears

404
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,160
a good, long while

405
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,640
and you're gonna wanna make up for even thinking that.

406
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,980
Am I right?

407
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,630
Yeah.

408
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:47,160
We lay our big meaties across the chopping block ahead of someone else's.

409
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,000
It's always for someone else.

410
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,160
Both of us know, if we're gonna kick,

411
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,620
there sure as hell better be a point to it.

412
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,270
So maybe we feel there was a-a point to all of this.

413
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,380
Alpha to omega.

414
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,100
Whether it's on the battlefield or the beach

415
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,730
or somewhere out there today.

416
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,970
Maggie --

417
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,420
She's carrying the future.

418
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,330
You're right.

419
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,710
I knew how this was gonna end.

420
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,420
C'mon.

421
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,060
Layin' your ass on the line for someone else,

422
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,090
Tearin' it to shreds for 'em --

423
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,600
You said it before.

424
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,760
Oh, my, that is living.

425
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,860
You're an idiot.

426
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,360
I never said otherwise.

427
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,280
A couple hours to get there, right?

428
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,720
At least.

429
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,190
Might be a circuitous and janky route.

430
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,050
With what they're planning, they could be watching the roads.

431
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,750
"What they're planning."

432
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,120
That's right.

433
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,370
Got it in the marketplace. It's chock-full.

434
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,790
Doubt conversation will be on tap for the commute.

435
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,260
And though I am a selfish coward,

436
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,600
I do tend to think of other people on occasion.

437
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,400
Please take it with my compliments.

438
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,710
I truly wish I measured up.

439
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,190
You still can, Eugene.

440
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,450
I'm not giving up.

441
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,790
Not on you.

442
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,260
Jesus, you don't have to take the trip in the thing.

443
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,940
I could use the rest.

444
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,310
No shit?

445
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,790
Yeah.

446
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,300
I just want to go to sleep.

447
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,850
I just need a little bottle of water, and I'm fine.

448
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,280
Arat?

449
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,490
Listen...

450
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
I know how tough this is.

451
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,800
And I appreciate it.

452
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,360
Damn, you are something else.

453
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,460
Sash.

454
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,290
You're not gonna believe this crap.

455
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,410
Holy goddamn!

456
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,230
Go! Go!

457
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,240
No.

458
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,650
Aah! honey, god damn it!

459
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,050
Plan "B" It is!

460
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,190
Down. Now.

461
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,570
We can make another deal.

462
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,370
I said, down.

463
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,470
Hello again.

464
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,940
Down. Or again.

465
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,200
Well, shit, Rick.

466
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,670
You just couldn't stick with us, huh?

467
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,980
You had to go with these filthy garbage people?

468
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,190
No offense.

469
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,380
Deal is for 12, yes?

470
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,720
10.

471
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,850
People are a resource.

472
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,060
12.

473
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:54,760
10.

474
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,710
Rick.

475
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,850
This is just gonna make you sad.

476
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,110
Broken.

477
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,210
You're gonna wish you were dead.

478
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,550
I like having fun.

479
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,530
I do.

480
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,550
But maybe you think that the guy that did what he did to your friends wasn't me,

481
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:30,200
like that was some sort of a put-on,

482
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,210
like I'm not the guy with the bat --

483
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,120
I'm just the guy that makes your kid spaghetti.

484
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,290
Oh, shit.

485
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,200
Maybe this is on me.

486
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,910
Maybe this is all on me.

487
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,070
I gotta make it right.

488
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,840
I guess I gotta start all over again.

489
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,180
I gotta tell you, Rick,

490
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,640
if I had a kid,

491
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:05,250
I'd want him to be just like your kid,

492
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,820
which makes this so much harder.

493
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,660
You're not gonna win.

494
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,930
Carl.

495
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,480
It is over.

496
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,490
Why don't you point your one ball

497
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,350
up the street there and take it all in?

498
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,210
We'll win!

499
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,360
We live!

500
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,630
We're the ones!

501
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,180
Us!

502
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:13,750
You just lost somebody important to you right now -- like, just now.

503
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,030
Jesus.

504
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,540
That is timing.

505
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,410
Well, Rick...

506
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,500
you chose this.

507
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,300
I truly don't know what more I could've done to warn you.

508
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,390
And this isn't a warning.

509
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,450
This is punishment.

510
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,120
I'm gonna kill Carl now.

511
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,970
I'm gonna make it one nice, hard swing,

512
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:50,630
try to do it in one because I like him.

513
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,480
I just want you to put that in your brain

514
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,890
and roll it around for a minute.

515
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,350
I'm gonna kill Carl, and then Lucille here,

516
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,420
she's gonna take your hands.

517
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,380
You can do it right in front of me.

518
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,960
You can take my hands.

519
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,830
I told you already --

520
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,510
I'm gonna kill you.

521
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,740
All of you.

522
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,220
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow...

523
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,230
but nothing is gonna change that --

524
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,170
Nothing.

525
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,780
You're all already dead.

526
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:54,770
Damn.

527
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Wow, Rick.

528
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,950
Okay.

529
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,990
You said I could do it.

530
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,890
End these Saviors and their accomplices!

531
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,290
Alexandria will not fall, not on this day!

532
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,370
Phalanx out, third group, now!

533
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,570
Move up! Now we got your backs!

534
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,740
A goddamn tiger!

535
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,040
That widow is alive, guns a-blazin'!

536
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,650
You taste that, Simon? That is the taste of shit!

537
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,660
They're falling back.

538
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,330
Eduardo, Bertie, between the houses --

539
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,430
Cover the gate!

540
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,840
Let's go.

541
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,300
Now we finish this!

542
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,420
Now!

543
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,670
Pull! ?

544
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,150
Michonne.

545
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,200
Michonne. ?

546
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,470
Oh, you're alive.

547
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,870
We -- W-We're...

548
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,020
We're...

549
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,050
I know. I know. ?

550
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,760
I know.

551
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,390
We are.

552
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,710
We will.

553
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,300
Getting preparations in place.

554
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,750
Everyone's on "Blue level."

555
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,760
You say the word, they're ready to go.

556
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,700
That's good.

557
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,530
How the hell do you think she wound up dead in that box?

558
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,600
My, um, best possible posit fingers the tarp.

559
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,310
That sealed up said box good and tight.

560
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,410
She ran out of air.

561
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,670
Maybe.

562
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,220
So...

563
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,050
we are going to war!

564
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,780
Yes, sir!

565
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,940
Do you think Sasha did that herself?

566
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,250
I don't know how, but I know she did.

567
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,880
She gave us a chance. You did.

568
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,320
You made the right decision to come.

569
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,290
The decision was made a long time ago,

570
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,560
before any of us knew each other,

571
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,040
when we were all strangers who would have just passed each other on the street

572
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,870
before the world ended.

573
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,220
And now we mean everything to each other.

574
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,410
You were in trouble. You were trapped.

575
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,730
Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.

576
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,770
He put himself in danger for you.

577
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,340
And that started it all --

578
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,280
From Atlanta, to my daddy's farm,

579
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,700
to the prison,

580
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,170
to here...

581
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,040
to this moment now...

582
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,900
not as strangers --

583
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,040
as family...

584
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:25,600
because Glenn chose to be there for you that day

585
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,280
a long time ago.

586
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,000
That was the decision that changed everything.

587
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,970
It started with both of you,

588
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,800
and it just grew...

589
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,470
to all of us...

590
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,440
to sacrifice for each other...

591
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,430
to suffer and stand,

592
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,190
to grieve, to give,

593
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:21,240
to love, to live...

594
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,540
to fight for each other.

595
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,300
Glenn made the decision, Rick.

596
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,800
I was just following his lead.
