00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,900
还没
Not yet.

56
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,330
我知道你最近上夜班  今晚也是
I know you were pullin' late shift, and you wanna tonight,

57
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,120
所以我不想吵醒你
so I didn't want to wake you up.

58
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,170
玛姬有麻烦了
Maggie's in trouble.

59
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,380
什么
What?

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,920
孩子出了问题
Something with the baby.

61
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,870
瑞克要带她去找山顶寨的医生
Rick's taking her to the doctor at Hilltop.

62
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,880
他还不知道  但我要跟他去
He doesn't know it yet, but I'm going with him.

63
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,100
我只是
I just...

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,520
我知道我们才刚开始
I know we just started this,

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,290
-但我希望你...  -别
- but I wanted you to -- Don't.

66
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,730
别什么
"Don't" what?

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,930
别走
Don't go.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
欢迎来到你余生的第一天  萨沙
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life, Sasha.

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,700
你今天要帮我确保一切回到正轨
You are gonna help make sure things get back on track today.

70
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,780
你聪明性感  尊严高尚
You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit,

71
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,600
眼里容不得蠢货
and you don't suffer one goddamn fool.

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,850
没人想看你死
No one's gonna wanna watch you die.

73
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,970
我就不想
I don't wanna see that.

74
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,680
所以你没必要死
So you don't have to.

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,490
但总得有人死
But someone does.

76
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,870
最多几个人
Maybe a couple others -- tops.

77
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,460
但你不用死  大部分人也不用死
But not you and not most people.

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,030
我们要解决一些问题
We are gonna help solve some shit.

79
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,110
尽情吃吧
Tuck in.

80
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,280
今天是个大日子
Big day.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,960
你需要我做什么
What do you need from me?

82
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,690
看着我
Look at me.

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,640
为什么
Why?

84
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,510
因为我想阻止这一切
'Cause I want it stopped.

85
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,050
我要尼根死
I want Negan dead.

86
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,070
那你为什么不杀他
So why don't you kill him?

87
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,690
我一个人做不到
Can't just be me.

88
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,560
他们都是尼根
They're all Negan.

89
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,150
你谋杀的那个女孩
That girl you murdered...

90
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,660
她有名字
She had a name.

91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,020
她叫丹妮斯  是一名医生
Her name was Denise, and she was a doctor.

92
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,930
她救助了很多人
And she helped people.

93
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,850
我瞄的不是她
I wasn't aiming for her.

94
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,390
动手  动手
Do it. Do it.

95
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,000
你想这样结束
You wanna end it this way...

96
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,260
随便你
You go ahead.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,560
我很抱歉  真的
I'm sorry. I am.

98
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,840
我知道你很想
I know you want to.

99
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,760
他可能只是来打探你是否在这里的
He could just be here to see if you were here.

100
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,670
我们不能信任他
We can't trust him.

101
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,220
我曾是他的人
He owned me.

102
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,880
但不再是了
But not anymore.

103
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,720
我过去做的事
What I did,

104
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,560
都是为了某个人
I was doing it for someone else.

105
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,580
她最近跑掉了
She just got away.

106
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,610
所以我来了
So now I'm here.

107
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,080
那你是为了她吗
So are you because of her?

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,800
动手啊
Do it!

109
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,800
你还有另一个选择
There's another choice.

110
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,210
达里尔
Daryl.

111
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,880
-达里尔  你认识她  -尼根信任我
- Daryl, you knew her. - Negan trusts me.

112
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,120
我们可以合作  我们可以阻止他
We can work together, we can stop him.

113
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,910
你认识之前的我  也认识现在的我
You knew me then, and you know me now.

114
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,240
你知道我没有撒谎
You know I'm not lying.

115
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,640
我没有
I'm not.

116
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,090
动手啊
Do it.

117
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,930
动手
Do it!

118
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,880
他们抓住了萨沙  如果她还活着的话
They have Sasha, if she's even alive.

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,550
你为什么不早说
Why didn't you say something?

120
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,270
他可能是我们救回她的唯一机会
He could be our only chance to get her back.

121
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,200
因为我不信任他
Because I don't trust him.

122
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,170
但我信任达里尔
But I trust Daryl.

123
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,420
尼根马上就要来了
Negan's coming soon.

124
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,870
明天
Tomorrow.

125
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,590
大概会来三辆卡车
Three trucks probably.

126
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,580
他和二十名救世军
20 saviors and him.

127
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,730
我可以拖住他们
I can slow them down,

128
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,560
弄些树把路挡住
bring some trees down in the road,

129
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,490
为你们争取一点准备的时间
buy a little time for you guys to get ready.

130
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,710
假如你们能把他们干掉  我们就起了个好头
If you can take them out, that's where we start.

131
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,520
你们杀了他们之后  我会发消息到救世堂
You kill them, I'll radio back to the sanctuary.

132
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,270
救世堂
The sanctuary?

133
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,640
尼根的住处
Where negan lives.

134
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,910
他们是这么叫的
That's what they call it.

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,780
我会发消息给他们  告诉他们一切顺利
I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.

136
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,940
你们把卡车开回去
You drive the trucks back,

137
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,480
我可以领着你们直捣黄龙
and I can lead you right inside,

138
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,060
假如计划得好  我们能把残党都干掉
and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.

139
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,560
再去看看你们的朋友是否还活着
Check to see if your friend's still alive.

140
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,910
然后我们把工人拉拢到我们这边
Then, we get the workers on our side,

141
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,680
增加人数
build our numbers up,

142
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,150
然后一个个哨站杀过去  结束这一切
and go from outpost to outpost and end this.

143
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,390
继续说
Keep talking.

144
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,550
我们刚挑起了大战
We just started it -- the whole thing.

145
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,820
假如他在撒谎  我会慢慢折磨死他
If he's lyin', I'm gonna kill him real slow.

146
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,070
等这一切结束了
When this is done,

147
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,860
我才不管他是不是悔过了
I don't give a damn if he's sorry.

148
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,490
我会杀了那个混蛋的
I will kill that son of a bitch.

149
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,040
假如他在撒谎
If he's lying,

150
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,680
我们早已完了
this is already over.

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
我得走了
Oh, I gotta go.

152
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,420
我得走了
Oh, I gotta go.

153
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,150
事实上  我觉得我们可以...
Fact is, I figured we'd --

154
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,540
我做了一个梦
I had a dream.

155
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,830
你...
You...

156
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,980
你梦到我了吗
You had a dream about me?

157
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,490
你死了
You died.

158
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,740
计划就是这样
That's the plan.

159
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,240
这就是我需要你做的事
That's what I need from you.

160
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,940
你出来的时候  别吱声
And when you come out, not a peep.

161
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,620
他们会投降  假如他们还没投降的话
They will stand down, if they haven't already.

162
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,930
然后  露西尔会杀掉三个人
And then, Lucille here, well, she gets her three,

163
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,930
然后我们带着全新的认知继续前行
and we move forward with a new understanding.

164
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,320
你是在...你是在逗我吗
Are you -- are you shitting me?

165
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,390
那是真的眼泪吗
Is that real?

166
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,090
我可以配合  但没必要杀人
I can do it, but no one has to die.

167
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,510
你错了
You are wrong.

168
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,890
惩罚...
Punishment --

169
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,360
没它什么都做不成
Can't do anything without that.

170
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,770
我们拥有的一切都是建立在惩罚之上的
Punishment is how we built everything we have.

171
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,530
你以为我会坐视你...
You think I'm gonna sit here and let you...

172
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,750
当心点
Careful!

173
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,500
我做什么轮不到你管
You are not letting me do anything.

174
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,820
没必要死人
No one has to die.

175
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,130
好吧
Okay.

176
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,940
这样如何
How about this?

177
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,070
一个
One.

178
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,610
只死一个
Just one.

179
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,130
我本来打算选三个
I mean, I was gonna pull three outta the pool,

180
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,890
但只杀一个
but just one,

181
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,100
专门为了你
and just for you.

182
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,050
好
Okay.

183
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,180
只用死一个人
Just one person has to die.

184
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,820
你真是把我玩弄于股掌之间
You got me wrapped around your little finger.

185
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,060
知道吗
You know that?

186
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,380
这跟男女无关
And it's not a man woman thing.

187
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,560
我是说  就算你有根老二
I mean, if you had a dick,

188
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,320
我还是会有这种感觉的
I would still have these feelings.

189
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,780
45分钟后出发
We roll out in 45.

190
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,520
我们没争取到海边旅馆  但我们有她们的枪
So we don't have Oceanside, but we have their guns.

191
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,560
而尼根手里有萨沙
Negan has Sasha.

192
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,940
达里尔希望我们相信德怀特
Daryl wants us to trust Dwight.

193
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,340
瑞克希望我们留在这以防不测
Rick wants us to stay here in case things go wrong

194
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,230
这样还有另一手牌可打
so there's another card to play,

195
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,950
另一个救世军以为受他们控制的安全之处
another safe place the Saviors think they control.

196
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,180
但他不知道格雷戈里已经离开了
But he doesn't know that Gregory's gone...

197
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,720
也许他告诉了他们一些事
That maybe he's telling them things,

198
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,470
会让他们改变想法
that'll make them think something else.

199
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,730
这些都是会发生的
And it's all about to happen.

200
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,690
你在考虑领导山顶寨反抗
You're thinking of leading the Hilltop over there to fight.

201
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,860
是的
I am.

202
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,020
如果尼根发现他们在计划什么
If Negan finds out they're planning something,

203
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,490
他们就需要帮助了
they're gonna need help,

204
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,980
虽然那些拾荒者都站在他们那边
Even with those scavengers on their side.

205
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,370
你必须现在就决定
Well, you'd have to decide right now,

206
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,100
这是个艰难的决定
and it's a very tough decision.

207
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,420
你笑什么
Why are you smiling?

208
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,940
因为我很高兴你是为我们做决定的人
'cause I'm glad you're the one making it for us.

209
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
该怎么决定
How do I?

210
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,650
我不知道
I don't know.

211
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,350
我只知道你能做出决定
I just know you can.

212
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,980
我来照顾她
Let me take her.

213
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,630
你拿着这个
You take this.

214
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,920
端起枪
Guns up, now.

215
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,310
怎么回事  他已经死了
What the hell? He's dead.

216
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,940
怎么了
What is it?

217
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,300
以前见过这个
We've seen this before.

218
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,690
跟以前一样
Same ones.

219
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,720
伙计  你没事吧
Dude, you okay?

220
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,030
-你要一个人伏击他们吗  -对
- You're gonna ambush them on your own? - Yeah.

221
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,850
现在不可以一个人单干
Going alone doesn't work for this.

222
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,920
我可以
It works for me.

223
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,310
你杀过他们的人了吗
Have you killed any of them?

224
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,770
因为如果你杀过  并且被他们发现了
Because if you have and they've found out,

225
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,860
他们也许会认为是神之国干的
they may think it was the Kingdom,

226
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,880
我们会失去有利条件
and we lose our advantage.

227
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,650
这是行尸的血
It's from walkers.

228
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,840
我们能把路障移开吗
Can we move them aside?

229
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,580
你欲抹杀从前的自己吗
Do you seek to extinguish everything of who you were?

230
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,940
没有  但是
I don't seek it, but...

231
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,980
我不知所从
I'm stuck.

232
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,090
你想让救世军们死吗
You want the Saviors dead?

233
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,890
-摩根  -是的
- Morgan. - Yes, I do.

234
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,480
停止你的愚行
Cease this folly.

235
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,450
加入我的军队
Accompany my regiment.

236
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,270
救世军好似多头巨龙
The Saviors are a dragon with many heads,

237
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,140
兵多将广
their numbers legion.

238
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,680
我们必须联合盟友与之一战
We must seek allies in this endeavor.

239
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
那是本杰明的盔甲
That's Benjamin's armor.

240
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,950
你穿着是为了保护自己  还是为了纪念他
Do you wear it to serve you, or do you wear it in his honor?

241
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,690
摩根
Morgan...

248

加入我们的旅程  结为盟友
Join us on this journey to create an alliance.

249
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,900
和我们一起战斗
Fight with us,

250
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,780
我们会打败他们  不会再让别人
and we shall defeat them so that no one will suffer

251
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,070
被他们玩弄蹂躏
under their capricious malevolence ever again.

252
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,700
我们为了逝者
And we start once more for the fallen...

253
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,840
为了神之国
for the Kingdom...

254
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,190
为了胜利的荣耀再次战斗
...for the glory of victory.

255
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,040
你们为何而战
What you fight for.

256
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,470
不是为了这个地方  而是为了彼此
Not the place -- the people, each other.

257
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,300
现在你们也是我们的一员了
You're a part of that now.

258
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,100
我们只拿  不费心  这是我们的方式
We take. We don't bother --our way.

259
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,890
也许该换种方式了
Maybe another way.

260
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
你男人吗
Yours?

261
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,020
我们是在一起
Yeah, we're together.

262
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,850
我过后要睡他
I lay with him after.

263
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,760
你介意吗
You care?

264
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,600
-该回去干活了  -是啊
- We should get back to work. - Yeah.

265
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,790
你觉得是他们干的吗
Think this was them?

266
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,230
我想过
Crossed my mind.

267
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,210
我们有后备计划
We got a plan "B."

268
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,000
恕我直言
If I might be so bold...

269
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,390
这突然的阻碍让我
this unexpected stoppage has given me

270
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,420
有机会能好好考虑一下
the chance for an exhaustive mull.

271
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,470
根据现在的严峻形势
Now, given the loaded circumstances

272
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,720
还有潜在伤亡和资源消耗
and potential for casualties and resource expenditure,

273
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,870
你能不能给我个机会
I was wondering if you would give me the opportunity

274
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,210
去劝降他们  让他们冷静
to attempt to slow their jets and cool their roll.

275
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,280
你以前用过这种枪吗
You shoot one of these before?

276
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,190
很好
Good.

277
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,690
担心吗
Worry?

278
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,140
不
No.

279
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,800
很好
Good.

280
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,500
-我去另一个塔  -为什么
- I'll be on the next one over. - Why?

281
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,420
分头行动视野更好
It's more sight lines if we split up.

282
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,520
我去
I'll go.

283
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,030
你确定吗
You sure?

284
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,410
好吧
Okay.

285
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,060
我们会赢
We win.

286
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,100
是啊
Yeah.

287
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,180
你知道会发生什么事
You know what's gonna happen,

288
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,350
这会如何结束
How this is gonna end.

289
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,590
你知道会发生什么事
You know what's gonna happen,

290
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,640
这会如何结束
How this is gonna end.

291
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,690
我们要一起走出那扇门
We're gonna walk out that door together.

292
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,420
同甘共苦
We kick shit and eat snakes.

293
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,150
-我们就是这样  -我们这次可以不管
- That's us. - We can sit this one out.

294
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,420
反正他们也需要我们留在这
They need us here, anyway.

295
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,060
瑞克说要准备好战斗
Rick said to get ready for a fight.

296
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,200
我怎么死的
How'd I die?

297
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,150
我们当时在沙滩上
We were at the beach.

298
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,030
是在灾变前
It was before.

299
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,910
你被水卷了进去
You got pulled under...

300
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,430
没能出来
And you didn't come back up.

301
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,050
我试着去找你  但是你不见了
I was trying to find you, but you were gone.

302
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,970
然后  我开始溺水
And then, I started to drown.

303
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,570
我讨厌沙滩
I hate the beach.

304
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,390
穿着橡胶衣玩一天
End of the day in a wet suit?

305
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,700
回到车上的每一步
It's like you're sandblasting your nutsack

306
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,120
蛋都像在被喷砂
every single step you take back to the car.

307
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,350
还好今天不去海边
Luckily, the seaside ain't on the agenda today.

308
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,550
只是守卫和赶路
Just security and some road to chew.

309
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,780
好吗  来吧
All right? So, come on.

310
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,810
-我们去帮玛姬  -亚伯拉罕
- Let's go help Maggie. - Abraham.

311
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,250
什么
What?

312
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,330
这里需要我们
They can use us here.

313
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,890
就这一次  我们不逞英雄
Just once, we sit one out.

314
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,890
-别人...  -应该是我们
- Someone else -- - it should be us.

315
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,890
玛姬应该靠自己
Maggie's gotta take care of maggie.

316
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,900
吃过敏药的事
Have you, uh, changed your mind

317
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,120
你有没有改变主意
about taking that allergy medication?

318
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,230
-有  -很好
- Yes. - Good.

319
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,850
我觉得你会适应这个地方的
I think you'll get adjusted to the place, sinus-wise.

320
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,230
不会的
No, I won't.

321
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,100
不像你
Not like you.

322
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,600
每个人都有自己的出路
Everyone has a way out.

323
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,420
别因为我的选择批判我
Don't go and yuck my yum for takin' mine,

324
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,440
顺便说  你也选的一样
which, I may add, is the same as yours now.

325
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,140
如果今天有人死  都是自己选的
If people die today, it's 'cause of the choices they made.

326
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,590
是啊  确实如此
Yeah. It is.

327
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,140
我们在这里做什么
Why are we here?

328
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,490
等这个
For this.

329
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,360
罗西塔
Rosita.

330
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,520
就位
Get into position.

331
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,510
我给你信号
I'll signal you.

332
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,920
墙没问题吧
And the wall's gonna hold?

333
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,290
没问题
It'll hold.

334
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,700
你们已被包围
All points are covered.

335
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,980
所有意外都在考虑内
Every contingency is already met.

336
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,740
我带着真相前来
I come armed with two barrels of the truth.

337
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,830
大考将至  而我给你们带来了小抄
A test is upon you, and I'm giving out the cheat sheet.

338
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,340
你们好
H-hello.

339
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,680
我前来劝降  因为我知道你们通情达理
I come salved with the hope that it is my dropped knowledge that you heed.

340
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,990
你们没有选择余地
Options are zero to none.

341
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,150
忠诚服从是唯一出路
Compliance and fealty are your only escape.

342
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,040
说白了  你们可生  亦或死
Bottom-lining it -- you may thrive, or you may die.

343
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,020
我衷心希望是前者
I sincerely wish for the former

344
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,930
为了所有人着想
For everyone's sake.

345
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,640
你们已经完全暴露了
The jig is up and in full effect.

346
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,450
你们投降吗  瑞克
Will you comply, rick?

347
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,110
尼根在哪
Where's Negan?

348
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,560
我是尼根
I'm Negan.

349
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,290
不
No.

350
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,300
我们会赢
We win.

351
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,510
你听过叫瑞克的小傻瓜
You ever hear the one about the stupid little prick named rick

352
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,370
以为自己本事大却一无所知
who thought he knew shit but didn't know shit

353
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,350
害自己在乎的人被杀光的故事吗
and got everyone he that gave a shit about killed?

354
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,780
说的就是你
It's about you.

355
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,490
你们最好都把枪放下
You're all gonna wanna put your guns down now.

356
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,400
所有人都别放下枪
No one drops anything.

357
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,890
我们说好的
We had a deal.

358
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,730
塔米尔去拿船上物资
Tamiel came for the boat things.

359
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,730
跟踪了夺走物资的人
Followed ones who took.

360
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,820
做了笔更好的交易
Made a better deal.

361
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:32,410
你一而再  再而三地逼我  瑞克
You push me, and you push me. And you push me, Rick.

362
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,090
你刚才想炸了我们是吧
You just tried to blow us up, right?

363
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,210
你想弄死我和我的人  我懂
I mean, I get me, my people.

364
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,800
但是尤金呢
But Eugene?

365
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,230
他可是你的人
He's one of yours.

366
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,610
他做了那事之后  洗心革面了
And after what he did -- he stepped up.

367
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,490
你们这些人
You people...

368
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,770
真是禽兽
are animals.

369
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,340
上帝给了你们启示
Universe gives you a sign, and you just

370
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,840
你们却回了个中指  捅了他的菊花
shove your finger right up its ass.

371
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,810
德怀特  西蒙  快去
Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.

372
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,340
好吧  你们不喜欢尤金了
So, you don't like Eugene anymore.

373
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,740
但你们肯定喜欢萨沙
You guys gotta like Sasha.

374
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,520
我也喜欢她
I do, too.

375
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,360
为了方便你们  我把她装在这里面了
Got her right here packaged for your convenience,

376
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,710
毫发无损
alive and well.

377
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,440
我带来了她  就不用杀了你们所有人了
Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you,

378
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,360
但不把你们都杀了  事情会变得很复杂
and not killing all of you could get complicated.

379
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,890
我知道里面还有很多武器  瑞克
See, I know there's a lot of firepower left in there, Rick.

380
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,560
我的要求很简单
So I'm gonna make this simple.

381
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,440
我要你们想方设法积攒来的所有枪
I want all the guns you've managed to scrape up.

382
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,970
是的  这个我也知道
Yep, I know about those, too.

383
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,330
我要你们剩下的所有柠檬粉
I want every last grain of lemonade you got left.

384
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,030
我还要你选一个人
I want a person of your own choosing...

385
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,320
送给露西尔
For Lucille.

386
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,960
达里尔
Daryl --

387
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,390
我得要回我的达里尔
Ooh, I gotta get me my Daryl back.

388
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,760
我看到你了
I see you.

389
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,170
还有台球桌
And the pool table

390
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,850
全部台球杆和巧粉
and all the pool cues and chalk.

391
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,620
我现在就要
And I want it now

392
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,550
不然萨沙就得死
or Sasha dies,

393
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,580
然后你们所有人都得死
And then all of you.

394
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,710
大概吧
Probably.

395
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,300
行了  瑞克
C'mon, Rick.

396
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,720
我把她装在棺材里带来
Just because I brought her in a casket

397
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,270
不意味着她就得死在里面
doesn't mean she has to leave in it.

398
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,910
你知道吗
You know what?

399
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,490
你逊毙了  瑞克
You suck ass, Rick.

400
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,990
真的
You really do.

401
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,820
我不想杀她
I don't want to have to kill her,

402
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,330
但这正是你逼我要做的事情
but that's exactly what you're gonna make me do.

403
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,600
让我看看她
Let me see her.

404
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,150
好吧  给我点时间
All right. Just give me a second.

405
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,690
我也许得跟她说说现在什么情况了
I might have to get her up to speed.

406
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,240
在棺材里可什么都听不到
You can't hear shit inside this thing.

407
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,960
萨沙
Sash.

408
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,880
你绝对不会相信这破事的
You're not gonna believe this crap.

409
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,740
感觉很真实
It felt real.

410
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,030
感觉很真实
It felt real.

411
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,570
像是失去了这一切
Like we lost this.

412
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,060
而我们才刚刚开始
And this just started.

413
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,690
-走吧  -等等
- C'mon. - Wait.

414
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,870
我喜欢你看穿我的样子
I like the way you call bullshit.

415
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,640
所以这次让我来帮帮你吧
So let me return the favor.

416
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,070
接下来你要跟我说的是
The next thing you're gonna tell me

417
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,580
你会去  这样我就可以留下
is that you'll go and that I can stay.

418
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,380
因为我知道  你自己也不想说出
Because I know you didn't like hearing yourself just say

419
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,560
"玛姬应该靠自己"这种话
that, "Maggie's gotta take care of Maggie."

420
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,970
我知道这句话会萦绕在你脑中
I know those words are gonna choke in your ears

421
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,160
很久很久
a good, long while

422
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,640
你会因为仅仅有这念头而做出补偿
and you're gonna wanna make up for even thinking that.

423
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,980
我说得对吗
Am I right?

424
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,630
对
Yeah.

425
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:47,160
我们为别人置生死于度外
We lay our big meaties across the chopping block ahead of someone else's.

426
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,000
总是为别人
It's always for someone else.

427
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,160
我们都知道  如果我们要死
Both of us know, if we're gonna kick,

428
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,620
那最好死得有意义
there sure as hell better be a point to it.

429
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,270
所以或许我们觉得这一切都是有意义的
So maybe we feel there was a-a point to all of this.

430
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,380
自始至终
Alpha to omega.

431
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,100
不管是在战场  还是在海边
Whether it's on the battlefield or the beach

432
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,730
还是别的什么地方
or somewhere out there today.

433
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,970
玛姬
Maggie --

434
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,420
她怀着未来
She's carrying the future.

435
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,330
你说得对
You're right.

436
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,710
我就知道会这样
I knew how this was gonna end.

437
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,420
走吧
C'mon.

438
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,060
为别人冒生命危险
Layin' your ass on the line for someone else,

439
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,090
为他们扫除障碍
Tearin' it to shreds for 'em --

440
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,600
你以前说过
You said it before.

441
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,760
这才叫活着
Oh, my, that is living.

442
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,860
你真是个傻瓜
You're an idiot.

443
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,360
我从没说过我不是
I never said otherwise.

444
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,280
去那里要几个小时  对吗
A couple hours to get there, right?

445
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,720
至少吧
At least.

446
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,190
路上也许障碍重重
Might be a circuitous and janky route.

447
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,050
鉴于他们在谋反  道路很可能被监视了
With what they're planning, they could be watching the roads.

448
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,750
"他们在谋反"
"What they're planning."

449
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,120
没错
That's right.

450
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,370
我在市集拿的  存满了歌
Got it in the marketplace. It's chock-full.

451
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,790
在途中恐怕无法交谈
Doubt conversation will be on tap for the commute.

452
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,260
尽管我是个自私的懦夫
And though I am a selfish coward,

453
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,600
我有时也会为别人着想
I do tend to think of other people on occasion.

454
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,400
请收下我的馈赠吧
Please take it with my compliments.

455
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,710
我真心希望我能做好人
I truly wish I measured up.

456
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,190
你依然可以  尤金
You still can, Eugene.

457
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,450
我不会放弃
I'm not giving up.

458
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,790
不会放弃你
Not on you.

459
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,260
天啊  你不用躺在那玩意儿里面过去
Jesus, you don't have to take the trip in the thing.

460
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,940
我想休息一下
I could use the rest.

461
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,310
不是吧
No shit?

462
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,790
是的
Yeah.

463
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,300
我只想睡觉
I just want to go to sleep.

464
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,850
给我一小瓶水就行了
I just need a little bottle of water, and I'm fine.

465
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,280
阿拉特
Arat?

466
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,490
听着
Listen...

467
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
我知道这有多难
I know how tough this is.

468
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,800
我很感激
And I appreciate it.

469
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,360
该死  你真了不得
Damn, you are something else.

470
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:11,180
正在播放
《总有一天  我们都会自由》
唐尼・海瑟威

471
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,460
萨沙
Sash.

472
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,290
你绝对不会相信这破事的
You're not gonna believe this crap.

473
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,410
我的妈呀
Holy goddamn!

474
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,230
快走
Go! Go!

475
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,240
别
No.

476
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,650
亲爱的  该死
Aah! honey, god damn it!

477
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,050
那就后备计划吧
Plan "B" It is!

478
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,190
跪下  快点
Down. Now.

479
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,570
我们可以重新做笔交易
We can make another deal.

480
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,370
我说了跪下
I said, down.

481
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,470
又见面了
Hello again.

482
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,940
跪下  不然再吃一枪
Down. Or again.

483
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,200
靠  瑞克
Well, shit, Rick.

484
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,670
你就不能老实跟着我们吗
You just couldn't stick with us, huh?

485
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,980
非要找这些捡破烂的脏人
You had to go with these filthy garbage people?

486
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,190
无意冒犯
No offense.

487
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,380
说好了是12个  对吗
Deal is for 12, yes?

488
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,720
10个
10.

489
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,850
人才是资源
People are a resource.

490
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,060
12个
12.

491
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:54,760
10个
10.

492
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,710
瑞克
Rick.

493
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,850
这会让你难过的
This is just gonna make you sad.

494
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,110
心碎
Broken.

495
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,210
你会希望你死了
You're gonna wish you were dead.

496
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,550
我喜欢闹着玩
I like having fun.

497
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,530
真的
I do.

498
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,550
但也许你觉得对你朋友做出那种事的人不是我了
But maybe you think that the guy that did what he did to your friends wasn't me,

499
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:30,200
以为那不过是某种作秀
like that was some sort of a put-on,

500
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,210
以为我不是拿着大棒的人
like I'm not the guy with the bat --

501
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,120
只是个给你孩子做意面的人
I'm just the guy that makes your kid spaghetti.

502
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,290
靠
Oh, shit.

503
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,200
也许这怪我
Maybe this is on me.

504
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,910
也许这全都怪我
Maybe this is all on me.

505
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,070
我必须纠正错误
I gotta make it right.

506
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,840
我猜又要重来一遍了
I guess I gotta start all over again.

507
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,180
必须告诉你  瑞克
I gotta tell you, Rick,

508
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,640
假如我有孩子
if I had a kid,

509
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:05,250
我希望他跟你孩子一样
I'd want him to be just like your kid,

510
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,820
所以这就更难了
which makes this so much harder.

511
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,660
你赢不了的
You're not gonna win.

512
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,930
卡尔
Carl.

513
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,480
已经结束了
It is over.

514
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,490
何不用你的独眼
Why don't you point your one ball

515
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,350
看看那边  感受一下
up the street there and take it all in?

516
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,210
我们会赢
We'll win!

517
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,360
我们会活
We live!

518
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,630
是我们
We're the ones!

519
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,180
我们
Us!

520
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:13,750
你刚失去了某个重要的人  就在刚刚
You just lost somebody important to you right now -- like, just now.

521
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,030
老天啊
Jesus.

522
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,540
时机刚好
That is timing.

523
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,410
瑞克
Well, Rick...

524
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,500
这是你选的
you chose this.

525
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:31,300
我真不知道我还能怎么警告你
I truly don't know what more I could've done to warn you.

526
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,390
而且这不是警告了
And this isn't a warning.

527
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,450
这是惩罚
This is punishment.

528
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,120
我现在要杀了卡尔
I'm gonna kill Carl now.

529
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,970
我会狠狠地  重重地挥一棒
I'm gonna make it one nice, hard swing,

530
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:50,630
试着一击毙命  因为我喜欢他
try to do it in one because I like him.

531
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,480
我只想让你把这个念头放进脑子里
I just want you to put that in your brain

532
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,890
细细回味一下
and roll it around for a minute.

533
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,350
我会杀了卡尔  然后露西尔
I'm gonna kill Carl, and then Lucille here,

534
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,420
她会砸烂你的双手
she's gonna take your hands.

535
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,380
你可以就在我面前做
You can do it right in front of me.

536
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,960
你可以砸烂我的双手
You can take my hands.

537
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,830
我已经告诉过你了
I told you already --

538
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,510
我会杀了你
I'm gonna kill you.

539
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,740
你们所有人
All of you.

540
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,220
也许不在今天  也许不在明天
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow...

541
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:30,230
但没有什么能改变这点
but nothing is gonna change that --

542
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,170
没有什么
Nothing.

543
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,780
你们已经死了
You're all already dead.

544
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:54,770
靠
Damn.

545
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
瑞克
Wow, Rick.

546
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:04,950
好吧
Okay.

547
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,990
你说了我可以做
You said I could do it.

548
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,890
灭了救世军和他们的同伙
End these Saviors and their accomplices!

549
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,290
亚历山大不会陷落  不在今天
Alexandria will not fall, not on this day!

550
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,370
方形阵  第三队  上
Phalanx out, third group, now!

551
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,570
上  我们掩护你们
Move up! Now we got your backs!

552
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,740
他妈的一头老虎啊
A goddamn tiger!

553
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,040
那寡妇没死  活蹦乱跳的
That widow is alive, guns a-blazin'!

554
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,650
你尝到了吗  西蒙  这就是吃屎的滋味
You taste that, Simon? That is the taste of shit!

555
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,660
他们撤退了
They're falling back.

556
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,330
爱德华多  伯蒂  去房屋之间
Eduardo, Bertie, between the houses --

557
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,430
掩护大门
Cover the gate!

558
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,840
走
Let's go.

559
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,300
现在收尾
Now we finish this!

560
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,420
上
Now!

561
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,670
拉
Pull! ?

562
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,150
米琼恩
Michonne.

563
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,200
米琼恩
Michonne. ?

564
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,470
你还活着
Oh, you're alive.

565
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,870
我们...
We -- W-We're...

566
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,020
我们...
We're...

567
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,050
我知道  我知道
I know. I know. ?

568
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,760
我知道
I know.

569
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,390
我们活下来了
We are.

570
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,710
我们会活下去
We will.

571
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,300
准备已就绪
Getting preparations in place.

572
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,750
所有人都是蓝色警戒
Everyone's on "Blue level."

573
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,760
只要你下令  他们就出发
You say the word, they're ready to go.

574
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,700
很好
That's good.

575
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,530
你觉得她怎么会死在棺材里
How the hell do you think she wound up dead in that box?

576
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,600
最可能的原因是油布
My, um, best possible posit fingers the tarp.

577
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,310
棺材被封得严严实实
That sealed up said box good and tight.

578
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,410
没氧气了
She ran out of air.

579
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,670
也许吧
Maybe.

580
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,220
那么
So...

581
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,050
我们要开战了
we are going to war!

582
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,780
遵命
Yes, sir!

583
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,940
你觉得萨沙是一个人做到的吗
Do you think Sasha did that herself?

584
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,250
我不知道怎么做到的  但我知道她做到了
I don't know how, but I know she did.

585
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,880
她给了我们机会  你给了我们机会
She gave us a chance. You did.

586
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,320
你选择过来是正确的
You made the right decision to come.

587
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,290
这选择很早以前就做了
The decision was made a long time ago,

588
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,560
在我们大家相识之前
before any of us knew each other,

589
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,040
当我们还是在街上擦肩而过的陌生人时
when we were all strangers who would have just passed each other on the street

590
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,870
在世界结束之前
before the world ended.

591
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,220
现在我们对彼此意味着一切
And now we mean everything to each other.

592
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,410
你遇到了麻烦  你陷入了困境
You were in trouble. You were trapped.

593
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,730
格伦不认识你  但他救了你
Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.

594
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,770
他为你冒了生命危险
He put himself in danger for you.

595
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,340
这是一切的源头
And that started it all --

596
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,280
从亚特兰大  到我爸爸的农场
From Atlanta, to my daddy's farm,

597
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,700
到监狱
to the prison,

598
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,170
到这里
to here...

599
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,040
到此时此刻
to this moment now...

600
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,900
我们不再是陌生人
not as strangers --

601
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,040
而是家人
as family...

602
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:13,810
当时不知道

603
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:25,600
因为格伦那天选择救了你
because Glenn chose to be there for you that day

604
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,280
很久很久以前
a long time ago.

605
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,000
而那个选择改变了一切
That was the decision that changed everything.

606
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,970
这是你们俩发起的
It started with both of you,

607
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,800
然后不断壮大
and it just grew...

608
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,470
如今我们所有人
to all of us...

609
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,440
为彼此做出牺牲
to sacrifice for each other...

610
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,430
承受苦难
to suffer and stand,

611
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,190
去哀悼  去给予
to grieve, to give,

612
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:21,240
去爱  去生活
to love, to live...

613
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,540
去为彼此而战
to fight for each other.

614
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,300
格伦做出了那个选择  瑞克
Glenn made the decision, Rick.

615
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,800
我不过是在追随他的脚步
I was just following his lead.
