00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,660
在终点站
At Terminus?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,730
如果他们的家长保护他们  就会有
If their parents kept them safe.

29
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,290
就像泰尔西保护了你们一样

30

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,400
有人对他开枪

我开枪杀了他们
I shot them.

33

首先是个男人  然后是个女人

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,130
我本来不想打中她的头的
I didn't mean to shoot her in the head.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,030
你必须这样做
You had to.

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,310
你救了泰尔西
You saved Tyreese.

37
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,580
也许那里会有小孩
Maybe there'll be kids there,

38
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,710
就算他们的家长没能保护他们
even if their parents couldn't keep them safe.

39
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,240
也许是小孩保护了家长
Maybe the kids kept their parents safe.

她很可爱
She was sweet.

47
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,630
她天生就心地善良
She didn't have a mean bone in her body.

48
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,900
所以她没活下来吗
Is that why she isn't here now?

49
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,150
是的
Yeah.

50

我没必要想你
I'm not gonna have to miss you.

54
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,470
你累坏了
You're dead on your feet.

55

-很疼  对吗  -是的  很疼

这会消炎
This will fight the infection.

68
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,900

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,090
你怎么看
What do you think?

70

丽兹心狠手辣

74

那是对人类
When it comes to people.

75

你什么意思
What do you mean?

76
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,660
你没看到吗
You haven't seen it?

77
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,880
她把行尸搞混了
How she's confused about them, the walkers.

78
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,310
她没有看出它们的本质
She doesn't see what they are.

79
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,690
觉得它们只是不一样
She thinks they're just different.

80
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,740

《汤姆・索耶历险记》的结局好吗

我们还没有读完呢

85
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,600
汤姆和哈克
Well, Tom and Huck,

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,610
阻止了印江・乔埃和他的同伴
they stop Injun Joe and his partner

87
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,450
然后拿到了他们的金子

88
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,060
-所以说他们最后变富翁了  -是的
- So they wind up rich? - Mm-hmm.

89
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,210
道格拉斯寡妇收养了哈克
And the Widow Douglas adopts Huck.

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,070
就像你收养了我们一样

是的  就像道格拉斯寡妇一样

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,920

我觉得你更像汤姆・索耶
I think you're more like Tom Sawyer.

94
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,880
汤姆比较孩子气  哈克则坚强冷静

95
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,700
是啊  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

96
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,440
你更像哈克・费恩
You're way more like Huck Finn.

97
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,020
死兔子都没有恶心到你
You're not even grossed out by dead rabbits.

98
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,710
我都忘了你以前会给他们读故事了
Forgot you used to read to them.

99
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,060
是啊
I did.

100
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,940
-你闻到了吗  -闻到了
- You smell that? - Yeah.

101
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,890
有地方着火了
There's a fire somewhere.

102
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,450
肯定是场大火  这附近没有着火
Must be a big one. It isn't anywhere around here.

103
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,580
我们应该停下来  找点水
We should stop here. We need to look for water.

104
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,060
我去找
I can do it.

105
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,940
不  你需要休息  让胳膊休息一下
No, you need rest. Rest your arm.

106
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,390
米卡会帮我的
Mica will help me.

107
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,540
我看到了树跟草
I spy trees and weeds.

108
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,850
该你了
Your turn.

109
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,480
给你  待着别动
Here. You stay here.

110
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,330
泰尔西
Tyreese.

111
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,910
有时我们必须杀了他们
Sometimes we have to kill them.

112
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,400
我知道  但有时我们不必
I know that. But sometimes we don't.

113
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,160
你知道丽兹比我力气大的
You know Lizzie can carry a lot more than me.

114
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,540
我让你来是因为我有话对你说
I had you come because I wanted to talk to you.

115
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,060
为什么
Why?

116
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,030
因为你很小  而且很善良
Because you're little and you're sweet

117
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,350
这会让你丧命
and those are two things that can get you killed.

118
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,890
你不能马上长大
You can't change how big you are...

119
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,460
我希望我能
I wish I could.

120
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
但是你可以坚强起来
...but you can toughen up.

121
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,800
我不必变坚强
I don't have to be tough.

122
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,580
我可以跑  我跑得很快
I can run. I'm good at that.

123
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,890
不行
No.

124
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,310
我女儿也会跑  但是这不够
My daughter ran and it wasn't enough.

125
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,350
所以在监狱里我教孩子们别的技能
That's why I taught the kids at the prison to do more than that.

126
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,260
我可以杀行尸
I can kill walkers.

127
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,580
我是说  我试过
I mean, I've tried.

128
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,010
我跟我姐姐不一样  我心理很正常
I'm not like my sister. I'm not messed up.

129
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,140
我知道行尸是什么
I know what they are.

130
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,690
但是我不能杀人
But I can't kill people.

131
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,950
我下不了手
I could never do that.

132
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,380
那些坏人来到监狱的时候
When the bad people were at the prison,

133
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,950
他们就在我们面前
they were right in front of us

134
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,270
我举起枪
and I held up my gun,

135
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,320
但是我没能按下扳机
but I couldn't pull the trigger.

136
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,170
杀人是不对的
Killing people is wrong.

137
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,340
有人杀了凯伦和大卫
Someone killed Karen and David.

138
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,150
就那样把他们杀了  他们人很好
They just killed them. They were nice.

139
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,060
那有人要杀你怎么办
What about people who try to kill you?

140
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,870
那我也不希望杀人
I don't even wish I could.

141
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,050
那些人闯进来杀了我们的朋友
People came in and killed our friends.

142
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,960
我同情那些人
And I feel sorry for them.

143
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,840
为什么
Why?

144
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,220
因为他们以前八成不是这样的
Because they probably weren't like that before.

145
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,650
你迟早得这么做的
Sooner or later you're gonna have to do it.

146
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,860
你必须这么做  不然你就会死
You'll have to do it or you'll die.

147
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,440
所以你得改变你的想法
So you're gonna change the way you think about it.

148
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,620
你必须改变  每个人都变了
You have to change. Everyone does now.

149
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,110
事情不会自己变好的
Things don't just work out.

150
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,970
看
Look.

151
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,420
我妈曾说过
My mom used to say

152
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,260
一切自有天意
everything works out the way it's supposed to.

153
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,240
这些是什么
What are these?

154
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,100
-山核桃  -我超喜欢山核桃
- Pecans. - Oh, I love pecans.

155
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,550
也许我们能在这儿喘口气
You know, maybe we could catch our breath here for a while.

156
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,380
我们还是要去终点站的  是吧
We're still going to Terminus, right?

157
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,020
我们只在这儿待个一两天
We'll just stay a day or two.

158
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,930
这儿有满满一井水
There's a well full of water.

159
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,640
有围栏  虽然不是很高  但也能挡一下
Fences. They're not big, but they're something.

160
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,320
而且我们之前看到鹿了  它们吃山核桃
And we saw deer. They eat pecans.

161
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,800
我们应该能打到一只来吃
We should be able to kill one to eat.

162
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,440
我们也能吃山核桃吧  对吗
We can eat these, too, right?

163
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,240
你可以吃个饱
You can eat your fill and then some.

164
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,010
看
Look.

165
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,150
那肯定就是我们刚刚闻到的东西
Bet that's what we were smelling.

166
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,250
看起来够远的
Looks far enough away.

167
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,180
我想知道是怎么烧起来的
I wonder how it started.

168
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,290
也许是闪电  也许是营火
Maybe lightning. Maybe a campfire.

169
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,900
我可以去把围栏补一补
I can patch that fence.

170
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,580
那里八成是鹿进出的地方
It's probably where the deer are coming from.

171
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,010
我们应该把开口留着  给自己留条后路
We should leave it. Just play it really safe in here.

172
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,740
假如里面有个行尸  它还真没怎么动啊
If there's one in there, it's not moving much.

173
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,890
我们挨得近一点
Let's just stay close,

174
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,540
一间间慢慢检查
go slow room to room.

175
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,800
姑娘们  你们好好待着
Girls, you sit tight.

176
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,640
在我们出来前你们别进来
You don't come in until we come out

177
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,140
无论你们听到了什么
no matter what you hear.

178
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,180
-好的  -好的
- Okay. - Okay.

179
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,810
丽兹抱着朱迪思呢  米卡把你的枪拿出来
Lizzie's got Judith. Mica, get out your gun.

180
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,860
你得站岗
You're gonna need to stand watch.

181
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,590
坚强点  小姑娘
Stand strong, little lady.

182
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,470
他们不会有事的
They're gonna be okay.

183
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,220
我不是在想那个
It's not that.

184
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,350
是因为那里埋了个婴儿吗
Is it that there was a baby?

185
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,160
不是
No.

186
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,240
他们会在里面发现一个行尸  然后...
They're gonna find one in there and they're going--

187
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,200
别说了  它们已经不是人了
Stop it. They aren't people.

188
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,340
但是你错了  所有人都错了
But you're wrong. All of you.

189
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,100
它们不是人  丽兹  它们是死人
They aren't people, Lizzie. They're just dead.

190
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,040
住手  住手  住手
Stop! Stop! Stop!

191
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,490
你没事吧
Are you okay?

192
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,550
没事了  来吧  起来吧
All right, come on. Come on.

193
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,150
来吧  来吧  我抱住你了  小姑娘
Come on, come on. I got you, little girl.

194
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,830
-好了  来吧  -米卡
- Come on. Come here. - Mica.

195
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,310
米卡  把枪放下
Mica, lower the gun.

196
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,950
你做到了  你救了她们
You did it. You saved them.

197
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,850
你为什么这么难过  丽兹  你被吓到了吗
Why are you upset, Lizzie? Were you scared?

198
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,120
不是
No.

199
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,610
那你为什么哭
Then why are you crying?

200
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,600
我不想说
I don't want to say.

201
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,610
丽兹
Lizzie.

202
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,530
对不起我吼你了
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

203
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,710
你看看这些花儿就好了
Just look at the flowers like you're supposed to.

204
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,490
数一二三
Count one, two, three.

205
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,000
来吧  我们一起数
Come on, let's count together.

206
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,810
瞧瞧那朵粉色的  你看到了吗
Look at the pink ones over there. You see?

207
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,300
一二三
One, two, three.

208
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,170
你还是很心烦吗
You still upset?

209
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,760
有时我真的不理解
Sometimes I don't understand,

210
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,930
但我在努力去理解  女士
but I'm trying to, ma'am.

211
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,750
真的
I am.

212
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,200
看我找到了什么
Look what I found.

213
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,190
我打算给她起名为格丽泽尔达・冈德森
I'm gonna name her Griselda Gunderson.

214
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,830
我们有很多水
Well, we got plenty of water.

215
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,620
现在只要再杀一头鹿就万事齐全了
Now all we got to do is bag one of them deer and we're all set.

216
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,900
-那就去弄一头  -好
- Then we'll get one. - Yeah.

217
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,050
-怎么了  -我不太习惯这样
- What's wrong? - I'm not used to this.

218
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,110
习惯什么
Used to what?

219
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,330
我们居然在一所房子的客厅里
We're in a living room in a house.

220
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,750
对  所以放松点
Yeah, so relax.

221
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,400
我们应该住在这儿
We should live here.

222
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,490
格丽泽尔达
Griselda.

223
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,000
丽兹
Lizzie.

224
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,660
快点
Come on.

225
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,670
-快离开它  -不不不
- You get away from it! - No, no, no!

226
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,930
-马上  丽兹  -不不不
- Right now, Lizzie. - No, no, no, no, no.

227
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,900
-不  不  -丽兹  丽兹
- No, no, no, no. - Lizzie! Lizzie!

228
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,490
不  不
No! No!

229
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,570
她在跟我玩  她只是想要个朋友
She was playing with me. She wanted a friend.

230
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,750
它是想杀了你
She wanted to kill you.

231
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,710
-我打算引她离开  -你差点就死了
- I was gonna lead her away. - You could have died.

232
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,800
一回事  你杀了她
It's the same thing! You killed her!

233
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,390
-你杀了她  就是一回事  -丽兹
- You killed her! It's the same thing! - Lizzie.

234
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,810
-如果我杀了你怎么样  -丽兹
- What if I killed you?! What if I killed you?! - Lizzie.

235
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,560
-你不明白  你不明白  -丽兹
- You don't understand. You don't understand. - Lizzie.

236
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,830
你不明白  你不懂你不懂
You don't understand. You don't understand. You don't understand!

237
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,450
丽兹  丽兹
Lizzie. Lizzie.

238
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,380
你不一定要杀她啊
You didn't have to.

239
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,740
没必要啊  她没想伤害谁
You didn't have to. She didn't want to hurt any...

240
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,140
她没想伤害任何人
She didn't want to hurt anybody!

241
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,960
她是我朋友  你却杀了她
She was my friend and you killed her!

242
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,690
你杀了她
You killed her!

243
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,110
你杀了她
You killed her!

244
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,130
她是我朋友
She was my friend.

245
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,680
会不会太重了
Is it too heavy?

246
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,000
不会  没事
Nah, I'm good.

247
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,550
火还在烧
The fire's still burning.

248
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,060
也可能熄灭了
It could have gone out.

249
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,400
不  烟还是黑的
Nope. The smoke's black.

250
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,110
如果烟是白的  火就熄灭了
If it was white, the fire wouldn't be burning anymore.

251
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,710
我好怀念科学课啊
I miss science class.

252
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,360
除了有时候我们得
Except for when we had to do stuff like

253
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,280
把涡虫切碎什么的
cut up planaria worms.

254
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,110
你现在得做更残忍的事情  米卡
You've got to do worse than that nowadays, Mica.

255
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,120
-不一定吧  -一定的
- I don't gotta. - You do.

256
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,390
丽兹比你大  她在某种程度上比你强壮
Lizzie's bigger than you and in some ways she's stronger.

257
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,440
但你更聪明
But you're smarter

258
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,860
而且你也明白这些...道理
and you understand these... things.

259
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,420
你得照顾她
You've got to look out for her.

260
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,810
你必须...
You have to--

261
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,970
不  来吧  你来
No, go ahead. You do it.

262
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,020
就像我在监狱里教你的一样  开始吧
Just like I showed you at the prison. Go ahead.

263
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,300
我不行
I can't.

264
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,870
我们还有核桃啊
We have peaches.

265
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,030
也许我们不必去终点站
Maybe we don't need to go to Terminus.

266
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,940
我想过了
I've been thinking.

267
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,390
米卡说得对
Mica's right.

268
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,070
我们可以留下
We can stay here.

269
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,130
在这里生活
We can live here.

270
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,570
我了解丽兹和米卡
I know Lizzie and Mica.

271
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,620
我了解朱迪斯
I know Judith.

272
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,190
我了解你
I know you.

273
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,480
也信任你
I trust you.

274
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,750
除你们之外  我不知道还能信任谁
And I don't know if I can get that anywhere else.

275
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,180
我们可以留下
We could stay.

276
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,960
在这里生活
We can live here.

277
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,790
丽兹
Lizzie?

278
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,420
丽兹
Lizzie?

279
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,970
别担心
Don't worry.

280
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,030
我还会来喂你的
I'll get you more.

281
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,300
丽兹
Lizzie.

282
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,280
我们给它们取名字时
When we were giving them names,

283
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,080
只是在假装这一切很好玩
we were just pretending things weren't bad.

284
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,530
其实一点不好玩
Things are bad.

285
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,270
这些行尸  它们很坏
Those things, they're bad. They are.

286
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,780
别再自欺欺人了
We can't pretend anymore.

287
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,710
我没有骗自己  是你在骗自己
I'm not pretending. You were.

288
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,630
我知道  我听得见他们的心声
I know. I can hear them.

289
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,280
它们想杀了你
They want to kill you.

290
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,060
他们只不过是想改变我
They just want me to change.

291
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,490
让我变得跟他们一样
They can make me be like them.

292
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,040
或许我应该改变
Maybe I should change.

293
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,480
住手
Stop it.

294
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,020
这样你们就明白了
I can make you all understand.

295
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,990
丽兹
Lizzie.

296
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,860
丽兹  它们来了  丽兹
Lizzie, they're coming. Lizzie!

297
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,330
卡萝尔
Carol!

298
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,670
救命
Help!

299
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,500
救我  卡萝儿  丽兹
Help, Carol! Lizzie!

300
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,500
-丽兹  -米卡
- Lizzie! - Mica!

301
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,780
-米卡  -丽兹
- Mica! - Lizzie!

302
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,410
放开我  救命
Let me go! Help me!

303
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,070
-救命  -躲到我们身后
- Help! - Get behind us!

304
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,980
没事了
It's okay.

305
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,660
你做到了
You did it.

306
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
我得帮忙阻止它们
I had to help stop them.

307
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,800
你现在知道它们是什么了吗
Do you understand what they are now?

308
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,780
我知道...
I know--

309
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,310
我知道我必须做什么了
I know what I have to do now.

310
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,550
我知道了
I know.

311
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,090
现实很丑恶  很可怕
It's ugly and it's scary

312
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,860
也的确会改变你
and it does change you.

313
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,210
一路走来  我们都变了很多 
That's how we get to be here.

314
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,090
这就是成长的代价
That's the cost. That's growing up now.

315
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,830
我不想伤害任何人
I don't want to hurt anyone.

316
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,230
我不想当坏人
I don't want to be mean.

317
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,350
有时候你必须狠心
You have to be sometimes.

318
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,690
不过也只是有时候
But just sometimes.

319
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,250
不  不
No. No.

320
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,650
这里有很多山核桃
Now we have a lot of pecans here.

321
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,240
一大堆
A ton.

322
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,620
-吃烦了吗  -没
- You getting sick of them yet? - Nope.

323
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,980
我小时候  常和祖母一起做这个
I used to make these with my grandma when I was little.

324
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,460
闻起来真香
They smell good.

325
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,670
就这样  好了
There you go. All right.

326
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,620
我想你们可以
I think you guys are ready

327
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,470
开始做点饭了
to start doing the cooking around here.

328
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,390
谁想把它们放进去
Who wants to put 'em in?

329
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,980
我来
Me.

330
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,120
姑娘们喜欢这里
The girls like it here.

331
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,700
我们可以修缮一下  种些吃的
We could build it up, plant more food.

332
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,880
还可以找辆车  以备逃生
We could find a car for an escape route just in case.

333
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,430
如果你不想去终点站  我们可以留在这
If you don't want to go to Terminus, we could stay.

334
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,490
是的
We could.

335
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,800
也不是说我们永远都不去那了
It doesn't mean we can't go someday.

336
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,920
只不过
It's just...

337
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,870
当我们离终点站越来越近  我意识到
when we were getting closer and closer, i realized

338
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,100
我还没有做好和其他人一起生活的准备
I'm just not ready to be around other people yet.

339
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,180
你不用的
You don't have to.

340
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,970
我梦到了凯伦
I dream about Karen.

341
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,320
我每天晚上都会梦到她
I see her every night.

342
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,790
每次我都会忘记她已经死了
And every time I forget she's dead.

343
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,010
有时
Sometimes...

344
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,880
我们会说说话
we just talk.

345
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,390
有时
And sometimes

346
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,590
我看见她在人群中
I see her in the crowd...

347
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,180
在一个我从没去过的城市里
in a city I've never been to.

348
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,840
是在一切都还没有发生的时候
And it's back before everything happened.

349
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,200
而有的时候
And then...

350
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,840
有些晚上  我会做恶梦
some nights, the bad ones...

351
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,410
梦到有人杀了她
I see someone kill her.

352
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,410
某个陌生人
Some stranger.

353
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,840
然后我就又一次失去了她
Then I lose her all over again.

354
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,310
但就是这样  对吗
But that's the deal, right?

355
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,130
活下来的人被死去的人所纠缠
The people who are living are haunted by the dead.

356
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,720
我们就是这样的人
We are who we are.

357
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,300
我们做我们该做的事
And we do what we do

358
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,800
因为他们还在这里
'cause they're still here.

359
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,830
在我们的脑海中
In our heads.

360
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,810
在树林里
In the forest.

361
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,330
整个世界都是他们的影子
The whole world is haunted now.

362
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,660
我们无处可逃
And there's no getting out of that.

363
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,240
到死为止
Not until we're dead.

364
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,590
泰尔西
Tyreese.

365
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,690
也许他们不是在纠缠我们
Maybe they're not haunting us.

366
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,520
也许他们只是在教导我们
Maybe they're just teaching us.

367
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,620
提醒着我们
Helping remind us so--

368
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,200
这样我们才能接受必须做的事
so that we can live with what we have to do.

369
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,450
永远不要为自己感到羞耻  卡萝尔
Don't you ever be ashamed of who you are, Carol.

370
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,410
你为这些姑娘做了正确的事情
You did right by those girls.

371
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,820
你为大家做了正确的事情
You did right by everyone.

372
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,430
我们会抓到一只的
We'll get one yet.

373
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,520
也许还没到打鹿的季节
Probably not even deer season.

374
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,370
我丈夫以前经常打猎
My husband used to hunt.

375
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,030
每年都会讲同一个蠢笑话
He'd tell the same stupid joke every year.

376
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,140
说来听听
You gonna tell it?

377
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,030
话不能说半句  是吧
Well, I guess I have to now, right?

378
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,960
说吧
You do.

379
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,820
好吧
Okay.

380
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,980
坚果罐头和鹿睾丸有什么区别
What's the difference between beer nuts and deer nuts?

381
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,470
坚果罐头大约1.79美元
Beer nuts are around 1.79,

382
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,160
而鹿的睾丸不到1美元
deer nuts are just under a buck.

383
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,160
双关  鹿的睾丸在雄鹿[buck]身下

384
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,460
真的是好蠢
That's good stupid,

385
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,500
但绝对不是个好笑话
but in no way is it stupid good.

386
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,780
我说了嘛  还有好多这种笑话呢
Yeah, I told you. There's more where that came from.

387
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,310
别担心  她会醒过来的
Don't worry. She'll come back.

388
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,110
我没有伤到她的脑子
I didn't hurt her brain.

389
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,240
不  我们得等等
No, no, no! We have to wait.

390
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,620
我要展示给你看  你会明白
I need to show you. You'll see.

391
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,500
你会明白的  我们得等着
You'll finally get it. We have to wait.

392
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,500
丽兹  放下枪
Lizzie, put the gun down.

393
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,320
我只想让大家等一等
I just want us to wait.

394
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,550
我们能等
We can wait.

395
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,140
我们能等  你把枪给我
We can wait. You just give me the gun.

396
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,920
我们能等  我保证
We can wait, I swear.

397
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,330
你和泰尔西应该把朱迪斯带进屋
You and Tyreese should take Judith back.

398
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,220
这里对她不安全
It's not safe for her.

399
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,090
但朱迪斯也会变的
But Judith can change, too.

400
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,190
-我正打算...  -她还不会走路呢
- I was just about to-- - She can't even walk yet.

401
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,030
是的  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

402
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,740
你们俩把朱迪斯带回屋子
So you two take Judith back to the house

403
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,210
然后我们吃午饭
and we'll have lunch.

404
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,150
我会绑住米卡
And I'll just tie Mica up.

405
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,260
确保她不会乱跑
You know, just so she won't go anywhere.

406
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,310
你保证你会那样做吗
Promise that's what you'll do?

407
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,480
我保证
I promise.

408
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,100
我会用她的鞋带绑
I'll use her shoelaces.

409
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,780
咱们走  丽兹
Let's-- let's go, Lizzie.

410
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,000
我给她带了些食物
I brought her some food.

411
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,880
检查了她的房间
Cleared out her room.

412
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,980
确保她没有刀
Made sure she doesn't have any knives,

413
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,680
或任何武器
anything like that.

414
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,990
她有一个装满老鼠的鞋盒
She has a shoe box full of mice.

415
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,500
我问她  是不是她在监狱给行尸喂食
I asked her if she was the one feeding the walkers at the prison.

416
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,420
就是她
That was her.

417
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,830
还有在墓地
And at the tombs,

418
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,020
我们找到的那只兔子
we found this rabbit

419
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,920
被扯得四分五裂  钉在木板上
pulled apart and nailed to a board.

420
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,250
也是她干的
That was her, too.

421
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,150
她说只是为了取乐
Said she was just having fun.

422
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,020
我想着
I was thinking,

423
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,050
也许是她杀死了凯伦和大卫
maybe she killed Karen and David.

424
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,300
但我不知道她怎么能把他们拖走
But I don't know how she could drag them away.

425
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,440
她会让他们变行尸的
She would have let them turn.

426
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,590
不是她杀的
It wasn't her.

427
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,450
我们能做什么
So what do we do?

428
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,190
我可以跟她离开
I could leave with her.

429
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,760
什么
What?

430
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,370
我们不能跟她和朱迪斯睡在同一屋檐下
We can't sleep with her and Judith under the same roof.

431
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,060
你撑不下去的  靠自己不行
You wouldn't make it. Not on your own.

432
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,930
她不能跟着其他人
She can't be around other people.

433
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,260
也许我们可以试着帮她
Maybe we could try to help her.

434
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,260
让她想明白
Talk her back somehow.

435
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,800
她就是这样的孩子
This is how she is.

436
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,860
已经定型了
It was already there.

437
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,020
我没料到
I didn't see it.

438
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,880
-你怎么可能料到  -我该料到的
- How could you? - I should have seen it.

439
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,800
还是我们走吧
So maybe we go.

440
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,000
我和朱迪斯
Me and Judith.

441
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,160
你也撑不下去的
You won't make it either.

442
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,520
不能让她跟着其他人
She can't be around other people.

443
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,720
你应该摘些野花
You should pick some wildflowers for Mica

444
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,070
等米卡醒来后送给她
to give her when she comes back.

445
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,000
好  她会喜欢的
Yeah, she'd love that.

446
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,620
火还在烧
The fire's still burning.

447
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,440
不
No.

448
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,270
烟是白的
The smoke's white.

449
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,300
已经灭了
It's out.

450
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,010
你什么都知道  女士
You know everything, ma'am.

451
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,490
不  我不知道
No, I don't.

452
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,400
怎么了
What is it?

453
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,100
怎么了
What is it?

454
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,020
你生我的气吗
Are you mad at me?

455
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,820
你是想跟我说这个吗
Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?

456
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,990
很抱歉我用枪指着你
I'm sorry I pointed my gun at you.

457
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,710
我只想让你等等
I just needed you to wait.

458
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,810
我知道
I know.

459
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,300
对不起
I'm sorry.

460
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,860
你生我气了
You're mad at me.

461
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,070
我爱你  丽兹
I love you, Lizzie.

462
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,050
一切自有天意
And everything works out the way it's supposed to.

463
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,010
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

464
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,300
求求你别生我的气  我错了
Please don't be mad at me. I'm sorry.

465
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,740
看着花吧  丽兹
You just-- just look at the flowers, Lizzie.

看着花
Just look at the flowers.

看着花就好
Just-- just look at the flowers.

468
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,820
丽兹的父亲死时  卡萝尔对她说过同样的话

469
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,830
我杀了凯伦和大卫
I killed Karen and David.

470
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,390
我必须阻止疫病扩散
I had to stop the illness from breaking out.

471
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,880
我必须救其他人
I had to stop other people from dying.

472

不是丽兹
It wasn't Lizzie.

474

泰尔西  是我干的
Tyreese, it was me.

你要动手就动手吧
You do what you have to do.

她害怕吗
Was she scared?
