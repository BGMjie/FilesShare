1
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,150
-女士  -丽兹
- Ma'am? - Hi, Lizzy.

2
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,000
他们叫我下来
They told me to come down here.

3
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,040
你还好吗
Are you okay?

4
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,020
很好
Good.

5
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,620
我想见你  因为我要和瑞克出去了
I wanted to see you because I'm going on a run with Rick.

6
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,280
你觉得达里尔死了吗
Do you think Daryl's dead?

7
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,980
不
No.

8
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,130
他得去很远的地方取药
He had to go far away to get the medicine,

9
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,000
所以需要些时间
so it's gonna take a while.

10
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,510
我们失去了D区所有的食物
We lost all our food in cell block D,

11
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,000
所以我们要去找些食物
so we're gonna go look for more

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,750
和别的有用的东西
and whatever else we can find.

13
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,700
现在还没人死
Nobody's died yet.

14
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,810
还没
Yet?

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,480
我觉得很多人都会死
I think a lot of people are going to die.

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,040
总是这样
It's what always happens.

17
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,670
让我很难过  但是
Makes me sad, but...

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,270
至少他们能复生
at least they get to come back.

19
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,620
丽兹  他们复生时  他们不是...
Lizzy, when they come back, they aren't--

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,400
原来的自己
people aren't who they were.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,760
是啊  但他们还存在
Yeah, but they're something.

22
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,530
还活着
They're someone.

23
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,490
我现在很小
I'm little now.

24
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,480
如果我不死  就会长大
If I don't die, I'll get big.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,840
我还是我  但我也会不一样
I'll be me, but I'll be different.

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,470
就是这样
It's how it is.

27
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,890
我们都会改变
We all change.

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,830
我们都不会和原来一样
We all don't get to stay the same way we started.

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,980
丽兹  这更为复杂
Lizzy, it's more complicated--

30
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,440
你说我很软弱  我不是
You said I was weak. I'm not.

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,910
我很坚强  所以我告诉你我的想法
I'm strong, so I'm telling you what I think.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,090
你记得遇到危险时  我教你怎么做吗
You remember what I told you to do when there's danger?

33
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,510
撒丫子就跑
Run as fast as I can.

34
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,400
跑到安全的地方
You run and run until you're safe.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,570
如果你或你妹妹命悬一线
And if it's your life or your sister's life,

36
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,830
你不能害怕杀人
you can't be afraid to kill.

37
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,530
知道吗
Understand?

38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,430
知道
Yes.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,810
你很坚强  丽兹
You are strong, Lizzy.

40
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,140
你会活下来的
You're gonna live.

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,590
你  你妹妹和我
You, your sister, and me--

42
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,290
我们都会活下去  我知道
we're gonna survive, I know it.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
你的匕首呢
Where's your knife?

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
把T恤塞到匕首后面
Put your T-shirt behind it.

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,320
你必须能快速拔刀
You've gotta be able to get to it quickly.

46
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,070
好  妈妈  我是说女士
Yes, Mom. I mean ma'am.

47
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,290
别叫我"妈妈"
Don't call me "Mom."

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,680
那是口误
It was an accident.

49
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,930
别这样叫
Just don't.

50
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,500
好的
Okay.

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,470
怎么了
What is it?

52
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,470
我不怕杀行尸
I'm not afraid to kill.

53
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,690
我只是内心很害怕
I'm just afraid.

54
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,700
你不能害怕
You can't be.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,640
如何做到呢
How?

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,610
去攻克它
You fight it.

57
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,210
战胜它
And fight it.

58
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,390
别放弃
You don't give up.

59
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,690
然后某天
And then one day,

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,840
你就变了
you just change.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,370

We all change.

这条是特纳溪
This is Turner Creek,

83
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,250
顺着下游走几英里就到巴恩斯维尔镇了
so Barnesville must be a few miles downstream.

84
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,690
运气好还可以搞辆车
Sounds like our best chance at finding a new ride.

85
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,810
嘿  泰
Yo, Ty.

Ty!

89
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,500
再往南走几英里就有小镇了
There should be a town a few miles south.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,990
我们浪费了一整晚
Lost a whole night.

91
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,990
我妹妹和其他人...
My sister, everybody else--

92
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,540
可能都死了
they're probably dead.

93
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,110
继续走总有希望
Well, it helps to keep moving.

94
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,830
不  没有
No, it doesn't.

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,370
玛姬本来想跟来的
Maggie wanted to come, you know.

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,190
总得有人留守  照顾大家
Someone had to stay back, watch over things.

97
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,780
你是指让你信任的人留下
Someone you trust, you mean.

98
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,020
他们本来也会被自己的血液呛死
They would have drowned in their own blood.

99
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,720
他们备受煎熬  我解脱了他们
They were suffering. I made it quick.

100
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,950
我们得处理掉尸体
We needed the bodies gone.

101
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,840
以防止病毒扩散
We needed to stop it from spreading.

102
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
他们是当时唯一被感染的人
They were the only ones who were sick.

103
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,350
活着就是隐患
They were a threat.

104
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,200
我这么做是为了救大家
I was trying to save lives.

105
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,320
我迫不得已  总有人得站出来
I had to try. Somebody had to.

106
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,770
也许吧
Maybe.

107
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,740
是碧石吗  
Is that jasper?

108
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,410
成色不错  很衬你的眼睛
It's a good color. Brings out your eyes.

109
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,250
理查德小姐在A区  我们走的时候
When Miss Richards went into A block, we were leaving.

110
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,020
她让我帮她留意
Asked me to keep a lookout.

111
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,670
我打算用这个给她爸爸做墓牌
I'm gonna use it for her old man's marker.

112
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,030
监狱的人你都认识吗
You know all them back there?

113
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,530
在那里一待就是几个小时
You stay in one place more than a couple hours,

114
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,910
能记住的东西连自己也佩服
you'd be surprised what you pick up.

115
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:22,640
抱歉  车很脏

116
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,050
你觉得他们会回来吗
Think they're coming back?

117
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,930
挡风玻璃很干净  被擦过
Windshield's clean, wiped down.

118
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,140
停在这里不会超过一天  可能两天
Can't have been here more than a day, maybe two.

119
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,370
你是说达里尔和其他人
You mean Daryl and the others.

120
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,640
我们此行是以防万一  是吗
That's what this is, right?

121
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,670
以防他们回不来
In case they don't?

122
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,880
在他们回来前  我们先这样
Until they do. That's what this is.

123
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,950
搜索药柜  急救箱
Medicine cabinets, first aid kits--

124
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,780
任何能够帮到赫谢尔的东西
anything that could help Hershel.

125
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,300
我们速战速决
We get in, we get out.

126
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,620
能吃的东西都带走
And if we can eat it, we take it.

127
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,590
无铅柴油

128
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,590
4

129
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,590
.

130
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,590
3

131
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,590
7

132
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,590
7

133
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,590
→HELL[地狱]

134
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,960
你看见什么了吗
You see something?

135
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,240
不清楚  可能吧
I don't know. Maybe.

136
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,310
我们得找一块新电池
We gotta find us a new battery.

137
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,910
里面有些朋友
Got some friends inside.

138
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,540
走吧
Come on.

139
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,220
我们清出一条路  看看有多少行尸
Let's clear a path, see how many we got.

140
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,700
伙计  放轻松
Hey, man, go easy.

141
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,480
我们不清楚里面的情况
We don't know what we're dealing with.

142
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,030
泰尔西
Tyreese!

143
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,570
泰
Ty!

144
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
泰  放开它
Ty, let him go.

145
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,060
你为什么不放开它
Why the hell didn't you let go?

146
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,330
卡萝尔
Carol!

147
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,450
没事的
Whoa, whoa. It's cool.

148
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,610
我们是活人
We're-- we're cool.

149
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,230
我们有水果
We have fruit.

150
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,640
我们有杏  桃子
Yeah, we got apricots, peaches.

151
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,240
给  接着
Here, catch.

152
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
或者  别接
Or, you know, don't.

153
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,960
-怎么弄的  -转角处有个温室
- How'd this happen? - Greenhouse around the corner.

154
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,220
我们想找个地方住一晚
We were looking for a place to crash.

155
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,170
温室房顶坏了
The roof's broken now and

156
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,330
一直被雨水滋润  所以全是水果
it's been getting rain, so it's full of fruit.

157
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,810
我们在那里待了一天
We were there about a day

158
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,310
然后嗜皮者出现了
and the skin-eaters showed up.

159
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,570
很扫兴  兄弟
Killjoys, man.

160
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,510
它们毁了这个世界
Jackin' it up for the whole world.

161
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,610
以前我还觉得所有人都是混蛋
I thought everybody was an asshole before this all went down.

162
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,570
但现在我喜欢人了
Now I love people.

163
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,470
活着的人
You know-- people who are alive.

164
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,540
怎么受伤的
How did it happen?

165
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,900
它们从门口进来
When they were coming in through the door,

166
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,200
我往外爬的时候绊倒了
I tripped crawling out the other side.

167
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,660
把玻璃拔出来了  但是我的肩膀
Pulled the glass out, but my shoulder--

168
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,420
还是疼得要死
it still hurts like a bitch.

169
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,040
脱臼了
It's dislocated.

170
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,820
你能弄好吗
Can you fix it?

171
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,780
过来  躺下
Here, lay on your back.

172
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,480
好了  往边上挪一挪
Okay, scooch over to the edge.

173
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,350
抬起手臂
Just hold your arm...

174
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,260
抓住这个袋子
Grab ahold of this bag.

175
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,830
抓住了
Hold on.

176
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,140
-坚持住  -不行了  好疼
- And keep holding on. - No, that hurts.

177
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,150
坚持住
Keep holding.

178
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,920
我做不到  我不行了
I can't, I can't.

179
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
坚持住
Keep holding.

180
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,980
坐起来
Sit up.

181
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,330
好了吗
Is it...

182
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,370
好了
Yeah.

183
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,480
还会酸痛几天
It's gonna be sore for a few days.

184
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,290
离开了温室之后  你们就来这儿了吗
After the greenhouse, you came here?

185
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,870
是的  我们以为这儿挺安全的
Yeah. We thought it was clear.

186
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,570
我们没发现那些穿着睡衣的活死人
We missed the deadie in the PJs,

187
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,250
所以不得已冲进了卫生间躲着
so we dove into the bathroom.

188
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,630
那在我们来之前
So how long were you up there

189
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,510
你们在里面躲了多久了
till we showed up?

190
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,990
大概两天吧
Like, two days.

191
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,410
这儿只有一个行尸  你们还有枪
There was just one. You had guns.

192
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,000
我们只剩大约十二发子弹了
We have about 12 bullets.

193
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,450
而我们一般得开五六枪才能放到一个
It usually take us about five or six to bring one of them down.

194
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,160
但是你们有刀子啊
But you have knives.

195
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,110
那要怎样  一刀扎进脑子里吗
To what, stab it in the head?

196
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,460
是的
Yeah.

197
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,950
大约一周前我们和伙伴们分散了
We got separated from our crew about a week ago.

198
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,770
因为只剩我们俩了  所以我们一直小心翼翼的
Been trying to play it safe since it's just the two of us.

199
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,970
-我的腿伤了  所以必须谨慎  -是啊
- I have to with my leg. - Yeah.

200
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,910
我们当时住在一个难民营
We were at a refugee center together

201
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,370
结果那儿起火了
and there was a fire.

202
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,010
人们从我身上踏了过去
People were just trampling over me.

203
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,350
真是群混蛋
Assholes.

204
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,330
萨姆救了我一命
Sam saved my life.

205
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,030
我们之前并不认识彼此
We didn't know each other before.

206
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,410
虽然我的腿没治好  但也算伤愈了
It didn't heal right, but it healed.

207
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,430
而且我们找到了彼此
And we found each other.

208
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,010
受伤也值得了
It was worth it.

209
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,590
接下来你俩要去哪里
Where are you two headed next?

210
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,230
我们会不停地换地方
We just keep moving.

211
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,770
我们不会等到一个地方待不下去了才走
We haven't been waiting for places to go bad.

212
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,630
我是说  那已经行不通了
I mean, it's getting a little old.

213
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,140
你们看起来还不错
You guys look all right.

214
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,680
你们的落脚地什么样
What's your setup like?

215
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,460
嗜皮者
The "Skin-eaters"?

216
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,620
我们叫它们行尸
We call them walkers.

217
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,780
瑞克的三个问题

218
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,780
你们杀过多少行尸
How many have you killed?

219
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,110
欢迎来到乔治亚州  生人勿扰

220
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,290
跟上
Come on.

221
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,730
找到了
Here we go.

222
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,140
电池看起来挺干
Hmm, cells look pretty dry.

223
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,250
补点蒸馏水就行了
A little distilled water will clear that right up.

224
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,100
你应该放手的
You should have let him go.

225
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,610
说得好像你很懂似的
The hell you know about it, huh?

226
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,910
-你他妈是专家吗  -不是
- You the damn expert? - No.

227
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,930
我只是不想看你送死
I just don't want to see you die.

228
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,630
这是你的目的吗
Is that what you're trying to do?

229
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,920
你知道自己在干什么吗
Do you even know what you're trying to do?

230
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,740
我知道你很恼火
I know you're pissed.

231
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,200
你有理由愤怒
And you have every reason to be.

232
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,170
但愤怒只会让你变得愚蠢
But anger makes you stupid.

233
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,520
而愚蠢会害死你自己
Stupid gets you killed.

234
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,190
你难道不是还对总督愤怒吗
Aren't you still angry about the Governor?

235
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,330
对他的所作所为
What he did?

236
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,070
如果他现在在这儿的话
If he was here right now,

237
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,660
我会把他砍成两截
I'd cut him in two.

238
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,170
因为他罪有应得
'Cause that's how it needs to be.

239
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,630
但我不愤怒
But I'm not angry.

240
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,790
我曾经愤怒
I was.

241
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,190
那你为什么还要出去找他
Then why are you still going out looking for him?

242
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,950
我不知道
I don't know.

243
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,360
真恶心
That's puke.

244
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,780
防冻冷却液

245
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,410
那些蔓藤里的傻瓜是自杀的
Those douchebags in the vines took themselves out,

246
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,110
手拉着手
holding hands--

247
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,130
高唱圣歌
kumbaya style.

248
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,830
他们希望死后跟生前一样相聚
They wanted to go out together same as they lived.

249
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,430
这算傻么
That make them douchebags?

250
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,520
算  他们本能逃生的
It does if they could have gotten out.

251
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,180
所有人都会努力求生
Everybody makes it,

252
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,890
直到他们撑不下去
till they don't.

253
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,110
如今人们就像多米诺骨牌
People nowadays are dominoes.

254
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,250
他们也许只是不想看着同伴倒下
What they did, maybe it's about not having to watch them fall.

255
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,390
好吧
Right.

256
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,570
快来
Come on.

257
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,240
该拿的差不多都拿了
We got about all we're gonna get here.

258
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,730
我们该走了
We should move on.

259
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,250
我们通过你的测试了吗
So, did we pass your test?

260
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,180
我们在向北八英里的一座监狱扎营
We're in a prison eight miles north.

261
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,390
如果你们跟我们回去
If you come back with us,

262
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,630
我们无法保证你们的安全
we can't guarantee your safety.

263
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,230
我们那里爆发了一种流感
There's an illness, a flu.

264
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
情况非常糟
It's bad.

265
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,020
我们已经失去了很多人
We've lost a lot.

266
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,350
-还有孩子  -你们俩的孩子吗
- Kids, too. - Yours?

267
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,880
不是  谢天谢地
No, thank God.

268
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,150
但我有一个姑娘被感染了
But one of my girls, she's got it.

269
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,980
-很抱歉  -她很坚强  会挺过去的
- I'm sorry. - She's strong. She'll make it.

270
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,530
你们有护栏和围墙
You got fences and walls?

271
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,280
那我们愿意加入
We're in.

272
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,830
对  让我们做什么都行
Yeah, whatever you need us to do.

273
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,990
现在  你们就在这待着
For now, sit tight.

274
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,650
天黑前我们会回来接你们
The two of us will circle back for you before dark.

275
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,040
或者你们可以帮忙搜索一下周围的房子
Or you could help us sweep the rest of this neighborhood.

276
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,010
没问题  我可以去看看温室
We can do that. I can check the greenhouse,

277
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,500
如果没什么情况  我就多摘点水果
see if it's clear, bring back more fruit.

278
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,190
我也可以去搜索一些房子
And I can hit some of the houses.

279
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,850
谢谢你们愿意帮忙
Well, it's nice of you to offer,

280
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,630
但你的肩膀还
but your shoulder's barely--

281
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,970
只要我这边胳膊不用力就没事
As long as I don't put too much weight on this arm, I'm good.

282
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,520
-我还能走得挺快  -我不觉得...
- And I can still move pretty fast. - I just don't think--

283
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,620
我们不会冒险的
We won't take any chances.

284
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,700
我们会仔细观察  时机合适就动手
We'll look. And if it's cake, we'll do it.

285
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,340
要是不合适  我们就撤
If not, we'll just roll.

286
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,060
你自己看起来也不太好呢  伙计
I mean, you don't look so good yourself, man.

287
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,990
你惯用右手还是左手
Are you a righty or a lefty?

288
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,420
这能扩大我们的搜索范围
We'll cover more ground.

289
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,930
让我们更早回去
The sooner we get back...

290
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,060
你没法守着我们
You can't carry us, man.

291
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,280
-那样行不通  -拜托  我们想帮忙
- It doesn't work that way. - Please, we want to help.

292
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,650
只要你们鸣枪  我们立刻就赶回来
You fire a shot, we'll come running.

293
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,490
我们两小时后还在这里碰面
Let's meet back here in two hours.

294
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,120
你会需要这个的
You'll need this.

295
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,300
你从没提起过以前所在的队伍
You never told us about the group you were with before.

296
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,650
哪一队
Which one?

297
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,550
跟你说  你在路上碰到我的时候
You know, when you found me out on that road,

298
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,240
我差一点就走开了
I almost kept walking.

299
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,830
为什么
Why is that?

300
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,890
因为我看够了一幕幕惨剧
'Cause I was done being a witness.

301
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,200
前后两次  跟两支不同的队伍
Two times, two different groups.

302
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,800
我都是唯一的幸存者
I was the last one standing.

303
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,970
好像我就必须一次次见证这些
Like I was supposed to see it happen over and over,

304
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,760
就像诅咒一样
like it's some kind of curse.

305
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,620
当你一个人在寂静的世界生存...
But, when it's just you out there with the quiet...

306
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,300
晚上只有喝上一瓶
used to be I'd drink a bottle of anything

307
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,610
才能闭眼昏睡
just so I could shut my eyes at night.

308
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,270
我以为在监狱里  有人群陪伴会容易些
Figured the prison, the people, thought it'd be easier.

309
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,350
那次去基地搜索  我纯粹是为了自己
The run to the Big Spot, I did it for me.

310
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,570
总得要有点事干
You gotta keep busy.

311
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,290
不  我去是为了弄瓶酒
No. I did it so I could get me a bottle.

312
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,490
什么酒都行
Of anything.

313
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,900
我把酒拿起来  握在手里
I picked it up, I held it in my hand,

314
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,410
但最终我又放下了
but I put it down.

315
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,880
我放下酒瓶时太用力
I put it down so hard

316
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,520
整个房顶都跟着塌了下来
it took the whole damn shelf with it.

317
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,450
所以才引来了行尸
That's what brought on the walkers,

318
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,430
所以扎克才会死
and that's what got Zack killed.

319
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,320
瞎扯
That's bullshit.

320
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,370
你进车里试试发动引擎吧
Why don't you get in there and try the engine?

321
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,060
就是一根红色和绿色的电线
It's a red and a green wire.

322
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,620
快去  又不是什么高科技
Go on. It ain't rocket science.

323
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,880
踩点油门
Give it some gas.

324
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,290
萨沙和我选了那个基地
Sasha and me picked that spot.

325
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,290
他带你一起去的
He took you with us.

326
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,570
没人能预见到那些事
There ain't no way anybody could've known.

327
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,410
你不再是独自一人
You ain't gonna be standing alone,

328
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,020
再也不会  咱们走吧
not no more. Let's go.

329
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,190
起码都过期了一年
It's all expired by at least a year.

330
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,690
还是拿着吧  让赫谢尔决定他要什么
Better to take it. Let Herschel decide what he needs.

331
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,320
你觉得这样做对吗
Did you think it was right?

332
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,710
让那些孩子跟我们一起回去
Letting those kids come back with us?

333
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,310
这样做才人道
I think it was the humane thing to do.

334
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,410
但你觉得这样对吗
But did you think it was right?

335
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,510
看看我们
Look at us.

336
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,250
翻箱倒柜  希望
Digging through drawers, hoping that...

337
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,320
借着一些止咳糖和消毒剂
a couple of cough drops and some disinfectant might be the difference

338
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,870
让人多活几个小时
between dying and living a couple of more hours.

339
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,650
如果他们能帮我们渡过难关
If they're strong enough to help us survive this thing,

340
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,190
那么没错  我认为你的决定是正确的
yeah, I think you made the right call.

341
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,620
如果不行呢
And if they're not?

342
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,460
希望他们能吧
Let's hope they are.

343
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,040
是啊 
Yeah.

344
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,540
瑞克
Rick...

345
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,290
我杀了两个人  可你只字不提
I killed two people and you haven't said a word about it.

346
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,760
你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say?

347
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,590
重点不是你说什么
It's not about what you say.

348
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,750
而是要去面对现实
It's about facing reality.

349
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,460
现实总是来势汹汹  而一次又一次
It always comes for us and over and over again

350
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,860
我们唯有面对现实  才得以生存
we face it so that we can live.

351
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,330
-这只是为了我们能生存  -没错
- So that we can live. - That's right.

352
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,450
归根结底就是这一目标而已
That's what it always comes down to.

353
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,310
你可以当农民  瑞克
You can be a farmer, Rick.

354
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,770
但不能只是个农民
You can't just be a farmer.

355
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,130
你是位出色的领袖
You're a good leader.

356
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,230
比我想象的还要出色
Better than I probably gave you credit for.

357
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,170
我从没杀过两个自己人
I never murdered two of our own.

358
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,580
只有一个
Just one.

359
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,240
他要杀了我
He was gonna kill me.

360
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,810
他们也是
So were they.

361
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,410
他们会把我们所有人都杀死
They were gonna kill all of us.

362
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,940
这你没法知道
You don't know that.

363
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,840
如果你认为这样能救朱迪思或卡尔
If you thought it would save Judith or Carl,

364
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,710
你会这样做吗
would you have done it then

365
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,180
还是回去种庄稼
or would you have just gone back to your crops

366
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,190
希望一切都会没事
and hoped it'd all be okay?

367
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,500
你没必要喜欢我的所作所为  瑞克
You don't have to like what I did, Rick.

368
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,670
我也不喜欢
I don't.

369
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,000
你只要接受就行了
You just accept it.

370
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,220
看起来我们快到了
Looks like we're getting closer.

371
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,660
我们要找的楼房就在前面
The building we want is just up ahead.

372
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,740
学习资料中心

373
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,600
走吧  走吧
Come on. Come on.

374
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,870
好了  咱们速战速决
All right, let's make this quick.

375
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,260
就是这些
There you go.

376
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,730
还有这个
Here.

377
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,200
走
Come on.

378
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,780
去街对面的房子看看
Let's hit the houses across the street.

379
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,570
等会
Hold on.

380
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,010
你怎么会治肩膀脱臼呢
How'd you put his shoulder back before?

381
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,250
跟赫谢尔学的吗
You learn that from Herschel?

382
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,870
网上学的
Internet.

383
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,100
这样总比骗急诊护士说我第三次从楼梯上跌落好些
It's easier than telling an ER nurse I'd fallen down the stairs a third time.

384
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,060
抱歉
I'm sorry.

385
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,950
没事  自己动手丰衣足食
Don't be. Just fixed what needed fixin'.

386
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,410
我其实还说服过自己  和他一起生活是快乐的
I actually convinced myself I was happy with him.

387
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,960
想到至少不是孤苦伶仃
Which wasn't all that hard to do

388
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,650
这事也就显得没那么困难了
considering my idea of happiness then was just not being alone.

389
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,260
起码能过个像样的日子
Made a decent living.

390
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,640
他有心的时候  还是很有魅力的
He was charming when he wanted to be,

391
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,670
尤其是那些他酩酊大醉后醒来的早上  他会...
especially those mornings after he'd come home piss-drunk and...

392
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,490
我太傻了
Stupid.

393
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,910
愚蠢透顶
Stupid.

394
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,540
那时我觉得自己无法坚强起来
I didn't think I could be strong.

395
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,420
感觉完全做不到
I didn't know I could.

396
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,010
可我现在做到了
I already was.

397
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,330
你为什么都不说她的名字
Why don't you say her name?

398
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,640
她已经死了  瑞克
She's dead, Rick.

399
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,760
索菲亚
Sophia.

400
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,350
死了
Dead.

401
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,960
已成昨日之梦
Somebody else's slideshow.

402
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,880
有时早晨醒来我会期望洛莉还在
Some mornings I still wake up half-expecting Lori to be there.

403
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,830
提醒我去接卡尔放学
Reminding me to pick up Carl after school

404
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,730
叫我准备吃早餐
or telling me breakfast is ready.

405
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,620
每周日她都会给我们做烤薄饼  简直...
Every Sunday she'd make us these pancakes that were just...

406
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,560
难吃到要死
godawful.

407
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,830
面粉和得也不对劲儿
Clumps of flour that weren't mixed in right.

408
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,470
问题是...
Thing was...

409
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,410
她自己也知道难吃
she knew it was bad.

410
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
那她为什么还做啊
Why'd she keep at it?

411
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,520
她就是...
Well...

412
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,810
希望跟别人家一样
she wanted us to be the kind of family

413
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,810
周末吃顿薄煎饼才像一家人
that ate pancakes on Sunday.

414
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,500
我们该回去了
We should get back.

415
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,380
萨姆应该在等了
Sam is probably waiting.

416
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:32,150
所有叫"西林"或者"林"的药  通通都拿走
Anything ending with -cillin or -cin, C-I-N, grab it.

417
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,160
把药溶进点滴里
We'll dissolve the pills in the IVs,

418
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,840
直接静脉注射
put 'em right into the bloodstream.

419
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,600
剂量不太好定  但是考虑到拖延的时间太长
Dosage will be tricky but considering the time we lost...

420
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,590
你们怎么样  
How'd you do?

421
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,660
输液袋  输液管  夹子  连接头都有了
Bags, tubes, clamps, connectors.

422
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,030
-单子上的都有了  -你们这边呢
- Everything on the list. - What about y'all?

423
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,020
都搞定了
Yeah, we got it all.

424
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,920
都好了
Yeah. We're good.

425
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,380
好的  走吧
All right, let's roll.

426
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,190
出口

427
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,570
前面
Up ahead.

428
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,630
门坏了关不上
Hey! Door's busted.

429
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,240
挡住
Oh. Hold up.

430
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,140
楼梯

431
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,570
这边
There.

432
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,290
-有多少  -看不出来
- How many? - I can't tell.

433
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,240
-我们可以干掉它们  -不要
- We can take 'em. - No!

434
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,760
它们被感染了  和监狱里一样
They're infected. Same as at the prison.

435
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,310
我们干掉它们  血溅满身  再吸进去
We fire at 'em, get their blood on us, breathe it in.

436
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,970
我们大老远来这不是为了被感染的
We didn't come all this way to get sick.

437
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,290
我们怎么知道它们是不是一样呢
How do we know the ones in there aren't any different?

438
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,950
-我们不知道  -总得想办法出去
- We don't. - Well, it's gotta change sometime.

439
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,780
准备好了吗
Ready?

440
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,720
动手
Do it!

441
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,900
快走
Come on.

442
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,300
太久了
It's been too long.

443
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,390
我们应该再给他点时间
We should give him a couple more.

444
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,090
他也许没事
He might be fine.

445
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,990
真的有可能
He really might be.

446
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,790
但是已不重要了
But it doesn't matter...

447
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,760
因为他现在不在这  而我们得走了
because he's not here... and we have to go.

448
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,410
可惜了一块好表
It was a nice watch.

449
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,120
-退后  -没有出口
- Back. - Don't have an exit.

450
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,980
我们打一个出来
Then we make one.

451
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,110
躲开
Get down!

452
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,240
-快点  快走  -跳到下面的走道上
- Come on, move it! - Jump down to the walkway below.

453
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,380
-它们过来了  -快走  快
- They're here! - Let's go! Go, go. Move.

454
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,040
鲍勃  放手
Bob, let it go.

455
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,920
别管了  老兄
Let it go, man.

456
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,210
放手吧
Just let it go.

457
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,220
别要那个包了  老兄
Let go of the bag, man.

458
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,030
你的包里没有药
You got no meds in your bag?

459
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,200
只有这个吗
Just this?

460
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,910
那天你应该直接走开
You should have kept walking that day.

461
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,880
不要
Don't.

462
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,510
就这样吧  达里尔
Just let it go, Daryl.

463
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,880
他做出了自己的选择
The man's made his choice.

464
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,780
你无法改变
Nothing you can do about it.

465
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,340
就这样吧
Just gotta let it go.

466
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,230
我不想伤害谁
I didn't want to hurt nobody.

467
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,930
只是为了排解那可怕的寂静
It was just for when it gets quiet.

468
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,640
把药拿回去之前  你要胆敢喝一口
Take one sip. When those meds get in our people,

469
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,600
我会打得你满地找牙
I will beat your ass into the ground.

470
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,500
听见了吗
You hear me?

471
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,050
他们也许能活下来
They might have lived.

472
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,780
凯伦和大卫  他们也许能活下来
Karen and David, they might have lived,

473
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,520
现在他们死了
and now they're dead.

474
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,870
你不能决定他人生死
That wasn't your decision to make.

475
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,830
如果泰尔西发现了
When Tyreese finds out...

476
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,370
他会杀了你
he'll kill you.

477
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,980
他差点都把我杀了
He damn near killed me over nothing.

478
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,630
我能应付泰尔西
I can handle Tyreese.

479
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,550
如果其他人知道了
When the others find out,

480
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,170
他们不会让你留下的
they won't want you there.

481
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,600
就算他们没能回来
And if they don't make it back,

482
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,480
就算大家都因疫病而死  只剩下我们俩
if everybody dies of this thing and it's just the two of us,

483
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,670
还有我的孩子  朱迪思和卡尔
with Judith and Carl-- with my children...

484
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,280
我也不会让你留下
I won't have you there.

485
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,860
瑞克  是我啊
Rick, it's me.

486
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,580
别人不需要知道的
No one else has to know.

487
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,590
我以为你不会再替大家做决定了
I thought you were done making decisions for everyone.

488
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,350
我这是为了自己
I'm making this decision for me.

489
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,580
我本可以假装一切都会好转
I could have pretended that everything was gonna be fine.

490
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,730
但我没有
But I didn't.

491
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,770
我出手了  我挺身而出
I did something. I stepped up.

492
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,780
我必须这么做
I had to do something.

493
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,030
不  你不必
No, you didn't.

494
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,970
我绝不会留下丽兹和米卡...
If you think I'm going anywhere without Lizzie and Mica--

495
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,560
你想让她们离开  跟你一起走吗
If you want them to leave, to go out there with you?

496
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,660
丽兹病了  米卡才十岁
Lizzie's sick. Mica is 10 years old.

497
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,990
她不行的
She can't.

498
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,680
我们会保护她们
We'll keep them safe.

499
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,320
你已经不再是那个害怕孤独的女人了  不再是了
You're not that woman who was too scared to be alone, not anymore.

500
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,810
你可以重新开始  找到其他人
You're gonna start over, find others,

501
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,330
不知道你过去的人
people who don't know,

502
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,870
你能在外面生存下去
and you're gonna survive out here.

503
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,910
你能的
You will.

504
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,720
也许吧
Maybe.

505
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,630
我本来准备走100号高速路
That's where I was traveling, Highway 100.

506
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,750
去那里需要花七小时
Then it will take about seven hours to get there.

507
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,030
我们需要更多汽油
We're gonna need more gas.

508
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,090
但我们会到的
But we'll get there.

509
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,910
-我们走100号高速  -听到了
- Taking Highway 100. - I heard.

510
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,860
你之前的话没错
You were right, what you said before.

511
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,350
我的确找不到他了
About the trail going cold.

512
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,040
我不用再出去了
I don't need to go out anymore.

513
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,230
很好
Good.

514
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,040
拿上吧
Take it.

515
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,090
爱德在我们结婚一周年时给我的
Ed gave this to me on our first anniversary.

516
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,040
拜托了
Please.

517
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,030
我早就该送人了
I should have given it away a long time ago.

518
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,420
? It was a close call ?

519
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,370
? Sitting in the back of the room ?

520
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,150
? with a ball I had thrown at you ?

521
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,670
? And you didn't know ?

522
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,400
? Close in on my black eye ?

523
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,890
? I feel safe at times ?

524
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,600
? Certain emblems ?

525
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,630
? Tell me it's time ?

526
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,700
? Cerpents in my mind ?

527
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,460
? Looking for your ?

528
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,020
? crimes ?

529
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,380
? Everything changes ?

530
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,990
? I don't want mine ?

531
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:12,250
? this time ?

532
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,390
? Everything changes ?
