1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,770
我得说服你们做一件事
I have to talk all of you into doing something.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,030
我知道我们必须这样做
Something I know we need to do.

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,650
我不知道该如何开口
And I don't know how to talk about it.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,500
你想让我们做什么
What do you want us to do?

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,610
我想让你们活下去
I want you to survive.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,630
我们在这里撑不了多久
We're not gonna last here.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,520
行尸会成群结队地来袭
The biters, there'll be a herd of them.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,290
它们会填满坑
They'll fill the pits,

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,970
一个叠一个
they'll crawl over one another.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,700
前赴后继  最后入侵我们的营地
There'll be enough to tear right through our camp.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,740
它们不来活人也会来
Or it'll be people.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,390
我们和外面的世界之间没有阻碍
There's nothing between us and the rest of the world.

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,530
我们和他们之间毫无阻碍
Nothing between us and them.

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,650
我们留在这里  就会死
We stay here, we'll die.

15
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,010
摧毁了我和马丁内斯所在的营地的那些人
The people who destroyed the camp I was in with Martinez...

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,780
他们住在一座监狱里
they live in a prison.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,200
在34号高速公路以北
It's north off Highway 34.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,680
他们有围墙
They got walls...

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,020
栅栏
fences,

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,170
可供耕种的土地
plots of land for farming.

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,130
我们可以住在那里
We could live there.

22
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,510
如果我们愿意从他们手上抢过来的话
If we're willing to take it from 'em.

23
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,580
我有个计划  可以避免任何人受伤
I have a plan to do it without anyone getting hurt.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,060
我抓获了他们的两个人
I captured two of them.

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,110
什么
What?

26
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,350
我当时在侦查监狱
I was scouting the prison

27
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,660
碰上了他们  所以我把他们带回来了
and our paths crossed, so I took 'em.

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,880
-你带回了他们  -他们是进监狱的钥匙
- You took them? - They're the key.

29
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,810
他们会帮我们不费一枪一弹夺取那座监狱
They're gonna help us take that prison without firing a shot.

30
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,390
我们能得到监狱  而且不必杀人
We can have it and we don't need to kill anyone.

31
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,480
但是
But...

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,520
我们得做好杀人的准备
we need to be prepared to.

监狱里的那些人并非都是坏人
The people in this prison, not all of them are bad.

42
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,430
但大部分都是小偷
But most of them are thieves,

43
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,550
谋杀犯
murderers.

44
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,300
为什么那种人能逍遥自在
Now why should people like that have peace of mind

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,430
而我们却每天都在掩埋同伴
when we're burying our own just about every day?

46
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,530
那些人致我残疾
These people, they mutilated me...

47
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,420
烧了我的营地
burned my camp...

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,400
杀了我女儿
killed my daughter.

49
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,200
你看见了  我尝试过
Now you saw me-- I tried.

50
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,750
我尝试过去死
I tried to die.

51
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,270
因为我不想接受  在这世界存活
'Cause I didn't want to accept that you couldn't live in this world

52
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,750
就必须杀人这一事实
without getting blood on your hands.

53
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,020
但我找到了你们  我不想死了
I found you people and I don't want to die.

54
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,350
我也不想让你们死
I don't want you to die.

55
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,580
我们得马上行动
Now we need to move-- now.

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,010
他们会发觉他们的人失踪了
They're gonna realize their people are gone

57
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,970
会为接下来的事做好准备
and they're gonna start getting ready for whatever's next.

58
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,610
我们得攻其不备  吓到他们
We need to surprise them. Scare them.

59
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,010
我们会赢的
And we will win.

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,890
我加入
I'm in.

61
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,470
-我加入  -我也是
- I'm in. - Me, too.

62
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,110
收拾东西  做好准备
Pack up and get ready.

63
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,900
半小时后我们定计划
We'll go over the plan in half an hour.

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,840
-走吧  -就这么做吧
- Come on. - Let's do it.

65
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,880
梅根在哪
Where's Megan?

66
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,950
她在拖车里看书
She's reading in the trailer.

67
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,970
你都听到了吗
You hear all that?

68
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,410
我说过我们不必抢另一个地方
I said we didn't have to fight for another place.

69
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,430
我知道
I know.

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,870
要杀人吗
Killing people?

71
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,550
不  杀谋杀犯
No. Killing killers.

72
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,710
你说过他们不全是坏人
You said they weren't all bad people.

73
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,250
他们和坏人在一起
Well, they're with bad people.

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,960
我也是吗
Am I?

75
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,520
我会让你活下去的
I'm gonna keep you alive.

76
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,040
我会让梅根活下去的
I'm gonna keep Megan alive.

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,200
我唯一在乎的
The only judgment on me I care about

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,180
就是你俩是不是活着
is whether you two are still breathing.

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,290
你听到了很好
It's good that you heard,

80
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,120
你知道了很好
that you know.

81
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,600
莉莉  我爱你
Lily... I love you.

82
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,390
我不知道你到底是谁
I don't know who you are.

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,580
你和我说过一定还有更好的地方
Hey, you told me there has to be someplace better

84
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,590
还叫我帮你找到它
and that I was gonna help you find it.

85
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,530
你了解我  莉莉
You knew me, Lily.

86
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,620
我是不会变的
It was always gonna be like this.

87
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,980
你也得收拾收拾了
You need to pack up, too.

88
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,600
-别碰我  -别动
- Don't touch me. - Stay still.

89
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,290
离我远点
Get off me.

90
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,610
你们应该吃点东西  今天将会是漫长的一天
You should eat. It's gonna be a long day.

91
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,010
没有人会伤害你们的
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

92
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,070
我可不信
I don't believe that.

93
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,610
我不在乎
Well, I don't care.

94
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,250
你就告诉我们这是怎么回事吧
Just tell us what this is.

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,540
拜托了
Please.

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,210
这不是私人恩怨
It isn't personal.

97
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,330
那这是什么
Then what is it?

98
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,780
米琼恩  我想让你明白
Michonne, I want you to know...

99
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,390
佩妮  我的女儿
Penny, my daughter,

100
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,100
她死了  我如今意识到了这一点
she was dead. I know that now.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,480
现在  我不想伤害你
Now, I don't want to hurt you.

102
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,890
我不想伤害任何人
I don't want to hurt anyone.

103
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,540
我只要监狱  就这么简单
I need the prison, that's it.

104
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,370
有一伙人的性命我得保住
There are people I need to keep alive.

105
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,260
你俩要帮我夺得监狱
You two are gonna help me take it.

106
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,580
不会有伤亡
No one needs to die.

107
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,810
我要杀了你
I'm gonna kill you.

108
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,330
不  你不会的
No, you won't.

109
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,970
-我会用我的...  -别说了
- I'm gonna take my-- - Stop it.

110
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,410
度假好去处

111
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,300
你想要监狱
You want the prison?

112
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,580
是的  而且我会尽可能和平地接管它
Yeah. And I'll take it as peacefully as I can.

113
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,080
-总督  -别那样叫我
- Governor-- - Don't call me that.

114
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,550
你的人  还有我们的人
Your people, our people,

115
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,370
我们能找到一个和平共处的办法
we can find a way to live together.

116
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,180
这些你要护着的人
These people you need to keep alive,

117
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,500
你爱他们吗
do you love them?

118
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,780
你是个好人  赫谢尔
You're a good man, Hershel.

119
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,390
比瑞克要好
A better man than Rick.

120
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,170
你说的每一句话  你说话的方式
Everything you've said, the way you've said it,

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,330
证明你变了  而瑞克也变了
you've changed. So has Rick.

122
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,140
我们俩永远也不可能生活在一起的
The two of us will never be able to live together.

123
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,670
米琼恩和我  我们也不可能生活在一起
Michonne and I, we'll never be able to live together.

124
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,600
-我们会找到办法的  -我已经找到了
- We'll find a way. - I found a way!

125
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,700
我很努力了
I'm trying hard.

126
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,130
我有各种各样的办法能达到目的
There's all kinds of ways I could do this.

127
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,640
而这个办法  你们能活下去  而我能...
This way, you get to live and I get to be...

128
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,360
你说你想尽可能和平地接管这个监狱
You say you want to take this prison as peacefully as possible.

129
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,650
那意味着为了夺得它你也不惜伤害一些人
That means you'd be willing to hurt people to get it.

130
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,210
我的女儿们在那儿
My daughters would be there.

131
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,560
你有可能伤害到她们
That's who you'd be hurting.

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,250
假如你真理解有个女儿的感觉
If you understand what it's like to have a daughter,

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,350
那你怎么能威胁别人女儿的性命
then how can you threaten to kill someone else's?

134
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,750
因为她们不是我的女儿
Because they aren't mine.

135
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,380
我们回来前他们会安全地待在这儿
They'll be safe here until we get back.

136
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,240
行尸没办法过河
Biters can't make it across the water.

137
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,100
假如在水边很安全的话
If it's safe by the water,

138
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,740
那我们就直接找个靠水的地方啊
then let's just go someplace by the water.

139
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,810
-莉莉  -你没必要这么做
- Lily. - You don't have to do this.

140
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,280
任何安全的地方  真正安全的地方
Anyplace that's safe, really safe,

141
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,860
都已经被人占了
someone's already there.

142
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,010
为梅根想想  好吗
Think about Megan, huh?

143
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,170
我想过
I am.

144
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,360
她在这样的一个世界上会变成什么样
What's she gonna be in this world?

145
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,730
她会成为幸存者
She's gonna be alive.

146
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,850
在做泥巴馅饼呢
Making mud pies?

147
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,100
花生酱三明治
Peanut butter sandwiches.

148
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,390
在我走之前抱抱我怎样
How about a hug before I go?

149
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,240
我手上都是泥巴
My hands are muddy. See?

150
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,110
的确
Oh, yeah.

151
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,770
好吧  我可不想把我的外套弄脏
Well, I wouldn't want to get my coat dirty.

152
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,460
我把你弄得一团糟
I messed it all up.

153
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,940
没有  你让我更好了
No, you made it better.

154
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,120
我真想度个假
I could use a vacation.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,390
出去散散心
Get away.

156
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,300
一个周末就好
Just for a weekend.

157
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,400
是啊
Yeah.

158
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,570
我们的周年纪念日快到了
You know, our anniversary is coming up.

159
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,450
是吗
It is?

160
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,870
就这几天
One of these days.

161
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,150
你去过阿米科罗拉瀑布吗
You ever been to Amicalola Falls?

162
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,140
乔治亚最高的瀑布
Tallest waterfall in Georgia.

163
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,850
小时候我爸爸带我去过
My dad took me there when I was little.

164
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,740
我们站在顶端的时候
When we were up there,

165
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,050
从上往下看
all the way at the top looking down,

166
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,120
我感觉像是在飞一样
I felt like I was flying.

167
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,320
我现在就去给旅行车装行李
I'll go load up the station wagon.

168
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,310
我去给你拿点水喝
I'm gonna get you some water.

169
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,090
-我能去拿  -我知道
- I can get it. - I know.

170
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,370
但是我要去
But I'm doing it.

171
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,740
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

172
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,000
你就不能等我们回来再处理这事吗
Man, you couldn't have waited till we got back?

173
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,970
等泰尔西回来吗
Until Tyreese got back?

174
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,510
我能应付他
I could've handled that.

175
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,520
她杀了两个自己人
She killed two of our own.

176
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,390
她不能待在这里
She couldn't be here.

177
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,760
她会没事的
She's gonna be all right.

178
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,250
她有一辆车  供给品还有武器
She has a car, supplies, weapons.

179
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,880
她...她能活下去
She's a survivor.

180
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,930
这话连你自己都不相信
Stop saying that like you don't believe it.

181
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,650
她杀了人  她说是为了我们大家
She did it. She said it was for us.

182
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,120
她就是那么想的
That's how it was in her head.

183
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,860
她不觉得愧疚
She wasn't sorry.

184
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,980
她是这样  但这不是她的本性
Man, that's her, but that ain't her.

185
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,900
那两个小女孩怎么办
What are we supposed to do about those two girls?

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,670
我告诉她我们会照顾她们
I told her we'd look after them.

187
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,880
我还没有告诉泰尔西
I haven't told Tyreese yet.

188
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,140
我不知道他会有什么反应
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

189
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,660
我们去看看就得了
Let's go find out.

190
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,340
鲍勃
Bob.

191
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,850
你应该休息
You should be resting.

192
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,830
折腾了一晚上  你也应该休息了
After the night you had, so should you.

193
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,750
我要休息
I'm going to.

194
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,190
我正要去C区找一个空狱房
On my way to find an open cell in C block

195
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,720
直到D区被收拾干净了
until D gets cleaned up.

196
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,600
我只想说
I just wanted to say

197
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,510
谢谢
thank you.

198
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,600
如果不是赫谢尔跟你的话
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Hershel

199
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,260
我不会活着
and you.

200
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,480
多亏了赫谢尔  不是我
Hershel, not me.

201
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,210
-你也帮忙了  -别说了
- You helped save my life. - Stop.

202
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,220
-鲍勃  -别说了
- Bob. - Stop.

203
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,770
你把那些药放到了我的输液里
You put those meds in my IV bag.

204
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,670
现在  还有几分钟
And now, in a couple minutes,

205
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,100
我就能看到明天的太阳了
I'm gonna feel the sun on my skin.

206
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,660
所以你得让我谢谢你
So you are gonna let me thank you.

207
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,120
萨沙
Sasha.

208
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,360
你还没有完全恢复
You're not strong enough yet.

209
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,660
那就帮帮我
Then help me.

210
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,690
泰尔西  你在吗
Tyreese. You down here?

211
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,630
瑞克  是你吗
Rick, that you?

212
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,350
你们得来看看
You guys got to see this.

213
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,650
能一会儿再去吗  我们得先谈谈
Can we take a beat? There's something we need to talk about.

214
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,350
那个不着急  先过来
It can wait. Come on.

215
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,350
看
Look.

216
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,120
怎么回事
The hell?

217
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,360
我刚才在找
I was just looking for...

218
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,380
答案
answers...

219
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,000
然后我发现了这个
and I found this.

220
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,610
是杀掉凯伦和大卫的人干的
Same person that killed Karen and David did this.

221
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,940
还记得栅栏那里的老鼠吗
Remember the rats at the fence?

222
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,370
它们是在她被杀当天出现的
They showed up the same day she was killed.

223
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,550
我们队伍里有个变态
We got a psychopath living with us.

224
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,540
-泰尔西  -我们得找到他  瑞克
- Tyreese. - We got to find him, Rick.

225
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,920
不找到他我决不罢休
And I'm not gonna sleep until we do.

226
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,950
泰尔西
Tyreese...

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,760
干这事的
whoever did this,

228
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,650
恐怕不是杀死凯伦的凶手
I don't think that's who killed Karen.

229
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,030
为什么
Why?

230
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,870
快走
Come on.

231
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,770
退后
Get back!

232
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,580
瑞克
Rick!

233
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,940
过来吧
Come down here.

234
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,340
我们谈谈
We need to talk.

235
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,750
我做不了主
It's not up to me.

236
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,440
我们有委员会  由他们管理这里
There's a council now. They run this place.

237
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,530
委员会里有赫谢尔吗
Is Hershel on the council?

238
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,790
还有米琼恩呢
What about Michonne?

239
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,360
委员会也有她吗
She on the council, too?

240
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,290
这里不再由我做决定了
I don't make decisions anymore.

241
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,340
今天你得做  瑞克
You're making the decisions today, Rick.

242
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,030
过来  我们谈谈吧
Come down here. Let's have that talk.

243
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,120
我们能行  好吗
We can do this. All right?

244
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,250
我们对付不了这么多人
We can't take 'em all on.

245
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,870
咱们按照之前计划的
We'll go through the admin building,

246
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,690
穿过管理楼进入林子  
through the woods like we planned.

247
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,830
我们现在没有人数优势了
We ain't got the numbers no more.

248
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,800
上次查大巴上的补给是什么时候
When's the last time someone checked the stash on the bus?

249
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,450
我们去基地的前一天
Day before we hit the Big Spot.

250
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,050
那时我们的口粮不多  现在更少了
We were running low on rations then. We're lower now.

251
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,210
我们会想到办法的  如果情况不妙
Yeah, we'll manage. Things go south,

252
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,510
通知大家  都上大巴
everyone heads for that bus. Let everybody know.

253
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,000
如果情况不妙却没人知道呢
What if everybody doesn't know when things go bad?

254
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,580
我们要等多久
How long do we wait?

255
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,950
尽可能多等一会儿
As long as we can.

256
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,460
现在就放他们走
Let 'em go right now.

257
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,490
我留下
I'll stay down here.

258
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,110
你想谈多久就谈多久
Talk as long as you want.

259
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,000
但你得放他们走
But you let 'em go.

260
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,850
你有坦克  完全不需要人质
You got a tank. You don't need hostages.

261
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,800
我需要
I do.

262
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,580
这是为了告诉你我是认真的
This is just to show you I'm serious.

263
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,630
我才不会给新家轰个大洞呢
Not to blast a hole in our new home.

264
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,280
你和你的人  日落之前离开这里
You and your people, you have till sundown to get out of here

265
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,710
否则他们就得死
or they die.

266
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,530
没必要这样吧
Doesn't have to go down this way.

267
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,220
我的人马和武器都比你多
I got more people, more firepower.

268
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,970
我们需要这座监狱
We need this prison.

269
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,490
就是这样
There it is.

270
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,400
跟以前无关  一切只关乎现在
It's not about the past. It's about right now.

271
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,930
这里有孩子
There are children here.

272
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,850
有的病了  在外面他们活不下去
Some of them are sick. They won't survive.

273
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,980
我有辆坦克
I have a tank.

274
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,000
却让你们安全地离开这里
And I'm letting you walk away from here.

275
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,090
还有什么好废话的
What else is there to talk about?

276
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,920
你还好吗
You good?

277
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,480
还好
Yeah.

278
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,380
拿着
All right.

279
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,030
妈妈
Mommy,

280
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,260
你能帮我挖吗
can you please help me dig?

281
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,910
妈妈  能帮我吗
Mommy, can you please help me?

282
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,570
我马上过去  亲爱的
I'll be right there, honey.

283
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,420
妈妈  太沉了
Mommy, it's too heavy.

284
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,540
我听到了
I hear you.

285
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,630
我马上过去
I'll be there in a sec.

286
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,170
很抱歉  亲爱的  你刚说什么
I'm sorry, honey. What did you say?

287
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,780
没关系  我自己能行
It's okay. I can do it myself.

288
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,800
警告
山洪多发地段

289
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,290
梅根
Megan!

290
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,170
妈妈  妈妈
Mommy! Mommy!

291
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,490
妈妈
Mommy!

292
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,940
梅根
Megan!

293
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,340
梅根
Megan!

294
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,040
我可以向你们开火
I could shoot you all.

295
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,930
你们会反击  我知道
You'd all shoot back. I know that.

296
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,680
但最终我们会赢  你们会死的
But we'll win and you'll be dead.

297
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,860
全都会死
All of you.

298
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,590
没必要那样
Doesn't have to be like that.

299
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,750
如我先前说的  由你选择
Like I said, it's your choice.

300
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,700
动静太大只会吸引更多行尸
Noise will only draw more of them over.

301
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,310
你等得越久
The longer you wait,

302
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,380
你们就越难以离开这里
the harder it will be for you to get out of here.

303
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,760
我们得做点什么
We got to do something.

304
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,470
你爸爸能处理
Your dad's got it.

305
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,890
他们只顾着说话
They're talking.

306
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,540
我们现在就可以杀了总督
We could kill the Governor right now.

307
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,010
-隔着45米远吗  -我枪法很好
- From 50 yards? - I'm a good shot.

308
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,360
我现在就可以结束这一切
I could end this right now.

309
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,910
是啊  或者失手了挑起战斗
Yeah, or you could start something else.

310
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,120
你要信任他
You got to trust him.

311
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,710
你们要去哪
Where are you guys going?

312
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,380
-去大巴上  走吧  -不行
- To the bus. Come on. - No.

313
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,930
这是计划  我们应该去大巴上
You know the plan. That's where we're supposed to go.

314
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,970
卡萝尔告诉我们要坚强
Carol told us to be strong.

315
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,160
保护自己  他们有枪
To protect ourselves. They have guns.

316
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,920
我们也应该有枪
We should have guns, too.

317
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,460
我们应该去帮忙
We should help.

318
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,920
太阳下山前  你们大概还有一个小时
You got maybe about an hour of sunlight left.

319
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,720
我建议你们开始打包
I suggest you start packing.

320
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,050
拖得时间越久
The longer you wait,

321
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,780
越难从这里安全离开
the harder it's gonna be for you to get out of here.

322
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,730
我们可以
We can all--

323
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,360
我们可以一块住
we can all live together.

324
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,020
房间足够全部人住进去了
There's enough room for all of us.

325
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,940
地方是很充裕
More than enough.

326
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,360
但我的家人跟你们住在同一屋檐下
But I don't think my family would sleep well knowing

327
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,440
是睡不了安稳觉的
that you were under the same roof.

328
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,590
我们可以住在不同的牢房区
We'd live in different cell blocks.

329
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,950
在我们能接受对方之前
We'd never have to see each other

330
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,490
我们不用见面
till we're all ready.

331
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,550
这方法可行
It could work.

332
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,960
你知道的
You know it could.

333
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,590
是有可能
It could've.

334
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,020
但是不能这样
But it can't.

335
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,580
经历了伍德伯里
Not after Woodbury.

336
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,170
和安德莉亚的事情之后  不能这样
Not after Andrea.

337
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,780
我并没有说  这可以轻松实现
Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

338
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,320
事实上  这比我们站在这里互相开枪
Fact is, it's gonna be a hell of a lot harder

339
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,400
要难上一万倍
than standing here shooting at each other.

340
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,180
但我们没有其它选择
But I don't think we have a choice.

341
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,610
我们没有  你们有
We don't. You do.

342
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
我们不会离开的
We're not leaving.

343
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,080
如果你想逼我们离开  我们会拼死抵抗
You try and force us, we'll fight back.

344
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,050
就像你刚才说过的
Like you said,

345
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
枪声会引来更多行尸
the gunshots will just bring more of them out.

346
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,530
它们会挤倒围栏
They'll take down the fences.

347
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,570
没有了围栏  这个地方就毫无价值了
Without the fences, this place is worthless.

348
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,320
我们要不然就一起住在监狱
Now, we can all live in the prison

349
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,070
要不然就谁都住不了
or none of us can.

350
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,630
我们会修好那个该死的围栏的
We'll fix the damn fences.

351
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,760
不要
No--!

352
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,720
你  梳马尾辫的那个姑娘
You. You in the ponytails.

353
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,130
这是你想要的吗  这是你们想要的吗
Is this what you want? Is this what any of you want?

354
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,480
我们想要的就是你们的监狱
What we want is what you got.

355
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,350
就是这样
Period.

356
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,250
你们该滚蛋了  混蛋
Time for you to leave, asshole.

357
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,420
听着  我以前和他打过
Look, I fought him before.

358
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,920
之后  我们收留了他以前的同伴
And after, we took in his old friends.

359
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,370
他们成了我们这里的领导者
They've become leaders in what we have here.

360
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,440
如果你们现在放下武器
Now you put down your weapons,

361
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,660
从那些门进来
walk through those gates...

362
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,260
你们就是我们的一员
you're one of us.

363
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,680
我们既往不咎
We let go of all of it,

364
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,570
没人会伤亡
and nobody dies.

365
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,980
所有现在活着的人
Everyone who's alive right now.

366
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,200
所有坚持到现在的人
Everyone who's made it this far.

367
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,130
为了活下去  我们都不择手段过
We've all done the worst kinds of things just to stay alive.

368
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,440
但是我们依旧可以回头
But we can still come back.

369
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,250
我们还没有走得太远
We're not too far gone.

370
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,770
我们还可以回头
We get to come back.

371
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,940
我知道
I know...

372
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,290
我们都是可以改变的
we all can change.

373
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,350
骗子
Liar.

374
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,780
不要
No!

375
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,490
爸
Dad!

376
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,980
爸爸
Daddy!

377
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,960
你
You!

378
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,250
举起枪  快战斗
Pick up your weapon! Fight, now!

379
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,770
这不对
This isn't right.

380
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,530
-我们不该这样做  -必须这么做
- We're not supposed to be doing this. - We are.

381
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,440
他竟然用刀砍下了那人的头
He chopped a guy's head off with a sword.

382
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,070
我们必须留下  已经太晚了
We have to stay here. It's too late.

383
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,600
你明白吗
You understand me?

384
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,060
跟在我后面  如果我们走散了
Stay behind me and if we get separated,

385
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,120
你就找一个安全的地方躲起来
you just go run somewhere safe and hide.

386
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,260
听见了吗  找个安全的地方躲起来
You hear me? You go someplace safe and hide

387
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,910
等这一切结束后  我会去找你
and I will find you when this is all over. I will find you.

388
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,400
开车进围栏
Go through the fence in your cars.

389
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,600
拿上枪  我们进去
Get your guns, we go in.

390
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,900
杀光他们
Kill them all.

391
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,110
遵命  前进
Roger that. Move in!

392
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,860
前进
Go ahead!

393
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,100
我没弹药了
I'm out of ammo.

394
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,130
跑去大巴那边  我掩护你
Run for the bus. I'll cover you.

395
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,850
上去
Move up!

396
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,090
快跑  离开这里
Go! Get out of here!

397
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,340
快跑  格伦还在里面  我得去接他
Go, go! Come on! Glenn's in there. I have to get him.

398
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,820
-我跟你一起  -不  你去让人们上大巴
- I'm going with you. - No, get these people on the bus.

399
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,080
-随时准备出发  我马上回来  -如果你回不来呢
- Be ready to drive. I'll be right back. - What if you're not?

400
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,970
-那就丢下我先走  -我不能丢下你
- You have to go without us. - I won't go without you.

401
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,190
贝丝  让大家上大巴  好吗
Beth, get these people on the bus, okay?

402
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,630
这是你的职责  我们要各司其职
It's your job. We've all got jobs to do.

403
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,890
-格伦  -发生了什么
- Glenn! - What the hell's going on?

404
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,900
我们得带大家离开这里
We have to get everybody out of here.

405
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,080
贝丝  贝丝在哪
Beth! Where's Beth?

406
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,390
-她去找你了  -她去了哪里
- She went to find you. - Where?

407
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,400
我们会找到她的  她会没事的
We'll find her. She'll be okay.

408
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,730
-别来  -什么  不行  你不能自己去
- No. - What? No, you're not going by yourself.

409
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,340
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

410
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,960
玛姬
Maggie...

411
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,150
右边
On your right.

412
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,810
手榴弹
Grenade!

413
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,430
萨沙  萨沙  你看见贝丝了吗
