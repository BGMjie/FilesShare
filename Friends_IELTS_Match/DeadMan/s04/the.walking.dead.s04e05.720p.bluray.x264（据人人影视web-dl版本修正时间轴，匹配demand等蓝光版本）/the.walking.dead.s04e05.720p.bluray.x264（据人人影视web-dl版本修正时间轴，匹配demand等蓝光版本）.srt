1
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,930
亨利  冷静下来
Henry, I need you to calm down.

2
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,360
我们在帮你
We're trying to help.

3
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,290
不
No--!

4
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,710
你俩都喝点
Drink some of that. Both of you.

5
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,800
这场委员会会议真不赖
Some council meeting, huh?

6
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,400
少了两个人
We're two members short.

7
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,210
我们应该在他们归来之前制定新规矩
I think we should make some new rules before they get back.

8
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,590
我特此宣布  每周三的周二
I hereby declare we have spaghetti Tuesdays

9
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,210
我们都吃意式细面
every Wednesday.

10
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,960
首先我们得找到意式细面
First we have to find some spaghetti.

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,540
交给你没问题吗
You okay to take over?

12
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,400
每五到六秒挤一次
Every five to six seconds, squeeze.

13
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
当你觉得头晕时
You start feeling lightheaded,

14
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,420
就叫别人来接替你
grab somebody else to take over.

15
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,870
我们轮流来做
We'll take it in shifts.

16
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,020
你想帮我去巡查吗
You want to help me go on my rounds?

17
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,520
好
Yeah.

18
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,670
没问题
Sure.

19
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,850
那样能保住他多久的命
How long will that keep him alive?

20
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,710
只要我们愿意坚持  他就能活下去
Just as long as we're willing to do it.

21
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,570
不管需要多久
As long as it takes.

22
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,470
不  在这不行
No. Not here.

23
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,390
帮我把他抬上来
Help me get him on this.

24
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,150
好吧  但几小时后  亨利死了时...
Okay, but in a couple of hours when Henry's dead--

25
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,890
-格伦  -我们怎么能把他的尸体
- Glenn. - How are we gonna get his body

26
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,240
抬下楼  经过牢房区
down the stairs, across the cell block

27
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,070
经过一扇扇门  同时不让别人发现呢
and through those doors without anyone noticing?

28
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,790
如果发生了那种情况  你得帮我
If that happens-- if-- you're gonna help me.

29
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,690
如果我不在了呢
And what if I'm gone?

30
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,880
闭嘴  帮我把他抬上来
Shut up and help me get him on this.

31
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,110
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

32
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,400
我们把雅各布森先生送去更安静的地方
We're taking Mr. Jacobson to a quieter place.

33
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,670
去我的房里拿那本《汤姆・索耶历险记》吧
Go get my copy of "Tom Sawyer" from my room.

34
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,700
我想让你今晚看完
I want you to read it by tonight.

35
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,560
我们要各司其职
We all got jobs to do.

36
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,630
-那是你的任务  -我看不完的
- That one's yours. - I won't finish it.

37
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,050
为什么
Why?

38
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,850
会太黑的  看不见
It's gonna get too dark.

39
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,520
好吧
Well,

40
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,540
尽量试试
give it your best try.

41
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,710
再喝点茶
And drink some tea.

42
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,670
你以前还没这样做过吧
You haven't had to do this yet, have you?

43
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,750
昨晚深夜时有一个人去世了
There was one late last night.

44
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,220
是萨沙动手的
Sasha did it.

45
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,260
人们没必要看见
People don't need to see it.

46
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,780
我不想让他们看见
I don't want them to.

杀了凯伦和大卫
She killed Karen and David.

108

她是为了防止病毒扩散
She was trying to stop it from spreading.

109
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,930
泰尔西很快就回来了
Tyreese is gonna be back here soon,

110
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,850
所以她还是离开比较好
so I didn't think she should be here.

111
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,280
而且我也不能留她
And I couldn't have her here.

112
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,870
她有车有供给
She has a car, supplies,

113
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,610
应该没问题
she'll figure it out.

114
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,420
我等下告诉你父亲  先别告诉其他人
I'll tell your dad. Don't tell anyone else yet.

115
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,270
好
Okay.

116
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,430
换做是你  你会带她回来吗
Would you have brought her back?

117
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,400
-她承认是她干的吗  -是的
- She said she did it? - Yeah.

118
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,730
那你让她走就是对的
Then you were right to send her away.

119
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,980
不知道我能不能做到
I don't know if I could have.

120
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,740
你可以做到  玛姬
You could have, Maggie.

121
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,010
更难的事你都做了
You've done harder things.

122
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,790
别怀疑自己  我们没这特权了
Don't doubt yourself. We don't get to anymore.

123
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,070
瑞克  行尸越来越多了  比推倒栅栏的那群还多
Rick, the cluster's getting bigger than the one that took the fence down.

124
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,750
-我们得做点什么了  -我们会的
- We need to do something. - We will.

125
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,190
卡尔
Carl?

126
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,350
卡尔
Carl.

127
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,040
卡尔
Carl?

128
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,600
你还好吗
You okay?

129
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,610
我正想问你呢
I was gonna ask you that.

130
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,360
-我们很好  -没人生病吗
- We're fine. - No one's sick?

131
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,930
没有需要采取措施吧
You didn't have to do anything?

132
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,520
没遇到需要开枪的状况  爸
Haven't had to use my gun, Dad.

133
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,830
朱迪思呢
And Judith?

134
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,560
她跟贝丝在一起
She's with Beth.

135
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,820
很好
Good.

136
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,270
在外面找到了点食物
Found some food on the run.

137
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,440
这里有些水果干
There's a bunch of fruit leather in there.

138
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,820
吃完之后让大家把牙刷了
Have everybody brush their teeth after.

139
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,870
-我们能早点出去吗  -还不行
- Can we come out soon? - Not just yet.

140
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,390
爸  你暴露在病毒下的时候我在你身边  
Dad, I was around you when you were in the middle of it.

141
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,120
我也在帕特里克的身边
And I was around Patrick.

142
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,340
我没被传染  我能帮你
I didn't get it. I can help you.

143
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,220
谢了  但是我需要你待在这里
Thanks, but I need you to stay here.

144
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,930
我会的  但是
I will. But,

145
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,580
爸  你不能让我避开
Dad, you can't keep me from it.

146
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,450
避开什么
From what?

147
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,720
避开总要发生的事
From what always happens.

148
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,950
是啊
Yeah.

149
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,430
也许吧
Maybe.

150
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,490
但我觉得我有责任试试
But I think it's my job to try.

151
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,360
谢谢你
Thank you.

152
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,710
不客气
No problem.

153
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,920
让我看看你
Let's have a look at you.

154
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,490
医生是最差的病人
Doctors make the worst patients.

155
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,530
不是所有人都能活下去
Not everyone gets to live.

156
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,580
晚期就意味着病入膏肓
End stage is a point that no one comes back from

157
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,800
无法好转
or they-- or they can't.

158
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,370
我现在就是晚期
That's where I am.

159
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,820
不  你得把精力放到能活下去的人的身上
No, you need to focus on the ones that can make it.

160
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,360
我又做了一些点滴
I made some more IVs.

161
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,000
如果你不准备好失去一个人
If you're not ready to lose one,

162
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,710
你就会失去他们所有人
you're gonna lose them all.

163
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,260
这就像是关灯一样
It's like turning off a light--

164
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,710
一盏一盏地灭掉
it'll happen one after the other.

165
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,690
而且他们还不止是死了这么简单
And they don't just die.

166
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,110
我们能挺过去的
We can hold on.

167
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,800
迦勒
Caleb.

168
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,480
迦勒
Caleb.

169
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,310
那个牢房区出事后
After what happened in the other cell block,

170
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,250
当我来这里时  带来了这些
when I came in here, I brought these.

171
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,410
躺回床上去  我们的情况还没那么糟
Get back in bed now. We're not that bad off.

172
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,680
等真那么糟时
When we are,

173
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,900
就迟了
it'll be too late.

174
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,550
你不明白
You don't understand.

175
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,050
你还有生存机会
You have a chance.

176
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,510
但得了这病  我们已经死定了
This is it after this.

177
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,550
我不会放弃任何一个人
I'm not giving up on anyone.

178
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,150
至少目前不会
Not yet.

179
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,670
一定保证每个人的门都关好了
Just make sure everyone's doors are shut.

180
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,990
迦勒
Caleb...

181
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,840
一定要保证
Just make sure!

182
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,920
迦勒  你得让我看看
Caleb, you've got to let me look at you.

183
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,380
好吧  赫谢尔
Okay, Hershel.

184
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,690
尽管看吧
Have a look.

185
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,470
喝了我给你的茶
Drink the tea I left you.

186
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,880
我一小时之后回来看你
Gonna be back to check on you in an hour.

187
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,220
大家
Everyone,

188
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,570
回到你们的牢房里
get back in your cells.

189
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,990
快点  回你们的牢房里去
Go on, get back in your cells.

190
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,160
我们把他搬上来吧
Let's get him on this.

191
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,650
去休息吧
Go rest.

192
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,330
你能自己走回你的牢房吗
Can you make it to your cell?

193
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,420
? Go your way ?

194
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,150
? I'll take the long way around ?

195
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,990
? I'll find my own way down ?

196
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,290
? As I should ?

197
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,580
? And hold your gates ?

198
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,910
? There's coke in the Midas touch ?

199
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,420
? A joke in the way that we rust ?

200
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,560
? And breathe again... ?

201
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,670
赫谢尔
Hershel.

202
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,320
这是我们失去的第三个人了
Third one we've lost.

203
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,930
我们在牢区后面火化了他们
We're burning them behind the blocks.

204
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,370
火化了他们
Burning them.

205
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,390
只能这样了
That's what it's come to.

206
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,390
你还好吧
Are you okay?

207
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,720
我昨天还和他聊了斯坦贝克[小说家]
I talked to him yesterday about Steinbeck.

208
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,550
他给我引用了一句话
He told me a quote.

209
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,150
"一个悲伤的灵魂
"A sad soul

210
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,390
比细菌让你死的更快"
can kill quicker than a germ."

211
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,910
所以我不想让他们看见发生了什么
That's exactly why I didn't want them all to see what happens.

212
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,080
我知道他们知道
I know they know,

213
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,330
但我不想让他们看见这一幕
but I didn't want them to see it right now.

214
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,260
他们是在看着你呢  赫谢尔
They're seeing you, Hershel.

215
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,040
他们看到你
They see you

216
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,080
坚持不渝
keep going.

217
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,420
即使选择越来越少
Even after all the choices keep getting taken away.

218
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,300
等我们挺过去
When we get past this thing...

219
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,870
事情不会再像之前那样  对吗
it's not gonna be like how it was, is it?

220
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,850
不会
No.

221
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,850
那算是逃避吗
Was that denial?

222
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,700
对事实视而不见
Not seeing things for how they were?

223
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,010
不
No.

224
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,770
你只是需要缓缓
You just caught a break.

225
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,450
你需要点时间  休息了一下
You needed some time. You got some.

226
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,660
你运气好
You got lucky.

227
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,550
我们都是
We all did.

228
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,150
我还是认为这是上天的安排
I still think there's a plan.

229
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,690
我还是相信这一切事出有因
I still believe there's a reason.

230
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,320
你认为这都是考验吗
You think it's all a test?

231
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,170
生活永远都是考验  瑞克
Life was always a test, Rick.

232
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,390
我得跟你说说卡萝尔的事
I need to talk to you about Carol.

233
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,660
挺住
Come on.

234
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,390
挺住  萨沙
Come on, Sasha.

235
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,530
你知道怎么战斗
You know how to fight.

236
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,930
坚持住
Just hold on.

237
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,880
坚持住  别放弃
Just hold on. Don't give up on me, now.

238
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,690
我刚跟你爸谈过了
I just talked to your dad.

239
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,220
总体来说  他看着还行
He looks good, all things considered.

240
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,940
如果卡尔病了  你会在那儿陪着他吗
If Carl were sick, would you be up there with him?

241
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,020
如果我觉得自己能帮上忙的话
If I thought I could help.

242
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,710
你觉得我帮不上忙吗
You don't think I can help?

243
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,600
该死
Damn.

244
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,630
我很庆幸你和我一起在外面
I'm just glad you're out here with me.

245
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,540
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

246
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,060
我昏过去了吗
I passed out?

247
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,760
你脱水了
You were dehydrated.

248
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,050
逞英雄消耗太大了吧
Being a hero takes a lot out of you.

249
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,170
你明白的
You should know.

250
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,020
我觉得你进这里太蠢了
I thought you were an idiot to come in here.

251
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,210
我以为你必死无疑
I mean, I was sure you were just gonna be a dead foolish man.

252
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,270
我不知道这算不算恭维
I can't tell if that's a compliment.

253
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,550
我不知道我在说什么
I don't know what I'm saying.

254
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,180
我一定是撞到头了
I must have hit my head.

255
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,450
我不相信魔法
I don't believe in magic

256
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,550
或是运气
or luck.

257
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,160
我精心计算
I do the math

258
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,350
从不赌运气
and I don't gamble.

259
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,610
但如果不是你那么蠢
But I don't know if I'd be here right now

260
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,500
我恐怕也活不下来
if you weren't so damn stupid.

261
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,420
你知道吗
You know what?

262
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,070
我就当你是在恭维了
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

263
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,570
赫谢...
Hersh--

264
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,630
赫谢尔
Hershel--

265
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,610
我过一会儿再来看你
I'll check on you in a little while.

266
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,810
他怎么样
How is he?

267
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,790
在睡觉
He's sleeping.

268
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,080
你自己也该休息会儿
