00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,450
-你放哨  -你才应该放哨

你站都站不稳
You can barely stand.

进吧
Let's go.

-我可以从这里打死它  -不

我说了别开枪
I said not to.

47
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,080
你没法用斧子杀死它
You couldn't do it with the ax.

48
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,210
我能干掉它
I had it.

49
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,210
每颗子弹都很重要
Every bullet counts.

50
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,900
如果你回头需要那颗子弹呢
What if you needed that one later?

51
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,600
看看能找到什么  然后我们就走

如果有行尸  早就出来了
If there's one of them down there, they would have come out.

64
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,910
我把门系死了
I tied the door shut.

65
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,260
我们不能冒险
We don't need to take any chances.

66
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,660
你觉得不够牢吗
You don't think it'll hold?

67
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,960
-卡尔  -这个结很结实
- Carl. - It's a strong knot.

68
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,150
双套结  肖恩教我的
Clove hitch. Shane taught me.

69
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,330
记得他吗
Remember him?

70
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,040
是的  我记得他

我每天都会记起他
I remember him every day.

72
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,710
你还有什么话想对我说吗
There something else you want to say to me?

73
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,540
撑过今晚应该没问题
This'll have to do for the night.

74
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,960
你想来点吗
You gonna have some?

75
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,520
你应该吃点东西
You should eat.

76
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,920
我们应该存着
We should save it.

77
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,860
我不想吃
I don't want any.

78
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,540
赶紧吃了
Eat it.

79
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,210
现在就吃
Now.

80
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,070
听着  我只是实话实说
Listen. I'm just being honest.

81
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,760
我觉得有点平淡
I thought it was a bit... pedestrian.

82
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,680
-平淡  -也就是说无趣
- Pedestrian? - As in lame.

83
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,360
-而且俗套  -俗套吗
- And played. - Played?

84
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,610
你之前在哪里见过  说说看
Where have you seen anything like it before? Tell me that.

85
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,440
我从没见过一只大猩猩开车
I've never seen a gorilla drive a car before,

86
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,810
但即使你将其陈列于博物馆中
but if you put it in a museum,

87
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,300
我也不觉得那是艺术
I'm not gonna call it art.

88
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,930
麦克  你能跟你家亲爱的讲讲道理吗
Mike, would you please talk some sense into your lover?

89
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,100
上帝啊  别那样称呼我
Oh, my God. You did not just call me that.

90
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,820
我同意我家亲爱的观点
I agree with my lover.

91
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,310
-我也觉得这...  -非常无趣
- I mean, the whole thing was-- - Very lame.

92
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,520
-而且非常俗套  -等等  等等
- And very played. - Oh, wait, wait, wait.

93
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,170
不不不  别这样  不要这样
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that.

94
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,560
你俩这样一唱一和
Don't start finishing each other's sentences, man.

95
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,890
特恶心
This is just gross.

96
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,480
我想说的是  整体感觉就像
I was going to say that the whole thing was like a monument to

97
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,870
某人竭尽全力想标新立异
someone trying too damned hard to be different.

98
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,500
哈利路亚
Hallelujah.

99
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,960
听着  我很高兴自己看了
Listen, I'm glad I saw it

100
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,990
虽然我并不喜欢
even though I did not love it.

101
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,060
希望我们没有烦到你  小可爱
Hope we're not boring you, peanut.

102
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,210
快过来
Come here.

103
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,380
我们不能在营地久留
I don't think that we should stay at the camp.

104
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,330
不  我不会把儿子带出去
No. I'm not taking my son out there.

105
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,940
我不敢肯定这地方是否安全
I don't know if this place will work out,

106
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,450
但我敢肯定外面一定不安全
but I know it won't if we go out there.

107
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,140
这一切还有什么意义吗
Does it even matter anymore?

108
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,090
我们是在自欺欺人吗
Are we just kidding ourselves?

109
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,490
好吧
Okay.

110
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,830
我明白是怎么回事了
All right, I see what this is.

111
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,160
真的吗
Really?

112
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,060
