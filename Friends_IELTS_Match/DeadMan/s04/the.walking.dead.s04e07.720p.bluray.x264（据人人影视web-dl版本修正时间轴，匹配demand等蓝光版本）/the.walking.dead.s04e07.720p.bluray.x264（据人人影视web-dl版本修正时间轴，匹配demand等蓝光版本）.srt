1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,760
该你走了  小姑娘
Your move, pumpkin.

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,590
我在思考
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,300
米奇  拿着
Mitch, grab that.

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,540
上去吧
Go on.

5
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,650
你不能一直思考
You can't think forever.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
迟早得出手
Sooner or later, you've got to make a move.

7
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,830
反正你也从不让我赢
You never let me win anyway.

8
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,300
让了就不算赢了
Well, that wouldn't be winning.

9
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,580
我爸爸以前常这么说
That's what my daddy used to say.

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,020
他也经常下棋赢我
He used to beat me at chess, too.

11
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,650
他什么都比我好[双关]
Heck, he used to beat me at everything.

12
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,340
你认识这个人吗
You know this guy?

13
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,400
你爸爸刻薄吗
Was your dad mean?

14
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,640
有时候吧
Sometimes.

15
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,190
你坏吗
Were you bad?

16
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,180
有时候吧
Sometimes.

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,410
你一直在路上漂泊吗
So you've been on the road all this time?

18
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,590
对
Yeah.

19
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,750
你没事吧  布莱恩
You okay, Brian?

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,760
怎么了  小姑娘
What is it, pumpkin?

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,510
我坏吗
Am I bad?

22
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,020
什么
What?

23
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,390
你为什么会这样想
Why would you think that?

24
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,360
我爸爸总是对我很刻薄
My dad was always mean to me.

25
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,290
你很好
Hey, you're good.

26
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,270
真的
You are.

27
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,770
我们的营地离这里半英里
We've got a camp about a half a mile from here.

28
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,830
绝对不行  马丁内斯
Hell, no, Martinez.

29
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,070
我们那边人已经够多了
We got too many mouths as it is.

30
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,250
看在老天的份上  他们带着个小孩
They got a kid for Christ's sake.

31
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,890
如果你跟我们回去
Hey, if you do come back with us,

32
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,510
就得接受两件事
there's two things you got to accept.

33
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,820
第一  我掌权
One, I'm in charge.

34
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,190
第二  不许成为累赘
Two, no deadweight.

35
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,250
大家都得遵守
That goes for everyone.

36
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,820
要么做出贡献  要么就被赶走
Contribute or be cast out.

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,610
你能接受吗
Can you live with that,

38
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,140
布莱恩
Brian?

39
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,530
你我  你妈妈  还有塔拉姨妈
You, me, your mom, and Aunt Tara,

40
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,910
我们都会没事的
we're gonna be okay.

41
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,830
因为我们是好人吗
'Cause we're good?

42
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,090
我们都是吗
All of us?

43
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,220
该你了
Your turn.

44
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,780
布莱恩
Brian?

45
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,800
该你了
It's your turn.

46
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,670

你今天出去吗
You going out there today?

56
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,010
去找补给品
Supply run.

57
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,620
马丁内斯和杜尔根兄弟
Martinez and the Dolgen brothers.

58
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,250
我要在营地建立一个护士站
I'm gonna set up a nurses' station for the camp.

59
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,430
他们有这个需要
They need one.

60
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,280
-抱歉  莉莉  这地方...  -别说了
- I'm sorry, Lily. This place is-- - Stop it.

61
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,090
我想为我们找到更好的地方
I wanted something better for us.

62
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,570
这个营地不错了
This camp is good.

63
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,050
我们会让这里变得更好
We'll make it better.

64
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,930
有鱼吗
How's the fishing?

65
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,800
没鱼了  池塘水质不好
There isn't any. Pond's dead.

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,740
这是一潭死水
As a doornail.

67
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,600
但我们还可以抓点兔子  臭鼬
We still got rabbits, skunks,

68
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,150
负鼠什么的来吃
some possum out here.

69
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,590
你还是管好你自己吧  独眼老布
You better watch your ass, One Eye Bri.

70
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,050
你确定我们走对方向了吗
You sure we're headed in the right direction?

71
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,870
照着霍华德的地图走的
If Howard's map is right.

72
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,410
真应该把他拖出来问个清楚
We should have dragged his ass out here to make sure.

73
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,350
人家老年人  哪里走得动
He's an old man. He can barely walk.

74
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,970
所以我才说拖着他走
That's why I said dragged.

75
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,090
希望这趟没白跑
Hope this is worth it.

76
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,550
也许他是那种末日生存主义者
Supposedly this guy was a survivalist type.

77
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,710
他的小屋里或许能找出有用的东西
His cabin might have stuff we can use.

78
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,530
说不定他还活着
Hell, maybe he's still alive.

79
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,440
我觉得危险
I won't keep my fingers crossed.

80
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,880
嘿  独眼龙  你在干嘛
Hey, One Eye. What you doing?

81
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,210
这是什么
The hell is this?

82
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,270
骗子

83
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,480
看来他把某人惹毛了
Somebody pissed somebody off.

84
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,630
管他呢
Who gives a shit?

85
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
死了一了百了
That guy's got nothing to worry about anymore.

86
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,610
继续走
Let's go.

87
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,190
-这个伤口很深  -没事
- It's a deep cut. - No, that's nothing, ma'am.

88
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,970
不过是玩刀子玩过头了  很快就好了
I just got cute with my knife, that's all. I'll be fine.

89
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,210
那么...
So...

90
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,560
我叫艾丽西娅
Alicia.

91
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,610
哦对  艾丽西娅
Alicia. Right.

92
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,940
你是海军陆战队的吗
You in the Marines or something?

93
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,170
我是陆军预备役
Army. In the reserves.

94
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,470
用的M4步枪对吧
An M4, huh?

95
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,210
你有意见吗
You don't approve?

96
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,770
别误会
I mean, don't get me wrong,

97
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,500
用M4步枪打近战不错
an M4 is great for close combat,

98
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,970
但作为野战武器的话
but as a field weapon?

99
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,800
尘土飞扬易卡壳  还是算了吧
With all that dirt and dust, no, thanks.

100
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,160
我不太喜欢长枪
I've never really been into big guns anyway.

101
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,140
我更喜欢史密斯威森手枪
I'm more of a Smith & Wesson gal.

102
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,880
方便又好用
Less fuss, you know?

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,630
你尽喜欢装逼对吧
You always this full of shit?

104
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,050
没错
Yes, I am

105
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,880
强奸犯

106
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,660
凶手

107
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,230
自杀了
Took himself out.

108
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,000
你觉得是他杀了那些军人吗
You think he's the one who 86'd those military guys?

109
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,070
-他的头还在  -没剩多少了
- He still has his head. - Some of it, anyway.

110
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,200
进屋看看
Let's see what he's got inside.

111
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,090
听到了吗  里面有行尸
You hear that? There's one in there.

112
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,010
肯定被卡住了出不来
Must be stuck if it ain't coming out.

113
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,530
要进去吗
We going in?

114
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,550
你吓尿了吗  磨蹭什么
You want us to wait till you finish pissing in your pants?

115
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,860
-不  我只是  -别废话了
- No, I'm... - Cut the chatter.

116
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:02,920
进去吧
Let's go.

117
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,820
-很近了  -安静
- It's close. - Quiet.

118
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,070
-它出来了  -闭嘴
- It's out. - Shut up.

119
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:39,890
赶走它
Get it off of me!

120
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,960
把它弄下来
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

121
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,030
快把它弄下来
Get it off of me!

122
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,570
皮特
Pete!

123
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,840
假如当时坑里只有你一人
If it was just you in that pit,

124
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,140
我是不会把你带进营地的
I wouldn't have brought you into the camp.

125
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,460
要不是那些和你在一起的人
If it weren't for the people you were with...

126
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,610
那个小女孩儿...
the girl...

127
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,250
你感觉不太一样了
You seem different now.

128
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,310
变了
Changed.

129
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,880
是不是
Are you?

130
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,920
是的
I am.

131
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,700
那就好
Good.

132
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,180
这人有堆好东西
The guy had some good stuff.

133
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,460
罐头
Canned food.

134
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,020
我们有啤酒喝了
We got beer.

135
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,550
天呐  这儿发生什么了
Man, what happened here?

136
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,080
这间小屋里到底发生了什么
I mean, what the hell was going on in this cabin?

137
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,000
他养着那些行尸吗
Was he storing those biters?

138
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,830
她们是他的妻子和小孩
They were his wife and kid, man.

139
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,780
不  它们是行尸
No, they were biters.

140
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,670
那些头又是怎么回事
What about those heads?

141
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,040
那些头的主人惹错了对象
Belonged to the guys who did the wrong thing to the wrong man.

142
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,370
我们还是别细想这事了
Probably best not to think too much about it.

143
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,900
你最好听独眼老布的话  皮特
Better listen to One Eye Bri, Pete.

144
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,350
我永远也分不清他是在使眼色还是在眨眼
I can never tell if he's winking or blinking.

145
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,030
但你知道如何控制的  是吧  老布
But you know how to regulate, don't you, Bri?

146
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,920
他一直是这样吗  马丁内斯
He was always like this, Martinez?

147
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,050
是啊  喜怒不形于色
Oh, yeah. Ice in the veins.

148
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,830
你应该看看他当年风光的样子
You should have seen him back in the day.

149
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,830
你们大伙儿呢
What about you fellas, huh?

150
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,030
在这巨变发生前你是做什么的
What did you do before it all changed?

151
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,590
我是
I was...

152
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,450
我是个冰淇淋车司机
I was an ice cream truck driver.

153
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,810
之后我鸟枪换炮
Till I upgraded my life

154
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,740
成为了一个坦克驾驶员
and I became a tank operator

155
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,550
为美国陆军服务
for the US Army.

156
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,710
当一切变糟之后
Then when everything went tits up,

157
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,300
我离开了军队  开走了坦克
I got the hell out and took my ride with me.

158
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,470
假如你有一辆坦克的话
End of the world don't mean shit

159
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,660
世界末日就不算什么屁事了
when you got a tank.

160
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,650
我也是陆军
I was Army, too.

161
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,000
驻扎在本宁堡
Stationed out of Fort Benning.

162
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,570
灾难降临后我还在那待了一阵子
Stayed for a while after it all started.

163
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,310
这就是我家皮特
That's my Pete.

164
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,950
他太忠心了  不愿离开
He's too loyal to bounce.

165
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,180
你呢  布莱恩
What about you, Brian?

166
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,000
当时你在做什么
What did you do when it all went bad?

167
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,680
生存
I survived.

168
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,920
等等  你父亲是天主教神父
Wait, your father was a Catholic priest?

169
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,760
没错
That's right.

170
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,950
所以神父当了爹吗
So the father became a daddy?

171
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,380
的确给教堂带来了一些麻烦
It caused some problems with the Church a little bit.

172
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,580
这些故事布莱恩以前都听过
This is all stuff Brian's heard before.

173
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,920
我们在一起待过很长时间
We spent a lot of time out there together.

174
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,140
你们在这里做得很好  我是说这个营地
You've done all right here. I mean this camp.

175
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,580
这是一切发生之后我第一次有安全感
It's the first time I've felt safe since all this started.

176
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,220
我跟布莱恩之前待的地方挺不错
The place Brian and I lived before kind of worked.

177
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,600
我想让这里也一样
I guess I wanted that again.

178
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,680
听起来你们的旧营地非常好
Sounds like your old camp was pretty sweet.

179
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,240
你们有围墙  对吗
You guys had walls, right?

180
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,680
没错  那是
Yeah. Yeah, it was...

181
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,670
那是个好地方
it was a good place.

182
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,240
这里也是个好地方  对吗
This place is good, too, right?

183
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,210
你知道的
You know it.

184
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,420
希望有一天我能听听详情
I want to hear all about it someday.

185
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,940
布莱恩一个字都不肯说
Brian won't say a word.

186
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,120
过去的事就让它过去吧
I say leave the past in the past.

187
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,900
好吧  很久以来第一次
Well, for the first time in a long time,

188
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,580
-我醉成一坨屎了  -塔拉
- I'm shitfaced. - Tara.

189
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,970
抱歉  梅根  别说那个词  好吗
Sorry. Megan, don't say that, okay?

190
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,800
-你想走了吗  -好
- You want to get out of here? - Yeah.

191
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,830
谢谢款待  尤其谢谢你们的啤酒
Thanks for the dinner. Double thanks for the suds.

192
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,830
好  再见
Yeah. Boom. There you go.

193
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,970
-注意安全  -好
- Be safe. - Yep.

194
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,210
我想我也该走了
I think, um-- I think I'm gonna go.

195
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,560
你确定吗  我还有不少臭啤酒呢
You sure? I got a couple of skunky beers left.

196
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,140
我没事  谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

197
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,770
布莱恩  屋顶又漏了
Brian, the roof's leaking again.

198
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,790
你去修修吧  伙计
You should fix that, man.

199
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,740
我会的
I'll do that.

200
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,870
回见  小娃娃
Later, muneca.

201
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,220
差点忘了  有个惊喜给你
Almost forgot. Got a surprise for you.

202
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,820
我靠
Aw, damn it.

203
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,870
再给我递一个
Hand me another one.

204
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,450
你知道他死了  对吗
You know he's dead, right?

205
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,050
香珀特
Shumpert?

206
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,020
伍德伯里之后他就不一样了
He was never the same after Woodbury.

207
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,830
他变得不顾死活
Yeah. He got reckless.

208
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,480
行尸在那边咬掉了他一块肉
Biter took a piece of him right over there.

209
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,520
我发誓  他都没想要躲开
I swear, he didn't try to get out of the way.

210
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,540
我亲手杀了他
I put him down myself.

211
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,260
就在那边
Right over there.

212
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,160
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,230
有些事情你永远无法回头
There's some things you just can't come back from.

214
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,630
它们变成了你的一部分
They become a part of who you are.

215
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,330
不管你是否能够接受
Either you live with them or you don't.

216
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,760
看起来你接受的挺好
Well, you seem to be living with them pretty well.

217
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,040
你也一样
So are you.

218
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,400
那家人真是让你变了
That family, they brought you back.

219
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,080
你很幸运  我不能
You're lucky. I couldn't--

220
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,610
我不能再那么做了  不能冒那个险
I couldn't do that again. Couldn't risk it.

221
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,120
想到可能失去她们  我就无法安眠
Couldn't sleep at night knowing I was gonna lose them.

222
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,420
我不会失去她们的
I'm not gonna lose them.

223
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,180
是啊
Yeah.

224
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,540
你不认为你能保护营地的安全吗
What, you don't think you can keep this place safe?

225
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,340
我会尽力
I'll try.

226
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,000
希望我们能尽量做好准备
Hopefully we'll be prepared for whatever comes.

227
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,490
现在你来了
Now you're here,

228
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,260
也许我们可以分享权力
maybe we can share the crown a little.

229
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,200
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

230
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,100
早知道我就学学高尔夫了
I should have taken some golf lessons before the-

231
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,200
我不想这么做
I don't wanna do it!

232
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,460
我不想  我不想
I don't want it! I don't want it!

233
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,110
听见了吗  我也不想  该死的
You hear me? I don't want it, damn it!

234
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,520
我不想这么做
I don't want it.

235
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,810
我不想这么做
I don't want it.

236
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,630
布莱恩  我们回来了
Brian, we're home!

237
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,660
梅根  他睡觉呢
Megan, he's sleeping.

238
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,310
布莱恩
Brian?

239
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,560
你在发抖
You're shaking.

240
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,190
怎么了
What is it?

241
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,050
做了个噩梦  没什么
I just had a bad dream, that's all.

242
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,600
什么样的噩梦
What was it?

243
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,820
我不记得了
I can't remember.

244
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,140
大家听着
Listen up!

245
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,300
今天早上  我们在坑里
We found what was left of Martinez

246
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,510
找到了马丁内斯的残骸
in a pit this morning.

247
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,270
貌似他当时在打高尔夫
Looks like he was hitting some golf balls,

248
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,820
他喝多了
he got drunk,

249
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,210
然后掉进了坑里
he fell in.

250
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,360
那现在怎么办
So now what?

251
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,220
我将接管营地
I'm taking leadership of the camp.

252
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,330
-不  不  -等一下  都等等
- No. No. - Hold on now. Hold on now!

253
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,520
我们应该投票才对
We should vote on who leads, right?

254
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,280
-是啊  -你没权利就这么接任
- Yeah. - You can't just take over.

255
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,740
-闭嘴  婊子  -你说什么
- Shut your mouth, you little bitch. - What?

256
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,040
冷静
Hey, calm down!

257
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,940
大家都冷静
Calm down, all of you.

258
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,530
我们现在
We need each other

259
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,440
更需要团结一致
now more than ever.

260
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,080
能熬过这一切的唯一办法
The only way we get through this, through any of this,

261
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,370
就是团结一致
is together.

262
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,390
现在的安排是暂时的
Now this is temporary.

263
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,950
未来几天内我们会想办法选举
We'll find some kind of way to do a vote in the next couple of days.

264
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,270
但现在  一切照旧
For now, it's business as usual.

265
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,620
行吗
Okay?

266
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,700
你们听见他说的了
You heard the man.

267
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,780
解散
Move!

268
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,800
拜托了
Please?

269
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,010
做好准备  我们去找补给
Gear up. We're going on a hunt.

270
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,550
定量配给  修护栏  药品储备
Rationing, fences, medical supplies.

271
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,460
有无数个问题而人们期望我给出答案
There are 100 questions and people are looking to me for answers.

272
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,370
当领袖是很难
Well, it's hard to lead.

273
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,660
是啊  我需要点协助
Yeah, I could use some help.

274
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,040
有多少人
How many?

275
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,400
10个
10.

276
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,660
可能不到
Maybe less.

277
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,590
但他们供给很足
They got a lot of supplies, though.

278
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,400
也许我们该把他们吸收进来
Maybe we should take 'em in.

279
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,600
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

280
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,520
我们的供给只是勉强够分
We barely got enough to go around as it is.

281
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,270
听着  皮特  我知道你不想伤害任何人
Look, Pete, I know you don't want to hurt nobody.

282
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,960
我也不想  但我们需要那些供给
Neither do I, but we need those supplies.

283
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,700
我们直接过去
Now let's just go over there

284
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,050
拿到需要的东西  就回家
and take what we need and go home.

285
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,150
不采取暴力
No rough stuff.

286
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,250
-你想抢劫他们  -何不呢
- You want to rob 'em? - Why not?

287
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,860
我们需要他们的补给
We need their stuff.

288
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,600
-他们有枪  但如果我们动作快点  -不
- They got guns, but if we roll up on 'em quick--  - No.

289
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,000
不行  我们自己也能找到供给
No, we can find our own supplies.

290
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,120
走吧 
Come on.

291
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,260
太搞笑了
What a joke.

292
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,440
我们干得挺好的
We did all right.

293
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,530
是啊  几只该死的松鼠  几罐炼乳
Yeah, a couple of damn squirrels, some condensed milk.

294
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,790
你还要我怎么样  我在努力呢
What do you want from me? I'm trying here.

295
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,330
你去哪儿
Where you going?

296
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,560
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

297
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,450
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

298
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,070
这不是行尸干的
This wasn't biters.

299
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,210
是人干的
People did this.

300
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,840
肯定是刚发生的
Must have just happened.

301
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,800
我们本来可以拿到供给的
We would have had those supplies.

302
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,990
死了这么多人
You're worried about supplies?

303
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,990
你还在担心供给  米奇
These people are dead, Mitch.

304
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,450
你说的太对了  他们死了
You're damn right they're dead!

305
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,350
反正他们都是个死
That was gonna happen either way.

306
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,780
现在倒让别人抢走了咱们的供给
Now some other group's got our stuff.

307
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,100
米奇  米奇  不
Mitch. Mitch, no!

308
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,980
他可能还活着
He might have lived.

309
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,020
可能吧
Might have.

310
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,800
需要这个吗
Need this?

311
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,630
布莱恩  出什么事了
Brian, what's going on?

312
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,550
-马上收拾你的东西  -怎么啦
- Pack your things, now. - What's happening?

313
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,520
等等  宝贝
Hold on, baby.

314
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,880
拿上你的衣服  带点吃的  快点
Grab your clothes, pack some food. Come on.

315
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,380
妈妈
Mommy?

316
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,550
-布莱恩  住手  -去找塔拉
- Brian, stop. - Get Tara.

317
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,800
我们得走了  这里不再安全了
We need to leave. It isn't safe here anymore.

318
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,980
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

319
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,200
我们不能就这么走人
We can't just run off.

320
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,370
我是营地里唯一的护士  
I'm the only nurse in camp.

321
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,430
塔拉跟艾丽西娅在一起
Tara's got Alicia.

322
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,920
那梅根怎么办
What about Megan?

323
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,340
听着  这里就要出大事了
Look, things are about to go very wrong here.

324
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,530
我以前遇到过  不能再让你和梅根遭罪
It's happened to me before. I can't put you and Megan through that.

325
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,080
不能再失去你们了
Can't lose you again.

326
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,840
那皮特怎么办
What about Pete?

327
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,490
你说过他是个好人
You said he was a good man.

328
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,310
-我错了  -但是...
- Well, I was wrong. - But...

329
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,950
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

330
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,450
你相信我吗  莉莉
Do you trust me, Lily?

331
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,550
那就快收拾东西
Then pack your things.

332
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,050
我们今晚就走
We're leaving tonight, okay?

333
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,480
快点
Come on.

334
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,720
妈妈
Mommy.

335
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,370
妈妈
Mommy.

336
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,810
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

337
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,990
-艾丽西娅  -你应该开慢点
- Alicia. - Maybe you should slow down.

338
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,240
不行  我不明白  我不懂
No, I don't understand this. I don't understand this.

339
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,090
不管去哪里我们都在一起  好吗
Hey, we're together, okay?

340
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,800
营地里什么都有  有食物有住所
We have everything back there. We have food, we have shelter.

341
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,500
-布莱恩  -天呐
- Brian. - Oh, my god.

342
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,270
待在车里
Just stay in the car.

343
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,910
你在做什么
What are you doing?

344
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,060
生存
Surviving.

345
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,020
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

346
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,260
米奇的事情
About Mitch.

347
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,310
进来吧
Come in.

348
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,220
我就知道会这样
I knew this was coming.

349
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,090
我总是得帮他擦屁股
I've been getting him out of trouble my--

350
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,790
皮特呢
Where's Pete?

351
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,740
他死了
He's dead.

352
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,240
现在你也要把我干掉吗
You gonna kill me, too, now?

353
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,460
因为我杀了营地里那个老家伙吗
Huh? For the old guy at the camp?

354
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,850
抽烟吗
Smoke?

355
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,950
你对我哥哥做了什么
Why did you do my brother?

356
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,160
关于那个营地  你说的对
You were right about that camp.

357
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,370
我们应该抢走他们的补给
We should have taken their supplies.

358
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,470
我不在乎你杀了那个老头
I don't care that you killed the old man.

359
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,850
像你哥哥那种人  总是坚持做对的事情
Men like your brother, always doing the right thing,

360
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,260
甚至以自己人为代价
even at the cost of their own people.

361
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,820
抽根烟吧
Go on. Have a cigarette.

362
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,130
我戒了
I quit.

363
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,620
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

364
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,220
我还记得我抽的第一根烟
I remember the first smoke I ever had.

365
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,540
我和我哥挤在车库里
Me and my brother huddled in the garage

366
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,570
吸着我爸的好彩烟
puffing on one of my dad's lucky strikes.

367
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,100
他肯定是闻到了烟味  接着就冲了进来
He must have smelled the smoke, because he came barging in,

368
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,150
想揍我们
looking to beat up on us.

369
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,670
但是我哥哥挡在我前面
But my brother got between us.

370
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,030
说是他偷的
Said he stole them.

371
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,360
根本不是  是我偷的
Wasn't true. It was me.

372
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,870
但我哥哥就是那种人
But that was my brother.

373
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,340
英雄
Hero.

374
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,910
他因此被揍得鼻青脸肿  肋骨断了一根
He got two black eyes and a broken rib for that.

375
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,640
但我还是挨了打
And I got beat anyway.

376
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,410
拿一根吧
Take one.

377
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,940
现在我接管了
I'm running things now,

378
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,160
我会尽我所能保护这个营地
and I will do everything it takes to protect this camp.

379
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,980
如果你加入我  我保证
Now, if you join me, I promise you

380
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,840
你再也不用担心自己的行为
you will never have to worry about whether you were doing

381
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,100
是对还是错
the right thing or the wrong thing.

382
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,130
因为为了营地
Because we will do

383
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,730
我们会做任何事
the only thing.

384
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,920
我们怎么对营地的人说皮特的事
What are we gonna tell the camp about Pete?

385
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,190
就说他在寻找补给时
We'll tell them he died on a supply run

386
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,900
为救我们而死
saving our asses.

387
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,030
你觉得人们会相信吗
You think they're really gonna believe that?

388
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,100
人们相信自己想相信的事
People believe what they want to believe.

389
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,030
人人都爱英雄
Everybody loves a hero.

390
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,590
外围防护如何了
How's the perimeter coming?

391
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,140
快好了  我们用车围起了整个营地
It's good. We got cars ringing almost the entire camp.

392
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,250
再去找点东西
I think a few more runs,

393
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,700
就能建起一个缓冲带了
we should have ourselves a nice little buffer.

394
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,850
坑里呢
And the pits?

395
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,920
行尸不断来  我们不断烧
They keep coming, we keep burning them.

396
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,200
不知道是不是因为太热了
I don't know if it's the heat or what,

397
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,190
最近它们变得非常多
but there have been a hell of a lot more of them lately.

398
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,860
-弹药呢  -充足
- And the armory? - solid.

399
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,000
我收集了营地的所有子弹
I rounded up all the ammo in camp.

400
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,050
我们的子弹都堆满了
We're officially stocked in the bullet department.

401
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,930
但还是告诉你的队员
Still, tell your crews

402
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,530
以后外出搜索只准用弓箭
supply runs are arrow only from now on.

403
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,250
子弹这年头很珍贵
Gunshots are a luxury.

404
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,760
留着它们迟早用的上
Sooner or later we're gonna need 'em.

405
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,310
对  不只是对付行尸
That's right, and not just for the biters.

406
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,280
米奇  我  还有皮特
Mitch and I and Pete,

407
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,410
我们见识过外面的人有多危险
we saw what people can do out there.

408
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,280
如果碰到陌生人  就避开他们
You come across strangers, you just avoid them.

409
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,630
回来告诉我们你在哪里看到了他们
Come back here and tell us where you saw them, okay?

410
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,920
解散
Let's go.

411
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,040
也许我们能找到更好的地方
Maybe we can find a better place.

412
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,160
你知道  如果
You know, if...

413
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,200
我们愿意去争取的话
we're willing to fight for it.

414
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,330
我们不用去找更好的地方
We don't need to find a better place.

415
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,710
这里就是家
This is home.

416
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,940
你是鬼  塔拉姨妈
