1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,330
我知道已经有段日子了
I know it's been a while.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,460
老实说
I'm gonna be honest,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,190
我忘了你
I forgot about you.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,080
离开农场后  我们一直颠沛流离
After the farm, we were always moving.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,950
但是发生了一些事
But something happened.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,060
好事
Something good.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,690
终于发生了
Finally.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,660
我们找到了一座监狱
We found a prison.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,650
爸爸觉得我们可以在这里安家
Daddy thinks that we can make it into a home.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,260
他说我们可以在地里种庄稼
He says we can grow crops in the field,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,400
找些猪和鸡
find pigs and chickens,

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,930
不再逃跑  不再外出觅食
stop running, stop scavenging.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,680
洛莉快生了
Lori's baby is just about due.

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,620
那时她得在个安全的地方
She'll need a safe place when it comes.

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,130
对其余人来说
The rest of us,

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,540
安全已足够
we just need a safe place to be.

17
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,600
昨天我在自己的床上醒来
I woke up in my own bed yesterday.

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,330
属于我的房间里的属于我的床
My own bed in my own room.

19
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,960
但我一直留着背包
But I've been keeping my backpack.

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,960
枪不离身
Keeping my gun close.

21
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,110
我害怕在这里安家
I've been afraid to get my hopes up

22
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,780
只是个奢望
thinking we can actually stay here.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,400
问题是  我担心自己
The thing is, I've been starting to get afraid

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,990
变成了惊弓之鸟
that it's easier just to be afraid.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,090
但今早  爸爸说
But this morning Daddy said something.

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,840
如果你没有希望  那活着还有什么意义
If you don't have hope, what's the point of living?

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,490
所以我解开包  找出了你
So I unpacked my bag and I found you.

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,050
打算再用你记日记
So I'm gonna start writing in you again.

29
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,560
我现在这样写
And I'm gonna write this down now

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,890
是因为你得先写下愿望
because you should write down wishes

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,180
才能实现它们
to make them come true.

32
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,010
我们可以住在这里
We can live here.

33
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,730
我们可以在这里安度余生
We can live here for the rest of our lives.

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,730
我们得做点什么
We should do something.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,950
我们不是唯一的幸存者
We aren't the only survivors.

56
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,530
不可能
We can't be.

57

瑞克  米琼恩  他们可能还活着
Rick, Michonne, they could be out here.

58

玛姬和格伦可能逃出了A区
Maggie and Glenn could have made it out of A block.

59
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,270
有可能的
They could've.

60
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,930
你擅长追踪  你可以找到他们
You're a tracker. You can track.

61
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,010
走啊
Come on.

62
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,490
天快亮了  如果我们现在走  还能...
The sun will be up soon. If we head out now, we can...

63
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,760
好吧  你不去我自己去
Fine. If you won't track, I will.

64
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,120
可能是卢克的脚印  或者是莫莉的
Could be Luke's. Or Molly's.

65
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,720
不管是谁的  说明他们还活着
Whoever they are, it means they're alive.

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,550
不  这说明他们四五个小时之前活着
No. This means they were alive four or five hours ago.

67
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,060
他们还活着
They're alive.

68
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,780
他们从这里开始加速
They picked up the pace right here.

69
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,980
匆匆忙忙跑出来
Got out in a hurry.

70
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
情况变得不妙
Things went bad.

71
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,520
你有点信念会死吗
Wouldn't kill you to have a little faith.

72
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,370
是啊  信念  信念帮不了我们什么
Yeah, faith. Faith ain't done shit for us.

73
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,530
也没能帮上你父亲
Sure as hell didn't do nothing for your father.

74
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,500
我们找到他们时他们肯定很饿
They'll be hungry when we find them.

75
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,160
怎么了
What?

76
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,940
不是行尸的血
That ain't walker blood.

77
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,330
足迹一直往前
The trail keeps going.

78
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,400
他们打退了行尸
They fought them off.

79
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,210
不  到处都是行尸的足迹
No. Got walker tracks all up and down here.

80
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,930
至少有十几个
At least a dozen of them.

81
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,950
走吧
Come on.

82
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,170
我们不会死的
We're not gonna die.

83
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,520
谁也不会
None of us.

84
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,210
我现在相信了
I believe now.

85
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,080
为了我爸爸而相信
I believe for Daddy.

86
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,280
如果这也行不通
If this doesn't work,

87
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,960
我不知道如何坚持下去
I don't know how I could keep going.

88
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,370
别哭
Don't cry.

89
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,320
我想要卡萝尔
I want Carol.

90
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,350
她不在这儿
Well, she's not here.

91

给  别到腰带上
Here, put this on your belt.

92
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,090
天快黑了  我们要去哪
It's gonna get dark soon. Where are we going?

93
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,640
再走远点  跟上
Farther. Come on.

94
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,550
大家都死了吗
Is everybody dead?

95
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,180
它们会听到她的
They're gonna hear her.

96
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,850
我们不该待在这儿
We shouldn't be out here.

97
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,620
我们很快就会找到安全的地方
We'll find a safe place soon.

98
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,400
我们会的
We will.

99
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,730
给
Here.

100
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,570
有行尸
Walkers!

101
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,520
拿着  快点
Here, come on.

102
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,300
走吧  没事的
Let's go. It's okay.

103
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,170
我会给你找到吃的
I'll find you something to eat.

104
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,130
好了  走吧
All right, go.

105
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,190
看  葡萄
Look, grapes.

106
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,480
-可以吃吗  -可以  它们没毒
- Can we eat them?  - Yeah, they're good.

107
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,820
给你  丽兹  吃点吧
Here, Lizzie, have some.

108
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,320
好了  小宝贝
Come on, baby girl.

丽兹  递一张尿布给我
Lizzie, hand me a diaper.

110
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,310
好了  乖  马上就好
It's okay. All right.

111
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,870
再忍耐一下  朱迪思
Bear with me, Judith.

112
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,030
好了  不哭不哭
Okay, that's it. Okay.

113
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,860
它们会听到的
They're gonna hear her.

114
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,090
好了  乖
You're all right. Come on.

115
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,720
没事的  我知道
It's all right. I know. I know.

116
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,060
好了  你想要什么
All right, what do you want?

117
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,390
你想要什么
What do you want, hmm?

118
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,560
嘘  好了  乖
Shh. Shh. Okay, come on.

119
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,070
-它们来了  -我听到了  米卡
- They're coming! - Ah! I heard it, Mica!

120
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,780
不要吼她  她不了解行尸
Don't yell at her. She doesn't understand walkers.

121
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,050
你才不了解行尸
You're the one who doesn't understand them.

122
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,750
好了
Come on.

123
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,930
看好孩子
Watch the baby.

124
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,260
米卡
Mica!

125
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,710
米卡
Mica!

126
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,810
米卡
Mica!

127
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,060
-米卡  -她跑了
- Mica.  - She's gone.

128
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,040
你吼她  她才跑的
You yelled at her and now she's gone.

129
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,820
米卡
Mica!

130
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,480
米卡
Mica.

131
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,550
你还好吗
Are you okay?

132
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,940
我害怕了
I got scared.

133
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,470
没事的  我们都会害怕
That's okay. We all get scared.

134
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,060
遇到危险就该跑
You did the right thing running.

135
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,350
-什么  -她做得没错
- What? - She did.

136
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,490
听到或看到行尸  应拔腿就跑
You hear or see a walker, you run.

137
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,450
不过  如果你在团队中
But when you're in a group,

138
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,800
要尽量和大家待在一起  好吗
you got to try to stay close to them, okay?

139
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,420
你流血了  我伤你很重吗
You're bleeding. Did I hurt your arm bad?

140
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,900
没事  比在监狱里时好多了
It was a lot worse at the prison. No big.

141
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,640
对不起
I'm sorry.

142
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,090
我知道自己做得不如丽兹好
I know I'm not like Lizzie.

143
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,420
不用道歉  你们都有自己的处事方式
Don't be sorry. You each do things your own way.

144
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,260
-但是你们都能做到  -就像你和萨沙
- But you both get it done. - Like you and Sasha?

145
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,580
你才不像萨沙
You're not like Sasha.

146
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,080
为什么
Why not?

147
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,090
因为你还活着
Because you're still here.

148
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,320
而萨沙不是
Sasha isn't.

149
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,140
你要干什么
Wh....What are you doing?

150
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,850
过来
Come on. Come on.

151
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,820
我要让你们眼观六路
I'm making sure you can see in both directions.

152
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,100
你们就这么小心待着
You stay like this and keep watch.

153
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,650
你要丢下我们吗
You're leaving us?

154
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,250
他们可能是监狱的人
They may be from the prison.

155
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,430
-我得帮他们  -我们需要你
- I need to help them. - We need you.

156
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,680
米卡  把你的衬衣塞到匕首后
Mica, tuck your shirt behind your knife

157
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,280
这样更容易拔
so it's easier to grab.

158
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
-我们没事的  -好
- We'll be okay. - Okay.

159
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,400
如果你们看到行尸要怎么办
What do you do when you see a walker?

160
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,980
-跑  -跑
- Run. - Run.

161
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,140
一起朝我这边跑  不到万不得已别开枪
Together, towards me. Only fire if you have to.

162
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,390
就在这里等着我回来  好吗
You stay right here until I get back, okay?

163
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,040
求求你不要走
Please, please don't go.

164
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,310
米卡  看着我
Mica, look at me.

165
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,580
你能应付的
You can handle this.

166
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,120
你很坚强
You're tough.

167
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,010
克里斯  往林子里跑
Chris, head for the woods.

168
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,180
不行
I can't.

169
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,260
乖  朱迪思  安静点
Come on, Judith. Be quiet.

170
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,510
她就是不停
She's not stopping.

171
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,660
拜托了  丽兹  想想办法
Please, Lizzie, do something.

172
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
它们会听到的
They're gonna hear us.

173
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,010
丽兹
Lizzie.

174
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,510
-爸爸  -克里斯多夫
- Ah! Dad! - Christopher!

175
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,580
-爸爸  -克里斯多夫
- Dad! - Christopher!

176
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,320
丽兹  我们该跑了
Lizzie, we have to run.

177
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
丽兹
Lizzie?

178
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,670
丽兹
Lizzie.

179
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,970
小心
Watch out!

180
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,640
泰尔西
Tyreese.

181
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,820
怎么会...
How... how...

182
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,470
你怎么找到我们的
How'd you find us?

183
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,090
你去哪儿了  你怎么...
Where were you? How'd you..

184
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,060
待在这儿  姑娘们
Stay here, girls.

185
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,950
沿着轨道走
Stay on the tracks.

186
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,470
是我的错
That was my mistake.

187
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,330
但是林子里更隐蔽
But the woods have more cover.

188
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,670
不  你不明白
No, you don't understand.

189
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,970
轨道那头有个地方
There's a place up the tracks.

190
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,680
那里很安全  你们可以把孩子们带去
It's safe. You can take the children there.

191
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,500
相信我
Trust me.

192
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,640
拜托了
Please.

193
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,970
沿着轨道走
Follow the tracks.

194
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,920
泰尔西
Tyreese.

195
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,460
我没跑
I didn't run.

196
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,960
我没有丢下丽兹
I didn't leave Lizzie.

197
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,760
看吧  坚强的小姑娘
See that? Tough little lady.

198
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,990
这里有水
There's some water in there.

199
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,500
-还有吃的  -好
- And some food. - Yeah.

200
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,410
给
Here you go.

201
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,970
我没看见你逃出去
I didn't see you get out.

202
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,060
我以为你
I thought you...

203
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800
我当时不在里面
I wasn't there.

204
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,710
还没回去
I hadn't gotten back yet.

205
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,830
瑞克和我发现了一辆车
Rick and I found a car.

206
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,250
他把物资带回了监狱
He took what we had back to the prison

207
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,710
而我
while I...

208
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,010
继续寻找
kept looking.

209
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,250
你看见了吗
Did you see it?

210
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,420
只看到了结尾
I saw the end.

211
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,000
然后
And then...

212
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,380
我看见你跑进了树丛
I saw you running into the woods.

213
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,480
你离得太远了  我跟丢了  但是
You were far away. I lost you, but...

214
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,870
你找到了我们
You found us.

215
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,390
-我就知道你会找到  -是啊
- I knew you would. - Yeah.

216
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,100
也许我们可以绕回去  找到你的车
Hey, maybe we can circle back and find your car.

217
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,260
那些行尸  还有大火
The walkers and the fire...

218
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,770
你不能回那片墓地
you can't go back to a graveyard.

219
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,760
快看
Look.

220
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,120
避难所和社区  欢迎所有人
"Sanctuary for all. Community for all.

221
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,950
抵达就能活命
Those who arrive survive."

222
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,640
终点站

223
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,920
抱歉
Sorry.

224
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,050
你可以笑
You can smile.

225
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,150
你还活着  我理解
You're alive. I get it.

226
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,190
不是因为这个
That's not it.

227
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,920
好了
Okay.

228
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,300
泰尔西也许还活着  萨沙
Tyreese could have made it, Sasha.

229
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,220
我们不知道有没有人逃了出来
We don't know if anybody got out.

230
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,680
不
No.

231
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,670
我们知道
We do.

232
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,410
他怎么样
How's he doing?

233
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,030
不流血了
Bleeding stopped.

234
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,190
他会好的
He'll be all right.

235
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,900
我们背靠河流
Got the water to our backs.

236
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,380
岸边位置有利
Decent vantage points from the bank.

237
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,170
晚上就在这扎营吧
I'm thinking we camp here for the night.

238
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,650
很好
That's good.

239
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,000
你们在这应该很安全
You should both be safe here.

240
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,800
大巴开出去了  格伦也逃出来了
The bus got out. Glenn got out.

241
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,120
我要去找他
I'm gonna find him.

242
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,230
玛姬
Maggie.

243
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,160
如果一切顺利  大巴已经走远了
With any luck, the bus is gone.

244
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,780
它沿着主路向东走了
It was heading east down the main road.

245
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,790
如果我沿这个方向走
If I follow in that direction,

246
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,150
也许可以发现它的踪迹
I might be able to pick up its tracks.

247
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,750
你自己吗  就靠那把刀吗
Alone? With just that?

248
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,300
我没有弹药了  是的
I'm out of ammo, so, yeah.

249
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,770
我没找到贝丝
I couldn't find Beth.

250
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,400
我知道格伦逃出来了  也知道他的路线
I know Glenn got out and I know which way he went.

251
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,060
我要找到他  然后再回来找你们
I'm gonna go get him and I'm gonna come back for you.

252
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,630
-我们两个一起回来  -玛姬
- We both are. - Maggie.

253
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,680
我要去
I'm going.

254
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,650
我们不能分开  现在不能
We cannot split up. Not now.

255
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,270
我去了
I'm going.

256
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,200
你自己说的
You said it.

257
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,690
我们不能分开
We can't split up.

258
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,990
搭车者可能为逃犯

259
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,070
搭车者可能为逃犯

260
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,750
你可以帮我阻止她的
You could have helped me stop her.

261
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,690
如果你这是博我同情  不管用的
If you're trying to make me feel sorry for you, it's not working.

262
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,220
该死  那我不是白挨了一枪
Damn, it means I let myself get shot up for nothing.

263
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,700
我们找到他的可能性...
The odds of us finding him...

264
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,950
我们应该去找食物  住的地方
We should be out looking for food, shelter.

265
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,670
是吗  为什么
Yeah, why is that?

266
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,290
这样才能生存
So we can live.

267
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,880
然后呢
Then what?

268
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,530
什么
What?

269
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,870
也许我们的幸存意味着不能仅仅生存
Maybe we didn't survive just to keep surviving.

270
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,430
世事无常
Shit happens.

271
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,550
不是所有事情都有意义
Not everything has to mean something.

272
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,860
不是必须的  但是可以有
No, it doesn't have to, but it can.

273
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,970
你可以这样想
If you make it that way,

274
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,770
我们也是这样做的
and that's what it seems like we're doing.

275
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,540
这种活法我能接受
And I'm down with that.

276
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,800
玛姬
Maggie.

277
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,230
玛姬
Maggie!

278
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,400
你们该走了
You should go.

279
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,840
玛姬  住手
Maggie, stop.

280
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,150
玛姬  玛姬
Maggie. Maggie.

281
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,800
我一定得弄清楚他在不在里面
I have to know if he's in there.

282
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,010
好吧
Fine,

283
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,060
但我们得一起干
but we do it together.

284
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,230
小心点
Smart.

285
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,000
每次放一个出来
We'll let them out one at a time.

286
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,280
我们得有两个人站在门边
Two of us should be at the door...

287
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,350
防止它们叠在一起顶开门
in case they stack up against it.

288
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,360
我必须站在这里
I have to be here.

289
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,460
我得看它们的脸
I need to see their faces.

290
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,190
我顶不住了
I can't hold it.

291
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,330
抱歉
I'm sorry.

292
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,720
但他们逃出来了啊
But they got away.

293
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,400
他们都是好人
They were good people.

294
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,270
全部都是
All of them.

295
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,360
你应该让我来
You should let me.

296
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,540
玛姬
Maggie?

297
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,460
玛姬
Maggie!

298
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,290
子弹是满的
It's full.

299
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,750
你一枪都没开吗
Did you even fire a shot?

300
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,540
好吧  走吧
All right. Let's go.

301
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,680
走啊
Let's go.

302
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,090
你就打算待在这儿了吗
Are you just gonna stay here, huh?

303
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,270
你打算送死吗
You're just gonna die?

304
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,860
我和他们是一伙的
I was part of this.

305
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,730
我知道
I know.

306
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,560
那你这是做什么
So what are you doing?

307
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,650
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

308
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,290
我们的子弹不多了
We're gonna run out of bullets.

309
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,660
拿着这个  还有这个
Take this and take this.

310
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,380
退开
Back up.

311
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,890
好了  我要你走在我前面  行吗
All right. I need you to stay ahead of me, okay?

312
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,790
我会掩护你  但我一个人做不到
All right. I'll cover you, but I can't do it alone.

313
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,960
准备好了吗
You ready?

314
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,250
走吧
Let's go.

315
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,030
快  走  走  走
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

316
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,380
开枪  开枪  走吧
Shoot! Shoot! Come on!

317
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,250
你有没有看见我们的人逃出来
Did you see if any of my people got out?

318
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,210
我只见我姐姐出现在那片空地上
All I saw was my sister in that field.

319
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,380
她本不应该出现在那里
She wasn't supposed to be there.

320
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,790
她有枪  但它们向她涌了过去
She had a gun, but they just swarmed her.

321
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,240
她不该在那儿的
She wasn't supposed to be there.

322
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,100
我为他才这么做的  我信任他
I did it for him. I trusted him.

323
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,660
但他却杀了那个老人
And then he just killed that old man.

324
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,120
赫谢尔
Hershel?

325
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,760
他的名字是赫谢尔吗
Was his name Hershel?

326
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,140
对不起
I'm sorry.

327
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,700
真的对不起
I'm so sorry.

328
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,840
布莱恩跟我们说你们是坏人
Brian, that man, told us you were bad people.

329
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,580
我知道那不是真的
I know it's not true.

330
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,100
我能看出来
I can see it's not,

331
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,550
所以我们的所作所为  我的所作所为...
so what we did, what I did...

332
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,310
我太混账了
I mean, I'm a piece of shit.

333
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,900
你为什么还想要我帮忙
Why would you want my help?

334
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,610
我不是想要  我是需要
I don't want it, I need it.

335
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,230
我得找到玛姬
I have to find Maggie.

336
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,120
玛姬是谁
Who's Maggie?

337
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,410
我妻子
She's my wife.

338
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,940
你俩失散了吗
You guys got separated?

339
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,470
我当时在巴士上
I was on the bus and then

340
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,230
然后我下车去帮忙  她没看到我
I got off to help and she didn't see me.

341
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,840
你怎么知道她活下来了
How do you know if she made it?

342
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,640
我不知道
I don't know.

343
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,590
但是赫谢尔
But Hershel,

344
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,530
玛姬的父亲  是个伟大的人
Maggie's father, was a great man.

345
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,230
他跟我说过  只要有信念就行
And he told me all I had to do was believe,

346
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,340
而我正打算这么做
and that's what I'm gonna do.

347
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,800
咱俩都能活着是万幸
Neither one of us should be alive right now.

348
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,220
她逃出去了  所以你得帮我找到她
She got out, so you're gonna help me find her.

349
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,820
事情还没完
Things aren't over.

350
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,420
他们还没死
They're not over.

351
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,340
我也想这样相信
I want to believe that.

352
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,310
我也想
I want to.

353
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,580
你必须相信
You have to.

354
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,530
格伦  格伦
Glenn. Glenn.

355
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,810
格伦
Hey, Glenn.

356
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,700
希望你们看得开心  混蛋
Hope you enjoyed the show, assholes.

357
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,700
你有一条毒舌  知道吗
You got a damn mouth on you, you know that?

358
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,790
你还有什么
What else you got?
