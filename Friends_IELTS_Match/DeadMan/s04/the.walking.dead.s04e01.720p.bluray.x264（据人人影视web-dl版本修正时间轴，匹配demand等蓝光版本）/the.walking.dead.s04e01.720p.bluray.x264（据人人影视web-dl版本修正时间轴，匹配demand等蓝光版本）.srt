你没叫醒我
You didn't wake me up.

19
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,340
因为我知道你整晚没睡
'Cause I knew you were up all night

20
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,200
一直在用手电筒看漫画
reading comics with a flashlight.

21
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,600
维奥莉特怎么了
What's up with Violet?

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,280
卡尔  我告诉过你别给它们取名字
Carl, I told you not to name them.

23
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,020
它们不再是小猪了  而是食物
They're not piglets anymore. They're food.

24
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,760
我只是觉得  直到...
I just thought, you know, until...

25
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,520
好吧
Okay.

26
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,580
我不知道她怎么了
I don't know what's going on with her.

27
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,310
可能生病了  也可能没事
Could be sick, could be nothing.

28
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,190
早日康复  维奥莉特
Feel better, Violet.

29
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,830
走  我们去忙吧
Come on, let's get to it.

30
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,710

好啊  S医生
What's up, Dr. S?

32
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,390
-早上好  达里尔  -早上好  达里尔
- Morning, Daryl. - Morning, Daryl.

33
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,280
好啊  达里尔
Hey, Daryl!

34
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,330
闻起来挺香的
Smells good.

35
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,290
记住啊  是我先喜欢你的
Just so you know, I liked you first.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
打住
Stop.

37
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,130
瑞克也带了很多人回来
You know, Rick brought in a lot of them, too.

38
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,610
最近没有
Not recently.

39
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,850
庇护陌生人
Give the stranger sanctuary,

40
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,560
给他们吃的
keeping people fed,

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
你得学会宽容的生活
you're gonna have to learn to live with the love.

42
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,580
是啊
Right.

43
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,270
我带你去看样东西
I need you to see something.

44
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,720
帕特里克  你能来接手吗
Patrick, you want to take over?

45
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,930
好  女士
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,430
迪克森先生
Mr. Dixon,

47
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,330
我只想感谢你昨天带回了那头鹿
I just wanted to thank you for bringing that deer back yesterday.

48
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,330
我们真是大饱口福  先生
It was a real treat, sir.

49
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,610
如果能和你握手  我将倍感荣幸
And I'd be honored to shake your hand.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,430
今天  
About today,

51
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,380
不知道我们这边能否分出人进城
I don't know if we're gonna be able to spare a lot of people for the run.

52
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,470
那个地方已经清空了  我们会继续推进
That place is good to go. We're gonna move on it.

53
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,510
是啊
Yeah.

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,400
问题是  一夜之间行尸暴增
The thing is, we had a pretty big buildup overnight.

55
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,180
三号塔那边更多
Dozens more towards tower three.

56
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,700
情况和上个月一样糟
It's getting as bad as last month.

57
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,310
它们不再分散了 
They don't spread out anymore.

58
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,020
人越多  就会吸引越多的行尸
With more of us sitting here, we're drawing more of them out.

59
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,730
很多行尸
You get enough of those

60
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,950
趴在围栏边  然后越聚越多
damn fence-clingers, they start to herd up.

61
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,910
又来推围墙了
Pushing against the fences again.

62
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,770
还撑得住  但得尽快行动  不然坚持不久 
It's manageable, but unless we get ahead of it, not for long.

63
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,870
要辛苦你了  宝贝儿
Sorry, Pookie.

64
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,580
喜欢那样吧
You like that?

65
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,600
我觉得你今天还是别去了
I don't think you should go today.

66
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,930
真的吗
Really?

67
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,030
真的
Yeah.

68
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,690
我们有防爆服
We have the suits.

69
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,320
但你不用去
Yeah, but you don't have to go.

70
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,890
你不应该去
You shouldn't.

71
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,540
你知道一切都会好的  对吧
You know everything's gonna work out, right?

72
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,070
对吧
Right?

73
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,750
对
Right.

74
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,230
对
Right.

75
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,070
但你得留下  行吗
But you're staying, okay?

76
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,870
好吧
Fine.

77
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,730
你好  美女
Hey, beautiful.

78
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,270
你也好
Hey yourself.

79
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,050
-去穿个围裙  -好
- You need an apron. - Yeah.

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,380
能和你谈谈吗
Listen, can we talk?

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,730
我打算今天跟他们出去
I was thinking of going on the run today.

82
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,170
行啊
Okay.

83
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,350
我不喜欢隔着围栏爆它们的头
I don't like killing them on the fence.

84
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,000
讨厌的很
I hate it.

85
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,010
而在外面  它们向着你走过来
I mean, when they're coming at you out there,

86
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,130
那是不同的
it's different.

87
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,670
你想都不用想
You don't even think about it.

88
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,350
当它们层层趴在围栏上时
When they're stacked up against the chain-link,

89
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,470
面对面  我...
you're just face-to-face. I...

90
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,920
我只是想做点别的来帮忙
I just wanted to do something different to help out.

91
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,510
可你总是自告奋勇来做这事
You always volunteered to do it.

92
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,990
那是因为你总是在做
That's because you were always doing it.

93
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,740
我想多点机会了解你
Just thought I could get to know you.

94
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,540
你做到了
You did.

95
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,340
在外面小心点
You be careful out there.

96
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,230
我正想找你
I was just gonna come find you.

97
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,420
找我什么事
What's up?

98
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,490
委员会把大家从煤炭小队撤回来
Well, the council pulled back everyone on the coal crew

99
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,150
准备组织外出
from going on the run.

100
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,120
他们现在缺人手
They're shorthanded right now.

101
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,810
我觉得应该加入他们
I figured I'd step up to help, go with 'em.

102
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,170
只是想在走之前见你一面
Just, you know, wanted to make sure that I saw you before.

103
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,180
好吧
Okay.

104
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,330
我只是... 你知道的
I just-- 'cause, you know,

105
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,620
出去很危险
it's dangerous going out there.

106
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,600
我知道
I know.

107
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,610
好吧  那不跟我道别吗
Okay, are you gonna say good-bye?

108
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,550
才不呢
Nope.

109
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,440
整的跟言情小说似的
It's like a damn romance novel.

110
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,150
我想跟你们一起去
I'd like to start pulling my weight around here.

111
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,440
鲍勃  这才过了一周
Bob, it's only been a week.

112
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,010
这一周我能吃上饭
That's a week worth of meals,

113
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,720
有个安身之处
a roof over my head.

114
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,210
让我也发光发热好继续待在这里
Let me earn my keep.

115
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,520
-达里尔找到你时  你孤身一人  -是的
- You were out on your own when Daryl found you. - That's right.

116
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,110
我想知道  你会团队作战吗
I just want to make sure you know how to play on a team.

117
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,900
如果很困难  我们也不会去
We ain't gonna do it unless it's easy.

118
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,750
他可是军医
You know he was a medic in the Army.

119
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,090
你还真是难搞定  你知道吗
You a hell of a tough sell. You know that?

120
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,710
好吧
Okay.

121
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,630
这些叶子都会长在背阳处
These leaves are gonna be in the shade,

122
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,080
因此长不出什么好果子
so we won't get any good fruit from it.

123
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,250
所以我们就把它从这里掐断
So we just pinch it off here.

124
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,040
根茎断了  但它们还能生长
Things break, but they can still grow.

125
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,890
这些小枝  它们会扎根
These little bristles, they'll take root

126
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,790
然后我们就会有棵全新的植物了
and we'll have a whole new plant.

127
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,680
走吧
Let's go.

128
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,250
见到你我们真开心
We're glad to see you.

129
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,810
见到你们我也很开心
Glad to see you, too.

130
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,670
有人中头彩了
Somebody hit the jackpot.

131
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,280
不可能吧
No way.

132
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,990
太棒了  谢谢
Awesome! Thank you.

133
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,520
你看完了轮我看
I get to read 'em when you're done.

134
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,680
我还找到了这个
And I found this.

135
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,910
你脸上一片狼藉
Your face is losing the war.

136
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,400
你要待一段时间吗
You gonna stay a little while?

137
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,120
就待一会儿
Just a little while.

138
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,800
看看谁回来了
Well, look who's back.

139
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,940
我没找到他
Didn't find him.

140
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,490
真高兴看到你安全归来
Glad to see you in one piece.

141
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,560
我寻思着要在梅肯附近找找
I'm thinking of looking over near Macon.

142
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,980
这值得一试
It's worth a shot.

143
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,810
七十里路满是行尸
70 miles of walkers.

144
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,440
你有可能碰上几个不太友好的
You might run into a few unneighborly types.

145
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,360
不是吗
Is it?

146
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,860
我去看看基地
I'm gonna go check out the Big Spot.

147
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,410
我之前说过的那个  就去看看
The one I was talking about, just seeing.

148
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,020
是啊  我得出去检查一下陷阱
Yeah, I got to go out and check the snares.

149
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,630
我可不想把我们抓到的东西白白让给行尸
I don't want to lose whatever we catch to the walkers.

150
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,980
我去吧
I'll go.

151
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,770
你刚到这呢
You just got here.

152
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,850
我会回来的
And I'll be back.

153
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,990
-你要去检查陷阱  -是的
- Going to check the snares? - I am.

154
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,540
你不能去  去做你的杂事
You're not. Do your chores.

155
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,060
看你的漫画  或者读几本书
Read comics. Maybe some books, too.

156
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,830
去找帕特里克玩
Hang out with Patrick.

157
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
也许去参加故事会
Maybe go to story time.

158
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,720
老爸  那是小孩干的事
Dad, that's for kids.

159
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,960
是呀
Yeah.

160
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,640
现在  刷刷她
Now brush her down.

161
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,310
留在这里没什么不对的  瑞克
Nothing wrong with staying close, Rick.

162
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,320
每个人都能理解
Everyone understands.

163
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,280
你为我们种了足够的庄稼
You're growing us enough food

164
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,320
近期内你不用再四处奔波了
so we won't need to do runs soon.

165
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,680
但我们得给你找一套好点的连体工服了
But we do have to find you a good pair of overalls.

166
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,910
你看上去得像点样
You need to look the part.

167
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,540
嘴角上叼一株小麦
A little piece of wheat out of the corner of your mouth.

168
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,560
再长个农夫大臀
Maybe a bigger ass.

169
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,240
听着  委员会里其余的人
Listen, the rest of the council--

他们都想要我和你谈谈
they wanted me to talk to you.

173
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,190
当你出去的时候
When you go out there,

174
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,420
你必须得带上你的枪
you got to take your gun.

175
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,610
别担心
Easy now.

176
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,390
只不过是去围栏外
It's just outside the fence.

177
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,910
我带着我的刀呢
I have my knife.

178
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,010
我遇到麻烦的话  六发子弹也没什么用
I get in trouble, six bullets isn't gonna make the difference.

179
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,710
瑞克  我们不想让你出事
Rick, we want you to be safe.

180
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,420
带着你的枪
Bring your gun.

181
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,920
等等
Wait.

182
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,760
求你了

183
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,430
求你

184
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,990
求你帮帮我
Please help me.

我知道你不认识我
I know you don't know me.

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,250
但是你能帮我把这个带给我丈夫吗
But can you please help me get this to my husband?

188
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,620
我们已经好几天没吃饭了
We haven't eaten in days.

189
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,740

谢谢
Thank you.

191

你在这附近有营地吗
Do you have a camp around here?

192
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,970
有
Yeah.

193
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,740
我们能不能跟你回去
Could we possibly come back with you?

194
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,240
我们自己
We've been doing...

195
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,810
很难熬
very badly on our own.

196
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,920
我得见见他
I'd have to meet him.

197
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,030
我要问他几个问题  问你们俩
I need to ask him some questions, both of you.

198
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,080
什么问题
What questions?

199
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,560
就问三个
Just three.

200
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,720
我们到了再说
When we get there.

201
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,810
你身上有枪吗
You have a gun on you?

202
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,940
我能确认一下吗
Can I make sure?

203
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,970
好
Yeah.

204
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,220
我不认识你
Look, I don't know you,

205
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,060
所以我警告你
so I'm just gonna tell you this.

206
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,460
你要是跟我耍花招
You try anything--

207
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,470
任何花招
anything--

208
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,940
输的人会是你
you're gonna be the one who loses.

209
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,940
我已经一无所有了
I don't have anything else to lose.

210
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,680
不
No.

211
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,590
你有
You do.

212
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,260
拿着
Go ahead.

213
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,170
尼克  看这边
Nick, look over here.

214
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,330
这是维恩
This one's Wayne.

215
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,170
-尼克  -尼克  看这边
- Nick. - Nick, over here.

216
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,490
嗨  尼克
Hi, Nick!

217
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,020
-嗨  尼克  -你们给它们起名字了
- Hi, Nick. - You're naming them?

218
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,020
有一个行尸有名牌
Well, one of them has a name tag,

219
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,510
我们就觉得它们都应该有名字
so we thought all of them should.

220
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,180
它们活着的时候有名字  它们已经死了
They had names when they were alive. They're dead now.

221
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,910
不  它们没死  只是不一样了
No, they're not. They're just different.

222
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,110
你到底在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

223
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,360
它们不能说话
Okay, they don't talk.

224
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
不能思考  它们吃人
They don't think. They eat people.

225
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,520
它们杀人
They kill people.

226
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,860
普通人也杀人  但他们还是有名字
People kill people. They still have names.

227
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,450
你们见过发生的事吗
Have you seen what happens?

228
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,740
你们见过有人那样死去的情景吗
Have you seen someone die like that?

229
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,580
是的  见过
Yeah, I have.

230
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,590
它们不是人  也不是宠物
They're not people and they're not pets.

231
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,890
别给它们起名字
Don't name them.

232
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,670
我们应该去看书  走吧
We're supposed to go read. Come on.

233
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,600
你今晚参加故事会吗
You coming to story time tonight?

234
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,180
好
Uh, yeah.

235
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,670
到时见
See you then.

236
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,050
我有时参加  我很幼稚
I go sometimes. I'm immature.

237
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,130
你不会喜欢的  是小孩的游戏
You wouldn't dig it. It's for kids.

238
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,730
我也走了
I'm gonna head up there, too.

239
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,480
一会儿再聊  小长官
I'll catch you later, young sir.

240
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,400
好
Yep.

241
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,860
军队来后竖起了这些围栏
Army came in and put these fences up.

242
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,940
建了一个避难基地
Made it a place for the people to go.

243
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,000
上周我们发现这个地方的时候
Last week when we spotted this place,

244
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,560
铁丝网后面有很多行尸
there was a bunch of walkers behind this chain-link

245
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,030
就像看门狗一样不让人进去
keeping people out like a bunch of guard dogs.

246
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,990
它们都离开了吗
So they all just left?

247
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,410
你听
Give a listen.

248
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,590
你把它们引走了
You drew 'em out.

249
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,720
三天前放了一个录音机在那儿
Put a boom box out there three days ago.

250
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,750
接在两块车用蓄电池上
Hooked it up to two car batteries.

251
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,520
好吧  我们来扫荡吧
All right, let's make a sweep.

252
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,210
注意安全  尽量多拿
Make sure it's safe. Grab what you can.

253
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,000
明天我们带更多的人过来
We'll come back tomorrow with more people.

254
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,360
来吧
Come on.

255
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,250
等一下
Just give it a second.

256
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,240
好吧  我觉得我明白了
Okay, I think I got it.

257
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,670
明白什么
Got what?

258
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,250
我一直想知道达里尔以前是干什么的
I've been trying to guess what Daryl did before the turn.

259
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,130
他已经瞎猜了差不多六个星期了
He's been trying to guess for, like, six weeks.

260
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,000
我在慢慢猜
Yeah, I'm pacing myself.

261
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,530
每天试一次
One shot a day.

262
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,050
好吧  说说看
All right, shoot.

263
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,390
你在监狱里的行为方式
Well, the way you are at the prison,

264
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,300
你是委员会成员  你会追踪
you being on the council, you're able to track,

265
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,500
你帮助人们  但是你还是有点
you're helping people, but you're still being kind of...

266
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,930
阴沉
surly.

267
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,170
然后我就懂了
Big swing here.

268
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,660
你是凶案警察
Homicide cop.

269
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,350
有什么好笑的
What's so funny?

270
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,050
没什么  相当说得通
Nothing. It makes perfect sense.

271
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,460
其实这家伙说的没错
Actually, the man's right.

272
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,760
我是卧底警察
Undercover.

273
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,290
-不会吧  真的吗  -真的
- Come on, really? - Yep.

274
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,060
我不喜欢谈论这个
I don't like to talk about it

275
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,100
因为真的挺操蛋的  你懂吗
'cause it was a lot of heavy shit, you know?

276
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,930
伙计  可别骗我  真的吗
Dude, come on, really?

277
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,540
好吧  看来我得接着猜了
Okay. I'll just keep guessing, I guess.

278
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,270
没错  接着猜吧
Yeah, you keep doing that.

279
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,650
-我们要开始吗  探长  -干吧
- We're gonna do this, Detective? - Let's do it.

280
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,420
好吧  我们进去  扫荡时保持队形
All right, we go in, stay in formation for the sweep.

281
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,290
你们都知道该找什么
After that, you all know what you're supposed to look for.

282
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,430
还有问题吗
Any questions?

283
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,470
我有没有没被你使唤过
Was there ever a time that you weren't the boss of me?

284
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,970
我出生之前有那么几年吧
You had a few years before I was born.

285
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,050
我们当时准备去巴亚尔塔港度蜜月
We were going to Puerto Vallarta for our honeymoon.

286
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,440
他们关闭了机场
When they shut down the airports,

287
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,740
我们的转接航班再也没出现
our connecting flight never connected.

288
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,970
我们不许离开航站楼  所以
They wouldn't let us leave the terminal, so...

289
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,750
我们就睡在
we slept next to these huge

290
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,820
来自津巴布韦的巨型大理石雕塑边
marble sculptures from Zimbabwe.

291
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,520
第四天夜里
Then, on the fourth night,

292
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,020
那些东西就进来了
the things just came through.

293
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,700
一开始我们有很多人
There were a lot of us and...

294
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,530
但现在只剩下埃迪和我了
now it's just Eddie and me.

295
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,420
如果不是因为他
And I wouldn't have made it

296
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,310
我根本挺不过来
if it wasn't for him.

297
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,910
如果不是因为
And it isn't that...

298
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,050
他一次又一次地救了我
he saved me over and over again

299
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,680
或者让我明白
or that he showed me the things

300
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,890
有些事不得不做  或者
that I had to do or...

301
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,920
应该主动去做
to be willing to do.

302
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,730
要不是因为他还在这里
If he wasn't still here...

303
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,930
我  我也早就完了
I-- I couldn't be.

304
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,840
我就是  我做不到
I just-- I couldn't.

305
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,370
你指什么事
What were they?

306
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,900
什么
What?

307
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
那些你不得不主动去做的事
The things you had to be willing to do?

308
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,680
吃我们能找到的任何食物
Eeating whatever we could find--

309
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,980
动物尸体
animal carcasses

310
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,800
腐烂的水果  还有
and rotten fruit-- and...

311
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,430
抛弃其他人
leaving people behind.

312
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,530
躲开那些需要援助的人
Hiding from people who needed my help.

313
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,570
你就不一样
Unlike you.

314
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,780
我也不是做慈善的
This is not charity.

315
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,440
人必须集体行动
You have to have numbers.

316
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,280
人是对抗行尸的最好武器
People are the best defense against walkers

317
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,410
或者对抗其他人
or people.

318
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,180
我们互相帮助
We help each other.

319
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,790
你管它们叫"行尸"
You call them "Walkers"?

320
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,490
你还好吧  有受伤吗
You all right? You cut or something?

321
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,660
没有  但我的脚被压住了
No, man, but my foot is caught.

322
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,530
好的  他被压住了  来帮我一把
All right. He's just caught. Come on, help me up.

323
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,770
-出什么事了  -大家都没事
- What happened? - Everyone's all right.

324
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,340
只是被红酒和啤酒淹没了
We're over in wine and beer.

325
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,550
我动作可快了  伙计  直接冲向酒瓶
I was moving fast, man. I drove right into the drinks.

326
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,860
伙计  是你运气好
Man, you lucked out.

327
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,970
这东西要是再偏一点...
If this thing had come down on you the wrong way...

328
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,030
我们该走了
Yeah, uh, we should probably go now.

329
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,760
鲍勃还被压着  把他弄出来
Bob's still stuck. Get him out of there.

330
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,430
我们去找其他人
We'll get the others.

331
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,710
我曾在机场看过那些雕塑
I saw those sculptures at the airport once.

332
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,060
我最喜欢孩子玩跳背游戏的那尊
My favorite was the kids playing leapfrog.

333
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,030
我也是
Mine, too.

334
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,890
埃迪和我不得不做的那些事
What Eddie and I had to do,

335
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,460
你也做过吗
did you do things like that?

336
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,690
做过吗
Did you?

337
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,030
你觉得做过那些事后  还能回到过去吗
Do you think you get to come back from them?

338
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,540
我希望如此
I hope so.

339
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,240
是吗
Yeah?

340
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,080
希望我们对你三个问题的回答
I hope we answer your three questions

341
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
能让你们满意
to your satisfaction.

342
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,120
达里尔  快走
Daryl, go!

343
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,470
把鲍勃弄出来
Let's get Bob.

344
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,460
再挪一点
More, more.

345
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,030
快  必须得走了
Come on, time to go.

346
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,900
走吧  快走  快
Let's go, now! Come on! Go!

347
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,990
扎克
Zack!

348
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,900
走吧  快走
Go, go!

349
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,140
就在前面了[双关]
It's just ahead.

350
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,430
埃迪
Eddie.

351
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,770
谢天谢地你还在这里
Oh, thank God you're still here.

352
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,350
他是瑞克
This is Rick.

353
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,340
他会帮助我们
He's gonna help us.

354
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,150
一切都会好的
Everything's gonna be okay.

355
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,920
一切
Everything--

356
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,090
可恶
Damn it!

357
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,190
我本来想把野猪带回来
I wanted to take the boar.

358
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,990
可我知道带你过来会更快
I just knew-- I knew I'd get you here so much quicker.

359
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,220
他饿坏了
He's starving.

360
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,790
他越来越蔫  他需要吃活物
He's slowing. He needs something alive.

361
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,960
求你  我说过  我不能没有他
Please, I told you, I can't be without him.

362
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,650
所以我才留着他
And so I kept him.

363
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,210
这是错的
It was wrong.

364
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,220
我不能做这种事
I can't do things like this.

365
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,550
但你必须这样做
And-- and you have to do things like this.

366
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,490
让我和他一样吧
Let me be like him.

367
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,240
不要阻拦
Don't stop it.

368
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,960
不要在这之后杀掉我们
Don't end it after.

369
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,890
-不  -让我同他在一起吧
- No. - Let me be with him.

370
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,680
不要
No!

371
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,950
你的...
What were...

372
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,980
问题是什么
the questions?

373
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,440
那三个问题
The three questions?

374
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,140
你杀过多少行尸
How many walkers have you killed?

375
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,680
埃迪
Eddie--

376
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,990
埃迪把它们都杀了
Eddie killed-- killed them all.

377
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,660
直到...
Until...

378
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,860
你杀过多少活人
How many people have you killed?

379
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,520
只有我自己
Just me.

380
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,920
只有我自己
Just me.

381
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,810
为什么
Why?

382
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,550
你没法
You don't--

383
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,390
你没法回到过去
you don't get to come back.

384
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,320
有些事一旦发生  你就没法
You don't get to come back

385
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,010
回到过去
from things.

386
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,880
回不去...
You don't...

387
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,080
"孩子们盯着蜡烛
The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle

388
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,810
看着它缓缓地  无情地融化
and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away.

389
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,590
最后只剩半寸孤独的灯芯
Saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last.

390
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,600
微弱的火苗忽上忽下
Saw the feeble flame rise and fall.

391
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,430
顺着轻烟而上
Climb the thin tower of smoke.

392
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,640
徘徊片刻  之后..."
Linger at its top a moment and then..."

393
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,340
女士  我该去放哨了吗
Ma'am, should I take watch now?

394
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,110
好的  卢克  去吧
Yes, Luke, you do that.

395
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,570
今天
Today...

396
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,300
我们来学习刀具的用法
We are talking about knives-- how to use them,

397
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,890
如何安全地使用  如何用它们救命
how to be safe with them, and how they could save your life.

398
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,780
女士  我能先走吗
Ma'am, may I be dismissed?

399
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,720
-怎么  -我不太舒服
- What is it? - I'm not feeling very well.

400
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,940
有时你要克服一下
Sometimes you're gonna have to fight through it.

401
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,540
万一你独自在外怎么办
What if you wind up out there alone?

402
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,100
因为不舒服就放弃自己吗
You just give up because you're feeling bad?

403
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,840
不  我只是不想吐在别人身上
No, it's just I don't want to yack on somebody.

404
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,080
去吧
Go.

405
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,750
好  今天我们学习如何握刀
Okay, today we're gonna learn how to hold a knife,

406
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,120
怎么砍刺  该瞄准哪里
how to stab and slash and where to aim for.

407
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,420
拜托  不要告诉你父亲
Please, don't tell your father.

408
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,660
怎么了
What?

409
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,990
我也不想去外面
I don't like going out there, either.

410
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,800
达里尔会告诉贝丝
Daryl's telling Beth.

411
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,670
这是没办法的事
There's nothing else to do.

412
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,400
我去找她
I'll go see her.

413
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,390
我没怀孕
I'm not pregnant.

414
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,840
-你知道了吗  -知道了
- You know? - I know.

415
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,250
天啊
Oh, my God.

416
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,280
我没打算要孩子  但我们可以要
I didn't want to, but we could have.

417
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,990
我们可以在这里生活
We can have lives here.

418
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,650
经历了洛莉和今天的事
How can you say that after today?

419
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,570
你怎能还这么说
After Lori?

420
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,560
因为我不想害怕活着
Because I don't want to be afraid of being alive.

421
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,750
会害怕才让我们活到了今天
Being afraid is what's kept us alive.

422
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,580
不是
No.

423
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,410
我们这只是苟延残喘
It's how we kept breathing.

424
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,710
-嗨  -嗨
-Hey.  -Hi.

425
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,660
怎么了
What is it?

426
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,060
扎克
Zack.

427
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,400
他死了吗
Is he dead?

428
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,220
噢
Okay.

429
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,400
30天无事故

430
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,240
30天无事故

431
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,330
0天无事故

432
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,210
怎么
What?

433
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,180
我再也不会哭了
I don't cry anymore, Daryl.

434
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,380
我只是觉得很高兴认识了他
I'm just glad I got to know him, you know?

435
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,200
我也是
Me, too.

436
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,780
你还好吧
Are you okay?

437
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,780
只是厌倦了同伴的离去
Just tired of losing people is all.

438
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,930
我很庆幸没有跟他道别
I'm glad I didn't say good-bye.

439
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,220
我讨厌道别
I hate good-byes.

440
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,830
我也是
Me, too.

441
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,590
梅肯

442
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,300
你试图帮她
You tried to help her.

443
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,320
你帮不了  没人帮得了
You couldn't. No one could.

444
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,930
有些人已经病入膏肓
Some people are too far gone.

445
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,170
而你没有
You're not.

446
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,920
你试图帮她
You tried to help her.

447
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,040
那个女人的状态
How that woman wound up,

448
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,310
我也差点成那样
I got close to that.

449
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,470
如果我失去了卡尔和朱迪思
If I lost Carl and Judith,

450
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,630
失去这个地方
if I lost this place--

451
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,920
不会的  瑞克  即使那样也不会
Not then, Rick. Not even then.

452
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,670
你回来了
You came back.

453
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,500
你的儿子回来了
Your boy came back.

454
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,050
你一定不会迷失
You get to come back. You do.
