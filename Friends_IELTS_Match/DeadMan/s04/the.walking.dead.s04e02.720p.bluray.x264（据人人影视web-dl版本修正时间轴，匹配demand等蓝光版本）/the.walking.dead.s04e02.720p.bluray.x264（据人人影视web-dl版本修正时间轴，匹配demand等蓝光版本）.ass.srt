116
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,720
我得给你截肢  免得感染扩散
I'm gonna have to amputate your arm to stop the infection from spreading.

117
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,040
把牢房全部查一遍
Check all of 'em-- every cell.

118
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,430
我马上给你做手术 
I have to do it now.

119
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,110
你把这个咬住
I want you to bite this.

120
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,980
-下面安全了吧  -对
- Are we clear down here? - Yeah.

121
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,850
-我们安全了吗  -是的
- We're safe? - Yeah, yeah.

122
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,950
上来
Up here!

123
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,790
没事了
It's okay.

124
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,890
蹲下
Get down!

125
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,980
谢了
Thanks.

126
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,820
天呐  是帕特里克
Oh, it's Patrick.

127
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,290
都是他们区的人
That's all of 'em.

128
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,750
我开始变异了  对不对
It's happening, isn't it?

129
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,480
你受到了惊吓
You're in shock, okay?

130
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,390
我想让你好好躺着
I want you just to lay back.

131
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,250
丽兹和米卡
Lizzie and Mica,

132
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,390
你关心她们
you care about them.

133
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,680
我亲眼见过
I've seen it.

134
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,000
我没有其他亲人了
I don't have anybody else.

135
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
孩子们靠自己的话
Kids on their own,

136
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,580
无法活下去
they don't have a chance.

137
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,940
你能照顾她们吗
Can you look out for them?

138
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,950
视如己出
Like they're yours?

139
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,200
能
Yeah.

140
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,650
我能
Yeah, I can.

141
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,770
我会的
I will.

142
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,140
瑞恩
Ryan.

143
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,950
你得让她们来跟你告别
You're gonna have to let them say goodbye.

144
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,840
好吗
Okay?

145
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,860
好的
Okay.

146
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,720
没被咬  没受伤
No bites. No wounds.

147
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,940
他是正常死亡
I think he just died.

148
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,530
死得很惨  吸入性胸膜炎
Horribly, too. Pleurisy aspiration.

149
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,880
被自己的血液呛死
Choked to death on his own blood.

150
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,640
所以脸上全是血
Caused those trails down his face.

151
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,140
我在栅栏外的行尸
I've seen them before

152
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,040
脸上见到过
on a walker outside the fences.

153
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,310
我也在帕特里克脸上见过
I saw them on Patrick, too.

154
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,140
因肺内的压力不断增加
They're from the internal lung pressure building up--

155
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,350
好比你摇一瓶汽水  就会把瓶盖崩开
like if you shake a soda can and pop the top.

156
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,140
你的眼睛
Only imagine your eyes,

157
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,590
耳朵  鼻子和喉咙好比瓶盖
ears, nose, and throat are the top.

158
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,660
是被行尸传染的吗
It's a sickness from the walkers?

159
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,830
不是  它们出现之前就有这种病
No, these things happened before they were around.

160
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,890
可能是肺炎球菌
Could be pneumococcal.

161
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,590
很可能是一种急性流感
Most likely an aggressive flu strain.

162
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,070
有人及时把他关了起来
Someone locked him in just in time.

163
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,040
不是  查理经常梦游
No, man. Charlie used to sleepwalk.

164
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,640
是他把自己锁起来的  他昨天还吃烤肉来着
Locked himself in. Hell, he was just eating barbecue yesterday.

165
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,310
怎么会有人得了感冒一天就死了
How could somebody die in a day just from a cold?

166
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,960
有头猪病了  死得很快
I had a sick pig, it died quick.

167
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,850
我在林子里见过一头病死的野猪
Saw a sick boar in the woods.

168
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,490
猪和禽类  过去疾病都是通过这些动物传染的
Pigs and birds. That's how these things spread in the past.

169
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,660
我们得处理一下那些猪
We need to do something about those hogs.

170
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,040
可能我们很幸运  只有这么两例
Maybe we got lucky. Maybe these two cases are it.

171
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,540
这年头没人幸运
Haven't seen anybody be lucky in a long time.

172
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,970
病菌容易近距离传播
Bugs like to run through close quarters.

173
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,200
不要离他再近了
Doesn't get any closer than this.

174
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,210
我们在这里  已接触了病菌
All of us in here, we've all been exposed.

175
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,720
爸爸
Dad?

176
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,120
我们得去找S医生
We have to go get Dr. S.

177
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,470
亲爱的  他被咬了
Honey, he's been bit.

178
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,940
医生也帮不了他
The doctor won't help.

179
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,990
你要照顾好你妹妹
You take care of your sister.

180
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,360
爸爸
Dad.

181
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,800
爸爸
Dad?

182
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,660
-爸爸  -不要
- Dad? - No.

183
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,740
-走吧  时候到了  -不要
- Come on, it's time. - No.

184
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,330
你们知道我要怎么做
You know what I have to do.

185
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,140
这是惯例
What we're always supposed to do.

186
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,770
你们可以在外面等
You can wait outside if you want.

187
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,910
好吗
Okay?

188
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,280
应该由我们来做
We should be the ones.

189
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,390
不  我做不到
No. I can't.

190
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,570
丽兹  你确定吗
Lizzie, are you sure?

191
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,760
你教过我们
You taught us.

192
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,280
我能做到的
I can do it.

193
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,430
好吧  但是你现在就得动手了
Okay, well, you have to do it now.

194
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,390
你立刻就得动手
You need to do it right now

195
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,060
得赶在他尸变前
because you have to do it before he turns.

196
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,370
我就待在这儿
I'm gonna stay right here.

197
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,460
你记得我怎么教你们的吗
You remember what I showed you?

198
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,990
丽兹  丽兹  丽兹
Lizzie. Lizzie, Lizzie.

199
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,680
没事的  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

200
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,350
丽兹  丽兹  没事了  深呼吸
Lizzie? Lizzie, it's okay. Breathe.

201
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,500
看着那些花
Look at the flowers.

202
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,840
和我一起数  一  二  三
Count one, two, three with me.

203
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,410
-一  二  -爸爸  不要啊
- One, two-- - Daddy, no!

204
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,830
别看  丽兹  看着这些花
No, Lizzie, look at the flowers.

205
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,460
和我数  一  二  三
Count one, two, three with me.

206
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,970
一  二  三
One, two, three.

207
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,180
看着这些花  丽兹
Look at the flowers, Lizzie.

208
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,670
-不要  -看着这些花
- No! - Look at the flowers!

209
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,960
区

210
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,460
先别靠近我
Hey, you might want to stay back.

211
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,020
-卡尔  -爸爸  对不起
- Carl. - Dad, I'm sorry.

212
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,310
我没看见你出来
I didn't see you come out.

213
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,710
没事了  我出来了
It's okay. I'm here.

214
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,480
我没事  离远点
I'm fine. Back away.

215
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,430
我不得已用了一支大门边上的枪
I had to use one of the guns by the gate.

216
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,900
我发誓我不想的
I swear I didn't want to.

217
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,940
我往回走的时候摔倒了
I was coming back. I fell.

218
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,040
他们跑出来救了我
They came out and helped me.

219
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,220
你没事吧
Are you all right?

220
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,990
里面发生了什么
What happened in there?

221
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,630
帕特里克昨晚生病了
Patrick got sick last night.

222
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,040
是某种流感  发作得很急
It's some kind of flu. It moves fast.

223
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,550
我们认为是他死了  然后攻击了牢房
We think he died and attacked the cell block.

224
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,930
我知道他是你的朋友  我很抱歉
Look, I know he was your friend and I'm sorry.

225
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,320
他是个好孩子
He was a good kid.

226
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,810
我们失去了很多好人
We lost a lot of good people.

227
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,180
格伦和你爸爸都没事
Glenn and your dad are okay,

228
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,800
但是他们之前都在里面
but they were in there.

229
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,550
你不应该离任何可能被感染的人太近
You shouldn't get too close to anyone that might have been exposed,

230
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,260
至少一段时间内不要
at least for a little while.

231
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,140
卡尔  你们三个都是
Carl. All of you.

232
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,600
帕特里克昨天还好好的
Patrick was fine yesterday,

233
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,820
隔夜就死了
and he died overnight.

234
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,090
两个人死的那么快
Two people died that quick?

235
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,960
我们得把所有接触过的人隔离
We'll have to separate everyone that's been exposed.

236
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,000
那就是刚进牢房区的所有人了
That's everyone in that cell block.

237
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,000
我们所有人  也许更多
That's all of us. Maybe more.

238
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,310
我们知道这种疾病可能致命
We know that this sickness can be lethal.

239
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,850
但我们不知道它的传染性有多强
We don't know how easily it spreads.

240
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,380
还有其他人表现出我们知道的症状吗
Is anyone else showing symptoms that we know of?

241
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,340
我们不能干等着  还有孩子呢
We can't just wait and see. There's children.

242
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,200
不仅仅是疾病的问题
It isn't just the illness.

243
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,070
人一死还会成为威胁
If people die, they become a threat.

244
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,190
我们需要给他们找个地方
We need a place for them to go.

245
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,400
他们不能待在D区
They can't stay in D.

246
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,830
我们不能冒险进去清扫
We can't risk going in there to clean it up.

247
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,330
我们可以用A区
We can use cell block A.

248
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,570
死囚区吗
Death row?

249
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,260
我可不觉得那里更好
I'm not sure that's much of an upgrade.

250
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,960
那里很干净  所以更好
It's clean. That's an upgrade.

251
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,440
S医生应该没问题吧
Think that'll work for Dr. S?

252
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,560
我可以帮迦勒一起整理
I'll help Caleb get it set up.

253
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,930
-你还好吗  -没事
- You okay? - Mm-hmm.

254
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,600
你确定吗  听起来可不怎么好
You sure? You don't sound so good.

255
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,300
我带她去我的房间  让她休息一下
We're just taking her back to my cell so she can rest.

256
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,600
泰尔西  那不是好主意
Tyreese, I don't think that's a good idea.

257
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,350
为什么  这是怎么了
Why? What's going on now?

258
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,590
我们觉得可能是流感之类的
We think it's a flu or something.

259
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,380
帕特里克就那么死的
That's how Patrick died.

260
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,750
朱迪思在那个牢房区
Judith was in that cell block.

261
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,070
她很脆弱
She's vulnerable.

262
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,350
任何可能已经病了
Anyone that may be sick

263
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,590
或者可能被感染的人都应该离远点
or even exposed should stay away.

264
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,830
-帕特里克死于这个病吗  -她会没事的
- It killed Patrick? - She's gonna be okay.

265
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,070
既然我们知道帕特里克的死因
Now that we know what Patrick died from

266
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,590
那我们就有办法解决  对吗
we can treat it, right?

267
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,890
别慌  我们会搞清楚的
Don't panic. We're going to figure this out.

268
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,700

凯伦和大卫在情况好转前都先隔离

我知道  很遗憾

但如果你想活下去  就得坚强起来

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,250
他死了  他是我爸爸可他现在死了
He's dead.He was special and now he's dead.

303
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,870
他们为什么要杀他  为什么要杀尼克
Why'd they kill him? Why'd they kill Nick?

304
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,580
你太傻了

尼克
Nick?

306
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,350

这一次你经受住了考验
All this time you've been taking off,

这是大家共同的努力
It was all of us.

你要再带我们挺过这一回吗
You gonna help us figure this out?

317
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,420
我搞砸了太多次
I screwed up too many times.

318
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,920
你不得不替我照应  而我沉湎于悲痛
Those calls you got to make, I start down that road...

319
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,390
我差点害我儿子性情大变
I almost lost my boy-- who he was.

320
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,890
如果有别的需要  我可以挺身而出
Whatever else this place needs, I'm here for it.

321
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,390
我说过了  你经受住了考验
Like I said, you earned it.

322
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,270
无论如何  你能看出问题
But for what it's worth, you see mistakes.

323
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,960
麻烦来的时候
I see when the shit hits,

324
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,390
你也能拿着铁锹守在那儿
you're standing there with a shovel.

325
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,140
瑞克  达里尔
Rick! Daryl!

326
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,680

声响太大把它们都引来了  这儿快不行了
The noise drew 'em out and now this part's starting to give.

328
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,450
你看到什么了吗
Did you see anything?

329
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,920
他们开始把死人搬出来
They just started taking out the dead.

330
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,000
我不知道谁死了
I don't need to know who yet.

331
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,990
我也不想知道
I don't want to.

332
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,810
很高兴你安全回来
I'm glad you came back safe.

333
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,250
太傻了
It was stupid.

334
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,500
我太傻了
I was so stupid.

335
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,700
我摔倒的时候  他们就该抛下我不管
When I fell on my ass, they should have just left me out there.

336
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,610
这是傻话
Now that's stupid.

337
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,590
我们在乎你
We care about you.

338
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,870
他们可能会受伤
They could have gotten hurt.

339
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,380
你在乎一个人时
When you care about people

340
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,170
受伤是在所难免的
hurt is kind of part of the package.

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,350
有孩子吗
Were there any kids?

342

寡妇和孤儿都有称呼
Got all these widows and orphans,

343
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,970
但要怎么称呼失去孩子的人
but what do you call someone who lost a child?

344
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,460
会有人给那类人起名字吗
You'd think someone would have given that a name.

345
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,870
你还好吗
Are you okay?

346
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,660
她常那样哭吗
Does she always cry like that?

347
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,710
我觉得她能感知人们的情绪
I think she senses people's moods.

348
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,430
别
Don't.

349
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,550
我们应该远离彼此
We're supposed to stay away from each other.

350
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,780
你们看到这个了吗
Are you seeing this?

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,490
有人在喂行尸吗
Is someone feeding these things?

-当心  -快顶住这边的栅栏

等等  等等
Hold on, hold on.

354
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,020
快倒了  快倒了
It's gonna give! It's gonna give!

355
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,930
所有人退后  快点  退后
Everybody back! Come on, back, now.

356
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,840
栅栏继续往里凹陷的话
Fence keeps bending in like that,

357
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,710
行尸会闯进来的
those walkers are coming over it.

358
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,440
达里尔  把车开过来
Daryl, get the truck.

359
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,690
我知道该怎么办
I know what to do.

360
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,940
帕特里克是不是天主教徒
You know if Patrick was Catholic?

361
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,860
他说他是无神论者
He said he was a practicing atheist.

362
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,230
你告诉你爸昨天图书馆的事了吗

没
Nope.

你懂的
You know that.

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,220
你告诉他们父母了吗
Did you tell their parents?

368

没有

369
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,370
你会告诉他们吗
Are you gonna tell them?

370
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,690
如果我说了  这事过后他们也许会理解
If I do, maybe after this they'll understand.

371
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,200
但他们也许不会  我不想这个冒险
But maybe they won't. I don't want to take that risk.

372
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,400
那是你们之间的问题
That's between you and them.

373
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
不
No.

374
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,080
这是我们之间的问题
It's between you and me.

375

如果你告诉你爸  他就会告诉家长
If you tell your dad, he'll tell them.

376
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,250
如我所说  他们也许会理解  也许不会
And like I said, maybe they'll understand, maybe they won't.

377
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,030
我不想对我爸撒谎
I don't want to lie to my dad.

I'm not asking you to lie.

379
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,650

386
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,990
? Makes me wish that I could be a dog ?
? 宁为犬  勿为人 ?

387
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,700
? When I see the price that you pay ?

388
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,490
? I don't wanna grow up ?
? 我不愿长大 ?

389
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,160
? Nothin' ever seems to go that way ?

我给她唱我喜欢的歌
I just sing her what I like.

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,540
总比给她唱
Figure it's better than ashes

395
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,780
吓人的歌谣要好些

你觉得是猪感染了他们吗
Think the pigs made them sick?

413
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,940
也许是我们感染了猪
Or we made the pigs sick.

414
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,480
我们应该离朱迪远点
I think we should stay away from Judy a while.
