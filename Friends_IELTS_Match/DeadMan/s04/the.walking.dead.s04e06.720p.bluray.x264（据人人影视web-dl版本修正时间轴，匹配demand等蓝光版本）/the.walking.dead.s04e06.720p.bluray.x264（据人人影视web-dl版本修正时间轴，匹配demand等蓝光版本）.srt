1
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,180
? In my hands I hold the ashes ?

2
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,110
? In my veins black pitch runs ?

3
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,850
? In my chest the fire catches ?

4
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,440
? In my way a setting sun ?

5
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,900
? Dark clouds gather round me ?

6
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,370
? To the West my soul is bound ?

7
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,610
? But I will go on ahead free ?

8
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,090
? There is a light yet to be found ?

9
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,750
? The last pale light in the west ?

10
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,630
我已在路上漂泊了几个月
I've been on the road for a couple of months.

11
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,120
你一个人吗
By yourself?

12
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,450
是啊
Yeah.

13
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,560
之前你住在哪里
Where did you live before that?

14
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,580
一座小镇上
I was in a town.

15
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,770
那里有这些怪物吗
Were the monsters there?

16
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,880
没有
No.

17
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,990
那里很安全
It was safe.

18
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,410
别回家
布莱恩・赫里奥特
去吉姆家过冬

19
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,260
都是好人
Full of good people.

20
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,970
查德・克里尔死亡
梅根・库克死亡
我们找到了肯・琼斯
凯西・布鲁尔
去死吧  莫丽卡  不准回家[右上]

21
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,560
出什么事了
What happened?

22
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,120
布莱恩・赫里奥特  我们在家[划掉]
来找我们[划掉]  我们爱你
别回家  布莱恩・赫里奥特

23
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,970
他发疯了
He just lost it.

24
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,610
谁
Who?

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,150
掌管大权的人
The man in charge.

26
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,100
我差点死在那里
I barely got out alive.

27
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,850
? And I ask for no redemption ?

28
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,240
? In this cold and barron place ?

29
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:49,060
? Still I see the faint reflection ?

30
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,700
? And so by it, I got my way ?

31
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,190
? The last pale light in the west ?

32
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,530

You look like you barely got out alive.

42

-塔拉  -我是说
- Tara. - I mean...

43
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
我们有点精神紧张
We're a little on edge.

44
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,610
我们一直躲在这里
We've been holed up in here

45
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,150
等着国民警卫队  自从...
waiting for the National Guard since--

46
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,110
-他妈的一切大乱开始  -注意用词
- The shit hit the fan. - Language.

47
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,360
自从一切大乱开始
Since the crap hit the fan.

48
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,870
的确如此
Which it did

49
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,500
然后就蔓延到了整个区域
right before it got flung all over the damn place.

50
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,940
你打算待在大楼里吗
Are you planning on staying in the building?

51
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,050
你到底打不打算留下来
Are you planning on staying or not?

52
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
-该死  这是个哑巴  -塔拉

53
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,720
我妹问了你一个问题
My sister asked you a question.

54
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,530
只过一晚
Just for the night.

55
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,560
你看见这个了吗
You see this?

56
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,160
这是一把装满子弹的标配史密斯威森手枪
This here is a fully loaded, standard issue Smith & Wesson.

57
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,250
我是亚特兰大警察
I'm Atlanta City Police

58
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,700
这里有足够的枪支弹药  可以在接下来十年里
and I have enough artillery in here to kill you

59
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,830
每天杀死你一次
every day for the next 10 years.

60
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,690
你要是敢耍我或者我家人
You mess with me or my family,

61
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,130
我向耶稣发誓  我会干掉你的
and I swear to Christ, I will put you down.

62
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,110
懂吗
Got it?

63
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,290
懂了
Got it.

64
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,910
那我们就没事了
Then we're cool.

65
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,190
来击拳吧
Pound it.

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,850
给  哥们
Here, bro.

67
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,970
在你走之前  这个我们得留着
We'll hold onto this until you go.

68
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,740
是的
Yeah.

69
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,120

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,220
布莱恩

71
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,130
布莱恩・赫里奥特
Brian Heriot.

72
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,190
你肯定饿了
You got to be hungry.

73
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,930
里面没什么更好的东西了
You're not gonna find anything better in there.

74
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,340
自从威尔海姆小姐去了佛罗里达
Tara ransacked the place

75
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,440
塔拉就将那里洗劫一空
after Miss Wilhelm took off for Florida.

76
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,850
威尔海姆小姐最爱吃棉豆
Big fan of butter beans, Miss Wilhelm.

77
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,470
谢谢
Thank you.

79
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,730
来吧  孩子  看看你的牌
Come on, kiddo. Show me what you got here.

80
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,230
一切还好吗
Everything okay?

81
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,560
她又开始不吃饭了
She didn't eat again.

82
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,640
她爱吃腌牛肉  试试那个
She likes the corned beef. Try that.

83
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,540
最后两罐我是留给老爸的
I'm saving the last two cans for Dad.

84
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,560
她不是挑食  只是害怕而已
She's not picky, she's terrified.

85
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,460
伙计  您悠着点可以吗
Why don't you slow down, buddy, all right?

86
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,890
这里又不是假日酒店
This ain't the Holiday Inn.

87
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,420
左侧的木桶是洗涤用水
Bucket on the left is for washing,

88
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,840
右侧是清水
right is for rinsing.

89
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,460
塔拉
Tara.

90
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,130
抱歉
Sorry.

91
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,500
你够吃吗
You get enough to eat?

92
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,740
我给你倒点咖啡
I'll get you some coffee.

93
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,120
坐吧
Sit down.

94
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,820
去那儿坐着
Right there. Go on.

95
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,450
再掷一次
Go ahead, roll again.

96
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,640
嘿  过来啊
Hey, come here.

97
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,250
你有香烟吗
You got a cigarette?

98
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,160
老爸  你的氧气筒
Dad, your oxygen tank.

99
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,090
你没看见警告标志吗
Do you not see that red sticker?

100
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,880
我们千辛万苦才活到现在
I'll be damned if a Merit Ultra Menthol is gonna blow this place up

101
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,660
可不能因为你抽烟而把这地方炸掉
after all the work we've done to stay alive up here. Okay?

102
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,540
无所谓了  莉莉
It's all the same, Lily.

103
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,130
你能别这样说了吗
You can stop that talk right there.

104
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
不就是讨根烟吗
It's just a cigarette.

105
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,590
请自便
Help yourself.

106
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,110
我们的肉干够吃好几天
We got roni sticks for days.

107
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,330
说不定能撑几年
Years, probably.

108
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,150
看见外面停的大货车了吗
You see that big truck parked outside?

109
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,530
就是那辆戈贝利食品货车
Come on, dude, the Gorbelli food truck.

110
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,590
雷・查尔斯都可以看见[盲人歌手]
Ray Charles could have seen it.

111
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,670
是啊
Yeah.

112
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,640
老爸给他们开车
Dad drove for them.

113
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,930
即便是还背着氧气瓶
Even with the tank.

114
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,080
他们当时关闭了75号公路
The day they closed down the 75--

115
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,160
从"他-妈-的"天下大乱开始
When the S-H-I-T hit the fan.

116
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,300
他从学校接了梅根  到医院接了我
He grabbed Megan from school, picked me up at the hospital--

117
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,190
她还从医院里偷了几个氧气瓶
She stole a bunch of oxygen tanks from that dump.

118
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,140
接着我们仨一起去接塔拉
Then the three of us rushed over to get Tara.

119
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,070
我当时在警局上班  登记犯人
I was at the station working, booking.

120
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,730
那时一片混乱
With everything going on,

121
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,180
行尸袭来  军队进驻亚特兰大
the attacks, the Army going into Atlanta,

122
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
他一直让我们和他寸步不离
he wasn't about to let us out of his sight.

123
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,030
还好我们走运  老爸的货车里囤满了
Lucky for us, the old man's truck was pretty much stocked

124
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,040
堆到天花板的意面圈
floor to ceiling with sketti rings,

125
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,660
火鸡辣酱汤  还有这些零食
turkey chili, and these little suckers.

126
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,930
小梅  爷爷得休息一下了  好吗
Meggie, Granddad needs a break, okay?

127
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,150
-莉莉  -来了  爸爸
- Lily. - Sure, Daddy.

128
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,890
数到三
On three.

129
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,640
大个子  过来搭把手吧
A little help here, big guy.

130
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,760
来
Here.

131
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,620
好吧  叫的不是你
Oh, right. No, not you.

132
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,330
是屋里的另外一个大个子
The other big guy in the room.

133
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,090
塔拉
Tara.

134
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,310
行了
Okay.

135
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,590
数到三
On three.

136
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,040
好的  一  二
Okay, one, two--

137
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,500
这里
Here. Here.

138
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,030
听到那些东西了么
You hear them?

139
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,090
听到了
Yeah.

140
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,430
能抬一下我的腿吗  朋友
Get my legs, friend?

141
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,230
塔拉上去了好几次
Tara's been up there a bunch of times

142
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,770
把那些混球轰成碎片
blasting them bastards to pieces.

143
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,660
她说那些东西怎么也打不死
She says they just keep getting back up.

144
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,460
我告诉她别再上去了
I told her no more.

145
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,220
不能让她继续浪费子弹了
Can't afford to waste her bullets.

146
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,080
你有小孩吗
You got kids?

147
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,980
没有
No.

148
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,030
我的女儿们出生的时候
When my girls were born,

149
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,630
我终于明白了成为一个男人意味着什么
that's when I finally figured out what it was to be a man.

150
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,770
你懂的  一个真男人
You know, a real man.

151
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,320
你保护她们  保证她们安全
You protect them, you keep them safe.

152
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,170
你花尽心思让她们变得更强
You just try to make them stronger

153
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,740
直到她们能照顾自己
until they can look out for themselves.

154
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,990
但这种情况
But... this here,

155
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,750
我从未想过她们会遇上这种事
I-- I never counted on this.

156
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,650
我有个伙计
Hey, I got a buddy.

157
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,120
比尔・詹金斯  他住在303
Bill Jenkins, he lives up in 303.

158
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,790
他那儿有套很棒的双陆棋
He's got a real nice backgammon set up there.

159
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,670
他不会介意的  他把棋放在床底下
He won't mind and he keeps it under his bed there.

160
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,980
拜托了
Just... please.

161
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,720
你在外面生活过
You've been out there in the world

162
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,560
你知道在那些东西周围如何自卫
and you know how to handle yourself around those things.

163
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,690
听着  我知道你也许不理解
Look, I know you might not understand it

164
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,250
因为你没有女儿
'cause you don't got a baby girl of your own,

165
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,030
但是
but...

166
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,380
这东西也许能让我的梅根重新开始说话
it might be something that might make my Megan talk again.

167
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,490
拜托了
Please.

168
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,350
谢谢你
Thank you.

169
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,450
不客气
You're welcome.

170
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,960
一切都会过去[枕头上的文字]

171
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,790
给你上路带的东西
Couple things for the road.

172
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,280
我自己可以
I'm okay.

173
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,010
你帮了我们
You helped us.

174
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,120
这是我们的谢意
We're saying thank you.

175
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,040
你自己看着办吧
Deal with it.

176
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,920
我估计你需要这个
I guess you'll be needing this back.

177
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,660
你留着吧
Keep it.

178
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,930
别
Don't...

179
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,940
用那玩意儿扔我
throw that at me.

180
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,540
这是你的枪
It's your gun.

181
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,850
你可以拿回去
You can have it back.

182
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,600
你也需要一把
You need another one.

183
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,690
我有这个了
I have this.

184
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,580
塔拉说的没错
Tara was right.

185
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,250
我们应该搜你的身
We should have frisked you.

186
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,440
我在楼上发现的
I found it upstairs.

187
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,090
你留着那把吧
You keep that.

188
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,830
你们要命中脑袋才行
You have to kill the brain.

189
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,950
什么
What?

190
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,740
你姐姐冲着它们的身体射击
Your sister, she shot 'em in the body,

191
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,010
但你们得射这里
but you have to hit 'em here.

192
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,450
这样才能杀死它们
That's what kills them.

193
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,390
为什么
Why?

194
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,560
我有些事情得求你
I need to ask you something.

195
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,140
我爸的肺癌已经到晚期了
My dad's got stage four lung cancer.

196
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,500
我多年照顾肿瘤病人

197
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,840
能看出他快不行了
He's nearing the end.

198
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,470
他的氧气还剩两天的量
He's got about two days of oxygen.

199
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,390
也许更少
Maybe less.

200
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,840
我们从没想过他能挺这么久
We never thought he'd make it this long.

201
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,350
你已经为我们做了很多  但是...
You've already done so much for us, but...

202
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,200
几个街区之外
there's an old folks home

203
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,370
有一家老人院
a couple of blocks from here.

204
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,770
哪怕只有一罐也行
Even one tank would mean everything.

205
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,900
他是唯一能让梅根微笑的人
He's the only one who can put a smile on Megan's face.

206
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,180
哪怕只有一秒也好

207
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,810
这两个都是满的
They're both full.

208
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,050
你还好吗
Are you okay?

209
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,190
是的
Yeah.

210
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,330
你还没让我说谢谢呢
You didn't let me say thank you.

211
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,330
我没事
Yeah, I'm okay.

212
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,580
坐吧
Sit.

213
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,550
让我重操旧业护理你
Let me be a nurse again.

214
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,230
好消息是你不需要缝针
Good news is it doesn't look like you need any stitches.

215
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,640
坏消息是
Bad news...

216
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,850
这会像狂蜂蜇了一样疼
this is gonna sting like a couple of angry bees.

217
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,900
有事做的感觉真好
Feels good to have something to do.

218
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,420
从来没人说起过
Nobody ever mentioned just

219
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,160
世界末日竟然会这么无聊
how boring the end of the world was gonna be.

220
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
她以为你是她爸爸
She thought you were her dad.

221
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,860
梅根
Megan.

222
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,040
当她看见你在街上时

223
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,060
三年半前的一个晚上  他出了门
He went out one night about three and a half years ago

224
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,920
去买几瓶啤酒和强力球彩票
to get a couple beers and a Powerball ticket.

225
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,780
他说他很快就回来
Said he'd be right back.

226
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,780
梅根把你认成了他
Megan thought you were him,

227
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,760
以为你终于回家了
finally coming right back.

228
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,650
-妈妈  -在这里  亲爱的
- Mama. - In here, honey.

229
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,610
一切都很好  甜心
Everything's okay, sweetheart.

230
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,660
布莱恩受了点小伤  需要清理一下
Brian just got a boo-boo that needs a little cleaning up.

231
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,100
就跟你被割伤时一样
Same as when you get a cut.

232
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,650
我没拿药膏
I don't have the ointment.

233
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,550
我去拿药  你帮我看护一下病人吧
Why don't you watch my patient until I get back?

234
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,260
好的
Okay.

235
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,780
你眼睛怎么了
What happened to your eye?

236
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,220
没了
It's gone.

237
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,870
出了什么事吗
Something happen to you

238
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,680
还是你一生下来就这样
or were you just born like that?

239
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,570
出了事
Something happened to me.

240
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,510
我是不是不该问
Was that bad to ask?

241
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
没事
No.

242
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,030
我会告诉你我的眼睛怎么了
I'll tell you what happened to my eye,

243
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,670
但你得发誓保守秘密
but you have to promise to keep it secret.

244
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,180
我发誓
I promise.

245
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,090
那是什么意思
What's that?

246
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,010
拉钩上吊不许变
Pinkie swear.

247
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,220
发誓保密  否则不得好死
Plus cross my heart and hope to die.

248
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,620
好吧
Well...

249
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,030
我是个海盗
I'm a pirate.

250
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,030
不可能
No way.

251
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,940
被你识破了
Yeah, you caught me.

252
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,450
其实是我救人的时候出了事
What really happened was I was trying to help someone.

253
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,040
为了救我深爱的人
Someone I loved very much.

254
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,520
你怎么帮助他们的
How were you trying to help them?

255
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,160
我想尽力保护他们
I was trying to protect them, you know?

256
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,790
不让他们受伤
Stop them getting hurt.

257
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,130
但你自己却受伤了
But you got hurt instead.

258
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,340
是啊
Yeah.

259
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,890
他们也受伤了吗
Did they get hurt, too?

260
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,920
是啊  也受伤了
Yeah, yeah, they did.

261
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,670
我真遗憾
I'm sorry.

262
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,330
我也是
Me, too.

263
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,440
这是什么
What is it?

264
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,210
国际象棋
Chess.

265
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,110
看起来好难
Looks hard.

266
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,490
对有些人来说可能会难  但你很聪明
Well, maybe for some folks, but you're smart.

267
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,050
你很快就能学会
You'll catch on quick.

268
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,760
这个棋子叫什么
What's this one called?

269
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,580
那是卒
That's a pawn.

270
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,440
他们是你的士兵
They're your soldiers.

271
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,770
他们会死吗
Do they die?

272
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,880
有时会
Sometimes.

273
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,430
如果他们都死了  你就输了吗
Do you lose if they die?

274
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,100
不  不一定
No, not necessarily.

275
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,400
就算你折损了很多小卒
You can lose a lot of soldiers,

276
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,040
还是可以翻盘
but still win the game.

277
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,850
那是国王
That's the king.

278
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,290
你要想办法俘获他
That's the guy you want to capture.

279
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,680
你在干什么
What are you doing?

280
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,080
你等着瞧吧
You'll see.

281
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,250
像你
Looks like you.

282
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,770
是啊
Yeah.

283
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,640
好了  来下棋吧
Come on, let's play.

284
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,280
这些是卒
So these ones are pawns.

285
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,280
他去世了
He's gone.

286
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,300
我想他去世有一会儿了
I think he's been gone a while.

287
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,950
你们应该离开这里
Y'all should go now.

288
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,790
给我们点时间
Just give us a minute.

289
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,140
我爱你  爸爸
I love you, Daddy.

290
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,870
塔拉
Tara!

291
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,800
-住手  你在干什么  -那不是爸爸
- Stop! What are you doing? - It's not Dad!

292
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,530
-快住手  -它不是爸爸
- Stop! - It's not Dad!

293
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,590
我懂  好吗
I know, okay?

294
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,030
这种事迟早会发生
It happens no matter what?

295
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,280
是的
Yeah.

296
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,380
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

297
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,550
他也许会咬到我
He could have got me.

298
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,910
差点就咬到我了
He almost got me.

299
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,990
我在想
I was thinking

300
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,190
如果他还在  一定会很感激你
he would have been grateful or whatever

301
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,060
及时制止了他
that you stopped him, from him--

302
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,390
你懂我的意思吗
you know what I mean?

303
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,200
所以  我们没闹翻
So, yeah, we're cool.

304
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,440
再见
Good-bye.

305
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,390
不
No.

306
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,490
-我们要跟你一起去  -不行
- We're coming with you. - No.

307
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,870
肯定有更安全的地方
There has to be someplace better,

308
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,210
你要帮我们找到
and you're gonna help us find it.

309
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,350
-莉莉  -我看到照片了  布莱恩
- Lily. - I saw the picture, Brian.

310
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,170
你曾有家人  我知道
You had a family, I know that.

311
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,970
我也知道我们不是她们
And I know we're not them.

312
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,640
但就现在来说  你必须跟我们在一起
But for now, you're stuck with us.

313
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,590
-只有这一个办法  -我不能这样
- And that's just the way it's gonna be. - I can't.

314
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,970
你已经这样了
You already have.

315
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,100
我们该去哪儿
Where should we go?

316
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,840
计划赶不上变化
No use making a plan.

317
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,880
我们只能看着它们走
We'll go where they let us.

318
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,930
它们是谁
Who's they?

319
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
道路
The roads.

320
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,110
行尸
The biters.

321
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,510
我其实不算是警察
I'm not really a cop.

322
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,550
但也不全是谎话
I mean, it's not a total lie.

323
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,910
我是警校学生
I was in the academy.

324
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,960
抱歉对你说谎了
I'm sorry I lied to you.

325
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,690
你不必感到抱歉
You don't have to be sorry.

326
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,420
我确实很抱歉
Well, I am.

327
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,810
你觉得我们能活下去吗
Do you think we can make it?

328
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,190
我们能的
We'll make it.

329
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,960
你在骗我吗
Are you lying to me?

330
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,500
没有
No.

331
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,580
你可以过来  梅根
You can come join us, Megan.

332
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,330
过段时间就好了
It's just gonna take some time.

333
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,750
没事
It's okay.

334
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,530
我们很快就能找到车
We'll find another car soon.

335
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,250
但愿你是对的
I hope you're right.

336
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,800
这乡村景色总是让我想起萨姆
This whole country backdrop is reminding me of Sam.

337
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,110
-又来了  -我以为她是我的真命天女
- Here we go. - I thought she was the one.

338
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,860
然后你们去野营  吃了致幻蘑菇  全完了
Then you went camping, ate mushrooms, game over.

339
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,940
你忘记了
You're forgetting the part where

340
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,950
萨姆崩溃了  然后告诉我她有男朋友
Sam broke down and told me she had a boyfriend,

341
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,020
她其实不喜欢妹子
that she wasn't really into chicks.

342
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,270
那是我一生中最糟糕的周末
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.

343
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,120
塔拉
Tara.

344
