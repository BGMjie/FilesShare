00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,770
而他觉得我超级搞笑
and he happened to find me extremely funny.

117
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,430
我们需要食物  电池  水
We need food, batteries, water,

118
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,740
分清主次
in that order.

119
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,720
为什么你从没告诉过我你有过孩子
Why didn't you ever tell me you had a kid?

120
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,460
他叫什么
What was his name?

121
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,960
你有其他孩子吗
Did you have any others?

122
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,250
你结过婚吗
Were you married?

123
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,980
好吧
Okay.

124
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,200
我每次只回答一个问题
I'll answer one question at a time,

125
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,610
每进一个房间回答一次
one room at a time,

126
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,440
而且必须在我们确认屋内安全之后
and only after we've cleared it.

127
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,120
-不要  对不起  -你是个撒谎的懦夫
- No, I'm sorry. - You're a lying coward.

128
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,210
你不会变的
That's all you'll ever be.

129
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,790
不  求你了  我很抱歉
No, please, I'm sorry.

130
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,350
别这么做  求你了
Don't do this, please.

131
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,070
你他妈对我说什么了
What the hell'd you say to me?

132
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,900
-我说别这么做  -这不关你的事
- I said don't do this. - This ain't your business.

133
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,490
-我很抱歉  伙计  -你闭嘴吧
- I'm sorry, man. -Aw, shut up.

134
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,890
我真的很抱歉  不  不要
I'm so sorry. No, don't.

135
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,790
我会动手的
It's gonna happen.

136
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,140
我们能和好的  求你了
We can work this out. Please,

137
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,900
-别这么做  -我不会停手
- Don't do this. - It's gonna happen.

138
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,180
不  不  不要  求你了
No, no, no, please.

139
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,700
拜托不要  求你了
Please don't. Please!

140
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,830
-你会搞定他吗  -是的
- You plan on finishing the job? - Yeah.

141
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,430
我耳朵都要聋了
I'm getting an earache

142
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,640
我就知道他会让他惨叫
and I know he's just gonna let his ass squeal.

143
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,260
就凭他做过的事  这男的活该流血
After what he did, the man deserves to bleed.

144
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,990
你们想的话就都留在下面
Y'all stay down there if you want.

145
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,090
我们今晚就住这儿了
This will be our abode for the evening.

146
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,830
把你的烂摊子收拾干净  哈利
Clean up your mess, Harley.

147
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,870
你儿子叫什么
What was your son's name?

148
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,310
我说了检查后再说
I said after.

149
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,060
这其实是两间分开的房间
Well, these are actually two separate rooms

150
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,870
而我们已经检查了那间  所以
and we already cleared that one, so...

151
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,500
安德烈
Andre.

152
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,380
他叫安德烈・安东尼
His name was Andre Anthony.

153
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,000
你去看看那儿有没有藏着饼干
Make sure there isn't a box of cookies hiding in there.

154
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,730
你还有其他孩子吗
Did you have any other kids?

155
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,100
朋友  注意游戏规则
Rules of the game, my friend.

156
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,740
所以呢
So?

157
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,600
你有吗
Did you?

158
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,070
你知道吗  你真适合当间谍
You know, you could be a spy.

159
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,070
或者是警察
Or a cop.

160
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,230
没有
No.

161
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,860
一个孩子对我而言就够了
One was enough for me.

162
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,800
安德烈就是个小麻烦  像你一样
And Andre was a handful, like you.

163
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,930
这个走廊算一个房间吗
Does this hallway count as a room?

164
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
假如你能在这里找到物资就算
If you can find something we can use.

165
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,210
我只找到这个
This is the only thing I could find.

166
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,580
这算吗
Does it count?

167
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,810
理论上算
Technically, yes.

168
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,730
那么
So?

169
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,890
过去多久了
How long has it been?

170
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,100
那事发生在...
It happened after--

171
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,340
发生在灾变之后
you know, after everything happened.

172
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,690
我爸爸知道吗
Does my dad know?

173
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,680
我从没告诉过他
Never told him.

174
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,250
在刚刚告诉你之前
Never told anyone

175
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,360
我从没告诉过任何人
till just now.

176
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,100
我会为你保密
Your secret is safe with me.

177
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,150
其实也不算什么秘密
It's not really a secret.

178
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,880
我还是会保密
It's still safe with me.

179
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,250
别打扰  梅梅在睡觉

180
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,820
梅梅

181
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,780
米琼恩
Michonne?

182
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,170
没事吧
Everything okay?

183
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,900
没事
Yeah, it's fine.

184
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,960
那里有孩子吗
There's a baby in there.

185
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,860
是条狗
It's a dog.

186
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,440
我爸让我给她取名字
My dad let me name her.

187
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,000
也许
Maybe--

188
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,940
也许她跟安德烈在同一个地方
maybe her and Andre are together somewhere.

189
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,030
走吧
Come on.

190
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,600
快中午了
It's almost noon.

191
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,600
要是晚了  你爸爸会担心的
Your dad will wonder where we are if we're late.

192
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,970
喂
Yo.

193
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,440
舒服吗
Comfy?

194
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,790
你把我弄醒就为了问我舒不舒服吗
You waking me up to see if I'm comfortable?

195
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,930
我想躺会儿
I want to lie down.

196
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,390
这层还有两个卧室呢
Two other bedrooms up here to choose.

197
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,050
那是小孩的床
Them's kids' beds.

198
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,580
我要这张
I want this one.

199
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,690
-已经被我占了  -我可不管
- It's claimed. - I didn't hear it.

200
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,470
你换个地方去占吧
You gonna have to lay claim somewhere else.

201
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,810
伦
Len!

202
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,050
伦  住手
Len, stop!

203
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,140
伦  住手
Stop, Len!

204
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,520
-住手  -休想
- Stop! - Hell, no.

205
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,930
住手
Stop!

206
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,000
床归我了  混蛋
My bed now, jackoff.

207
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,940
别动
Hey, don't move.

208
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,740
喝点水
Here's some water.

209
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,770
我们在哪儿
Where are we?

210
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,410
我不知道
I don't know.

211
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,870
一离开监狱我们就跟行尸干上了
We were fighting biters and you passed out

212
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,450
然后你晕倒了
right after we left the prison.

213
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,160
我不知道怎么办
I didn't know what to do.

214
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,780
坐在卡车后面似乎比走路更安全
The back of the truck seemed safer than the side of the road.

215
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,110
路上有大巴吗
Did we pass a bus?

216
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,330
我们有没有路过一辆大巴
On the road, did we pass a bus?

217
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,890
有
Yeah.

218
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,970
你看到什么了
What did you see?

219
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,810
你看到什么了
What did you see?

220
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,990
他们都死了
They were all dead.

221
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,730
我们路过多久了
How long since we passed it?

222
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,660
三小时
Three hours.

223
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,820
停车
Hey, stop the truck.

224
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,250
该死的  快停车
Hey, numbnuts, stop the truck.

225
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,610
快停车
Stop the truck!

226
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,980
快停车
Stop the truck!

227
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,280
你要去哪儿
Where the hell are you going?

228
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,000
他要去哪儿
Where the hell is he going?

229
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,150
我不知道你的女伙伴有没有告诉你
I don't know what your lady friend's told you

230
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,710
我们这次任务的特殊性
about the special nature of the mission we're on,

231
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,210
但我们赶时间
but this shit is time-sensitive

232
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,860
而且已经比计划晚了
and we're already way behind schedule.

233
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,450
所以你马上转身给我回车上去
So I need you to turn your ass around and get back in the truck.

234
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,450
-我必须得走  -你们俩好像
- I gotta go. - It seems like neither one of you's

235
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,780
完全不了解
been paying close enough attention

236
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,610
我们现在的糟糕处境
to the hell on earth we've been living in.

237
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,030
那我就告诉你怎么才能避免
So let me tell you how to best avoid

238
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,290
变成那种行尸走肉
winding up just another dead-alive prick.

239
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,590
找到强大而且志同道合的伙伴
You find some strong, like-minded comrades

240
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,380
然后不论发生什么  都待在一起
and you stay stuck together like wet on water.

241
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,370
我们需要人
We need people.

242
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,300
多多益善  我们相互依赖  伙计
The more the better. We need each other, partner.

243
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,470
即便有这么多装备  你也不可能撑过一晚
Even with all that gear on your shoulder, you won't last a night.

244
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,930
你自己肯定不行
Not by yourself.

245
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,040
我愿意冒险
I'll take my chances.

246
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,820
我必须坚持
I'm gonna have to insist

247
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,060
让你留下
that you hold the hell up.

248
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,240
不管你信不信
All right, believe it or not,

249
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,200
全人类的命运也许就取决于此了
the fate of the entire damn human race might depend on it.

250
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,740
你在说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

251
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,210
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

252
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,530
我是亚伯拉罕・福特中士
I'm Sergeant Abraham Ford.

253
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,230
他们是我的同伴
And these are my companions

254
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,870
罗西塔・埃斯皮诺萨和尤金・伯特博士
Rosita Espinosa and Dr. Eugene Porter.

255
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,690
我们的任务是把尤金送到华府
We're on a mission to get Eugene to Washington, DC.

256
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,080
尤金是科学家
Eugene's a scientist

257
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,420
他知道行尸遍地的真正原因
and he knows exactly what caused this mess.

258
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,220
好吧
All right.

259
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,640
怎么回事
So what happened?

260
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,170
这是机密
It's classified.

261
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,470
他一直在用卫星电话
He'd been talking to the muckety-mucks in Washington

262
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,000
和华盛顿高层保持联系
on his satellite phone.

263
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,880
但过去的几个星期里
The past couple weeks,

264
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,850
没有人接电话了
nobody's been picking up on the other end.

265
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,320
我们看到了你之前是如何对付行尸的
We saw how you handled those corpses back there.

266
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,460
我们需要你的帮助
We could use your help.

267
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,050
抱歉
Sorry.

268
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,850
之前我们不得不离开那条路
I had to get us off that road.

269
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,480
你晕过去了  我们也没有子弹了
You were passed out, we were out of bullets.

270
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,940
但是我知道怎么回到大巴那里
But I know how to get back to that bus.

271
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,330
我把每个转弯都记下来了
I wrote down every turn.

272
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,330
我会把你带回去的  我可以的  好吗
I will get you back, I can, okay?

273
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,050
她会去那找我
That's where she'd go to find me.

274
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,380
-我要去那  -那是浪费时间
- That's where I'm gonna go. - It's a waste of time.

275
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,820
塔拉告诉了我发生了什么
Tara told us what went down.

276
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,640
你找到你妻子的可能性为零
There is zero chance you will ever find your wife again.

277
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,170
不管是死是活
Alive or dead.

278
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,730
因为  抱歉这样说 
Mainly because, sorry to tell you,

279
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,350
她死了
she's gone.

280
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,120
你没必要也去送死
No need for you to die, too.

281
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,890
走吧
Now come on.

282
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,360
回车上去  做点有意义的事
Get back in the truck. Do something with your life.

283
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,550
当我们...
When the people we...

284
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,910
爱的人死...
we love kick...

285
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,130
当他们消失时
well, they disappear.

286
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,680
不意味着你也要跟着消失
Doesn't mean you've got to go out that way, too.

287
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,550
她还活着  我会找到她的
She's alive and I'm gonna find her.

288
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,660
狗娘养的
You son of a bitch!

289
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,010
-嘿  -亚伯拉罕
- Hey, hey, hey! - Abraham!

290
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,150
放开他
Hey, get off him.

291
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,220
住手
Come on.

292
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,050
别这样  亚伯拉罕
You don't want this, Abraham.

293
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,320
放开我
Let me go!

294
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,440
-亚伯拉罕  -住手
- Abraham! - Stop!

295
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,190
-住手  -亚伯拉罕
- Hey! - Abraham!

296
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,410
快住手
Hey, get--

297
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,150
别打了  过来
Hey, hey, hey! Come here!

298
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,200
住手
Stop!

299
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,900
尤金
Eugene!

300
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,640
别开枪  该死
Stop firing, damn it!

301
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,110
别开枪了  我们得去拿武器
Stop firing! We need to get our weapons.

302
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,750
别管他了
Leave 'em!

303
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,200
给我支枪
Hey, give me a gun.

304
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,620
给我支枪
Give me a gun.

305
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,190
妈蛋
Son of a dick.

306
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,970
托尼  伦  滚下来
Tony, Len, get your asses down here.

307
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,580
听见没有
Yo, you hear me?

308
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,330
快下来
Claim, Claim, Claim!

309
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,720
闭上臭嘴  我要睡觉
Shut the hell up. I'm trying to sleep.

310
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,560
有个女的住在这
There's a woman shacking up in here.

311
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,580
-什么  -你下来看看
- Say what? - Come on down.

312
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,290
-漂亮吗  -现在先别撸
- She hot? - Don't grab your pecker just yet.

313
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,420
她没在这
She ain't here.

314
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,130
你们瞎嚷嚷什么呢
What the hell you hollering about?

315
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,440
找到了她的衬衫
Found her shirt.

316
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,900
肯定是今天早上才洗的
Must have washed it this morning.

317
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,970
-好香啊  -你们找到了衬衫
- Smells good. - Oh, you found a shirt?

318
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,940
她搞不好已经离开很久了
She could be miles away by now.

319
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,050
她就没必要费力气
Why'd she go to all the trouble of washing a shirt

320
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,820
洗一件要扔的衬衫
when she's just gonna ditch it?

321
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,900
-她会回来的  -她回来之后  我要第一个上
- She'll be back. - I call first when she gets here.

322
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,780
谁知道她有没有同伴呢
Who knows who else she got with her.

323
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,480
我们得做好万全准备
We need to be ready for anything.

324
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,730
-伦  你去侧面房间  -等一下  我去拿枪
- Len, take the side room. - Hold on, let me get a gun.

325
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,740
我会盯着前厅  你负责另一侧的房间
I'll watch the front den, you've got the other side room.

326
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,340
-我以为托尼负责呢  -托尼跑哪去了
- I thought Tony got that. - Where the hell is Tony?

327
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,470
托尼
Tony!

328
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,120
把他叫起来
Get him the hell up.

329
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,980
我们当时开着卡车执行护送任务
We were running a convoy in one of these.

330
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,110
开上一个沙丘  有个骆驼站在那
Coming up a dune, there's this camel,

331
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,750
看起来像是要吐
looks like it's about to puke.

332
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,880
可能是因为哪个混蛋给它屁股上
Probably because shitbird's packed

333
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,260
驼了大概1.8公斤的C-4炸弹
about four pounds of C-4 up its ass.

334
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,540
我们距离爆炸点也就六米左右
We were within 20 feet of that blast

335
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:04,310
驼峰炸飞出去了半公里
that sent that animal's hump half a klick into the desert.

336
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,470
然后我们还能开车回去
And we drove home.

337
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,370
所以你跟我说说你到底做了什么
So you tell me how in the holy hell

338
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,580
才能让这卡车抛锚
did you possibly kill this truck?

339
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,810
高度兴奋的状态
A fully amped-up state

340
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,980
和对速射武器的无知
and an ignorance of rapid-firing weapons.

341
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,450
这是你的吗
Is this yours?

342
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,540
车子坏了我很遗憾
Sorry about your ride.

343
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,950
希望你们能到达华府
Hope you guys make it to Washington.

344
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,290
等等我
Wait for me.

345
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,140
我们他妈的还能干什么
What the hell else are we gonna do?

346
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,570
去华府啊
Go to Washington.

347
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,620
拯救世界啊
Fix the whole damn world!

348
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,280
那条路安全  北边就难说了
That way's clear. Who knows what's north.

349
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,410
我们先跟着他们  找到车再离开
We'll find another vehicle. We'll go with them until we do.

350
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,350
相信我  我比你聪明
Trust me. I'm smarter than you.

351
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,890
拜托
Come on.

352
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,280
-挡住它  -奶奶的
- Stop her! - Son of bitch.

353
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,140
杀了它  杀了它
Kill her! Kill her!

354
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,860
走  走
Go! Go!

355
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,090
不得不说
Got to hand it to him.

356
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,240
这小子真坚决
He's a persistent son of a bitch.

357
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,450
我知道你为什么跟随他了
I get why you're following him.

358
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,210
你很忠心
You're loyal.

359
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,320
你是个好人
You're a good person.

360
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,000
我喜欢
I like it.

361
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,910
但我们要做的事
But what we're doing--

362
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,720
我不知道该怎么说
I don't know how else to say it--

363
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,210
拯救世界
saving the world is just--

364
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,380
更为重要
is just more important.

365
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,180
就算他找到妻子
I mean, even if he does find his wife,

366
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,060
那又怎样
so what?

367
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,910
如果我们不把尤金送到华府
How long do you think they'll live happily ever after

368
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,160
你觉得他们能安稳生活多久
if we don't get Eugene up to Washington?

369
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,160
你以为我跟着格伦
You think because I'm following Glenn,

370
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,600
就说明我是个好人吗
that makes me a good person?

371
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,180
我不是好人
I'm not.

372
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,530
你是好人
You're good.

373
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,120
你根本不了解我
You don't know anything about me.

374
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,750
正如我也不了解你为什么要去华府
Just like I don't know anything about why you're going to Washington.

375
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,410
我知道尤金为什么去
I get why Eugene's going.

376
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,060
他是唯一一个知道如何终结这一切的人
He's the only one that knows how to end this.

377
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,110
而罗西塔是因为爱你  她会永远伴你左右
And Rosita, she loves you. She'd follow you anywhere.

378
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,260
但你为什么同意
But why the hell you agreed

379
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,030
带他穿越大半个国家...
to drive him halfway across the country...

380
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,210
我想拯救世界就这么难相信吗
Is that hard to believe, I want to save the world?

381
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,140
仅仅因为你是个好人吗
Because you're a good person?

382
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,870
你不用告诉我真正原因
You don't have to tell me why.

383
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,910
但也别骗我
Just don't lie to me.

384
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,620
乳酪布丁
Crazy Cheese?

385
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,110
你怎么看
What do you think?

386
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,670
我们去吧
Let's go.

387
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,820
去吧
Let's go.

388
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,930
避难所和社区  欢迎所有人
抵达就能活命
