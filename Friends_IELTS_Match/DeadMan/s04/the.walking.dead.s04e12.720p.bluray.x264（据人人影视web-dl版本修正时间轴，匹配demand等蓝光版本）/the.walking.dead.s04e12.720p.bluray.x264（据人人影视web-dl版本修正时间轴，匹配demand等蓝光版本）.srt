I need a drink.

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,640
不  我是说真家伙
No, I mean a real drink.

22
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,060
比如说酒
As in alcohol.

23
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,570
我从没喝过
I've never had one.

24
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,450
因为我爸爸
'Cause of my dad.

25
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,590
但他不在了  所以...
But he's not exactly around anymore, so...

26
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,090
我觉得我们可以去找一些
I thought we could go find some.

27
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,180
好吧
Okay.

28
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,940
慢慢吃你的蛇肉干吧
Well, enjoy your snake jerky.

29
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,890
混蛋
Jerk.

30
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
我们好像找到路了
I think we made it a way.

31
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,790
我很肯定得走那边才找的到酒
I'm pretty sure we got to go that way to find the booze.

32
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,450
搞什么
What the hell?

33
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,540
你又把我带回来了
You brought me back.

34
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,420
我才不要待在那个逊毙了的营地
I'm not staying in this suck-ass camp.

35
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,850
你玩够了没有
Hey! You had your fun.

36
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,910
你有毛病吗  你难道没感情吗
What the hell is wrong with you? Do you feel anything?

37
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,660
是啊  你觉得一切都玩完了
Yeah, you think everything's screwed.

38
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,010
我想那也是一种感情
I guess that's a feeling.

39
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,670
所以你想盯着一堆火
So you want to spend the rest of our lives

40
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,760
吃着泥蛇度过余生吗
staring into a fire and eating mud snakes?

41
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,610
去他的
Screw that.

42
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,980
我们倒不如做点别的
We might as well do something.

43
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,550
我能照顾好自己
I can take care of myself

44
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,460
我一定要去喝杯酒
and I'm gonna get a damn drink.

45
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,180
高尔夫球手嗜酒成性  对吗
Golfers like to booze it up, right?

46
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,740
快走
Come on.

47

48
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,970
里面可能有人
Might be people inside.

49
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,490
走吧
Come on.

50
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,650
华盛顿特区  国会大厦

51
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,000
你为什么要拿那些东西
Why are you keeping all that stuff?

52
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,200
快走
Come on.

53
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,360
谢谢你帮我
Thanks for the help.

54
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,030
你说过能照顾好自己
You said you could take care of yourself.

55
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,170
真是呢
You did.

56
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,730

58
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,660
富家婊

59
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,110
帮我把她放下
Help me take her down.

60
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,130
无所谓了  她死了
It don't matter. She's dead.

61
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,400
有所谓
It does matter.

62
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,130
用这个
Here.

63
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,060
好的
Okay.

64
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,260
快走
Move.

65
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:11,960
我们到了
We made it.

66
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,860
我知道你觉得这很傻
I know you think this is stupid.

67
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,290
可能真的很傻
And it probably is.

68
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,690
但我不在乎
But I don't care.

69
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,440
我今天只想躺下大哭
All I wanted to do today was lay down and cry,

70
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,820
但是我们没这个权力
but we don't get to do that.

71
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,060
所以要是想撒气的话就去暴打行尸好了
So beat up on walkers if that makes you feel better.

72
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,030
我必须这么做
I need to do this.

73
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,800
你有必要弄碎玻璃吗
Did you have to break the glass?

74
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,670
没有
No.

75
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,100
你找到喝的了吗
You have your drink yet?

76
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,880
没有
No.

77
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
但我找到这个了
But I found this.

78
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,940
桃味蒸馏酒
Peach schnapps.

79
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,230
-好喝吗  -不好喝
- Is it good? - No.

80
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,620
只剩下这个了
Well, it's the only thing left.

81
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,860
何必用酒杯呢
Who needs a glass?

82
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,080
你第一次喝酒
Ain't gonna have your first drink

83
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,780
不能就喝这个破桃味蒸馏酒
be no damned peach schnapps.

84
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,540
走吧
Come on.

85
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,920
摩托车修理工
A motorcycle mechanic.

86
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,850
-什么  -我猜的
- Huh? - That's my guess.

87
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,120
灾变前你所从事的职业
For what you were doing before the turn.

88
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,270
扎克也是这么猜的吗
Did Zack ever guess that one?

89
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,740
无关紧要了
It don't matter.

90
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,850
已经无关紧要很久了
Hasn't mattered for a long time.

91
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,760
人们就是这么聊天的
It's just what people talk about,

92
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
为了感觉自己是个正常人
you know, to feel normal.

93
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,040
我从没觉得这么聊很正常
Yeah, well, that never felt normal to me.

94
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,330
我跟米琼恩找到的这个地方
Found this place with Michonne.

95
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,460
我以为是酒水店
I was expecting a liquor store.

96
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,270
不是  这个更好
No, this is better.

97
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,830
那是什么
What's that?

98
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,270
私酒
Moonshine.

99
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,980
来吧
Come on.

100
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,540
好了
All right.

101
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,410
这才是第一次该喝的酒
That's a real first drink right there.

102
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,560
怎么了
What's the matter?

103
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,030
没什么
Nothing.

104
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,470
只是...
It's just...

105
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,020
我爸总是说  喝劣质私酒会致盲
my dad always said bad moonshine can make you go blind.

106
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,310
反正外面也没有什么值得看了
Ain't nothing worth seeing out there anymore anyway.

107
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,770
这是我喝过的最恶心的东西
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.

108
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,240
喝到第二口就好多了
Second round's better.

109
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,190
慢点喝
Slow down.

110
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,130
-这杯是给你倒的  -不用了
- This one's for you. - No, I'm good.

111
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,270
-为什么  -得有个人留神
- Why? - Someone's got to keep watch.

112
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,520
怎么  你现在是我的保护人吗
So, what, you're like my chaperone now?

113
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,420
你就多喝点水吧
Just drink lots of water.

114
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,860
是  迪克森先生
Yes, Mr. Dixon.

115
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,130
谁会走进一家商店
Who'd go into a store

116
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,820
然后拎着这玩意儿出来
and walk out with this?

117
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,050
我爸  他就愿意
My dad, that's who.

118
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,920
他就是个傻帽
Oh, he's a dumbass.

119
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,860
他会把那些摆在电视上
He'd set those up on top of the TV set,

120
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,460
用它们来练射击
use them as target practice.

121
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,430
他在家里开枪射击吗
He shot things inside your house?

122
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,880
反正那只是一堆垃圾
It was just a bunch of junk anyway.

123
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,610
所以我知道这地方以前是什么
That's how I knew what this place was.

124
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,580
外面的那个棚屋
That shed out there,

125
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,750
我爸之前也有那样的棚屋
my dad had a place just like this.

126
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,680
有个大靠椅
You got your Dumpster chair.

127
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,730
你坐在上头  抽屉里全是夏季饮料
That's for sitting in and your drawers all summer drinking.

128
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,030
旁边有个花哨的大桶
Got your fancy buckets.

129
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,610
那是用来吐嚼烟的
That's for spitting chaw in

130
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,310
因为你家老太婆叫你戒烟
after your old lady tells you to stop smoking.

131
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,180
这个是你的"互联网"
You got your Internet.

132
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,120
-只有一个  -我们要去干掉它吗
- It's just one of 'em. - Should we get it?

133
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,500
假如它一直吵个不停  那就干掉
If he keeps making too much noise, yeah.

134
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,350
假如我们又要被困住
Well, if we're gonna be trapped again,

135
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,140
我们最好随遇而安
we might as well make the best of it.

136
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,210
除非你忙着保护我  迪克森先生
Unless you're too busy chaperoning, Mr. Dixon.

137
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,050
对啊  最好随遇而安
Hell, might as well make the best of it.

138
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
家  可爱的家
Home, sweet home.

139
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,190
首先  我说一件我从没做过的事
So first, I say something I've never done

140
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,300
假如你做过这件事  你就得喝酒
and if you have done it, you drink,

141
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,130
假如你没做过  那就我喝
and if you haven't, I drink.

142
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,730
然后换你说
Then we switch.

143
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,050
你真的不知道这个游戏吗
You really don't know this game?

144
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,830
我从不需要游戏来喝醉
I never needed a game to get lit before.

145
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,570
等等  我们开始玩了吗
Wait, are we starting?

146
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,300
-你从哪学的  -我朋友玩过
- How do you know this game? - My friends played.

147
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,900
我看过  好了  从我开始
I watched. Okay, I'll start.

148
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,980
我从没射过十字弩
I've never shot a crossbow.

149
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,110
你喝酒吧
So now you drink.

150
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,710
这不算游戏吧
Ain't much of a game.

151
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,170
热身而已  换你了
That was a warm-up. Now you go.

152
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,260
我不知道
I don't know.

153
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,840
随便说你想到的第一件事
Just say the first thing that pops into your head.

154
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,240
我从没出过乔治亚州
I've never been out of Georgia.

155
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,090
真的吗  这个不错
Really? Okay, good one.

156
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,800
我从没
I've never...

157
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,140
喝醉做出后悔的事
been drunk and did something I regretted.

158
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,780
我倒干过很多
I've done a lot of things.

159
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,840
轮到你了
Your turn.

160
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,650
我从没度过假
I've never been on vacation.

161
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,090
野营算吗
What about camping?

162
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,300
不算  那只是学打猎的必修课
No, that was just something I had to learn to hunt.

163
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,080
你爸爸教你的吗
Your dad teach you?

164
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,040
好吧
Okay.

165
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,000
我从没
I've never...

166
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,640
进过监狱
been in jail.

167
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,490
我是说  没当过囚犯
I mean, as a prisoner.

168
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,680
你就是那么看我的吗
Is that what you think of me?

169
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,290
我不是说什么大事儿
I didn't mean anything serious.

170
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,610
就是喝醉被拘留什么的
I just thought, you know, like the drunk tank.

171
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,210
连我爸都因此进过牢房
Even my dad got locked up for that back in the day.

172
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,330
-喝吧  -等等
- Drink up. - Wait.

173
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,460
狱警
Prison guard.

174
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,610
你以前是狱警吗
Were you a prison guard before?

175
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,570
不是
No.

176
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,980
又轮到你了
It's your turn again.

177
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
我去小便
I'm gonna take a piss.

178
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,950
安静点
You have to be quiet.

179
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,860
我听不清  我在小便
Can't hear you! I'm taking a piss!

180
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,600
达里尔  别这么大声
Daryl, don't talk so loud.

181
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,990
怎么  你是我的保护人吗
What, are you my chaperone now?

182
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,610
等等
Oh, wait.

183
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,800
轮到我了对吧
It's my turn, right?

184
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,550
我从没
I've never--

185
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,400
从没吃过酸奶冰淇淋
never eaten frozen yogurt.

186
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,310
从没养过宠物小马
Never had a pet pony.

187
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,540
从没收过圣诞老人的礼物
Never got nothing from Santa Claus.

188
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,990
从不需要他人庇护
Never relied on anyone for protection before.

189
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,910
妈的  老子从没依赖过任何人
Hell, I don't think I've ever relied on anyone for anything.

190
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,990
-达里尔  -我从没当着大伙儿的面唱歌
- Daryl. - Never sung out in front of a big group

191
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,280
以为这一切很有趣
out in public like everything was fun.

192
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,130
以为这是一场游戏
Like everything was a big game.

193
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,440
我他妈的也从没割腕求关注  
I sure as hell never cut my wrists looking for attention.

194
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,460
听起来外面的朋友
Sounds like our friend out there

195
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,530
在召唤它的兄弟们
is trying to call all of his buddies.

196
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,810
-达里尔  快住嘴  -嘿  你从没用过弩是吧
- Daryl, just shut up. - Hey, you never shot a crossbow before?

197
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,390
我现在就教你
I'm gonna teach you right now.

198
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:46,500
来吧  会很有趣的
Come on. It's gonna be fun.

199
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,950
我们应该待在屋里  达里尔  住手
We should stay inside. Daryl, cut it out!

200
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,940
达里尔  
Daryl!

201
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,910
蠢货  来呀  蠢货
Dumbass. Come here, dumbass.

202
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,850
-达里尔  -你想试试吗
- Daryl. - You want to shoot?

203
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,870
-我不会  -很简单
- I don't know how. - Oh, it's easy.

204
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,850
过来  瞄准右角  
Come here. Right corner.

205
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,960
以后再练吧
Let's practice later.

206
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,210
-接着来  很有趣  -别闹了
- Come on, it's fun. - Just stop it.

207
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,470
-达里尔  -过来
- Daryl! - Come here.

208
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,800
-八球进洞  -快干掉它
- Eight ball. - Just kill it!

209
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,030
格林  过来  我们把箭拔出来
Come here, Greene. Let's pull these out.

210
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,700
那它当靶子多练练手
Get a little more target practice.

211
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,720
你杀它干嘛  爷正乐着呢
What the hell you do that for? I was having fun.

212
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,050
才不  你太混蛋了
No, you were being a jackass.

213
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,190
-如果有人对我老爸...  -别
- If anyone found my dad-- - Don't.

214
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,700
这两个根本不是一回事
That ain't remotely the same.

215
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,270
杀行尸不应该是有趣的
Killing them is not supposed to be fun.

216
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,540
那你到底要我怎么做  丫头
What do you want from me, girl, huh?

217
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,710
我想让你别一副
I want to you stop acting

218
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,770
什么都不在意的样子
like you don't give a crap about anything.

219
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,940
就好像我们经历的这一切都毫无意义
Like nothing we went through matters.

220
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,640
那些去世的人对你来说都一文不值一样
Like none of the people we lost meant anything to you.

221
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,950
这太混账了
It's bullshit!

222
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,530
-你是这么想的吗  -我知道就是这样
- Is that what you think? - That's what I know.

223
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,480
你什么也不懂
You don't know nothing.

224
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,230
我知道在你眼里我只是个将死的女孩
I know you look at me and you just see another dead girl.

225
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,900
我不是米琼恩  不是卡萝儿  也不是玛姬
I'm not Michonne. I'm not Carol. I'm not Maggie.

226
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,780
我活下来了  你却不明白
I've survived and you don't get it

227
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,840
虽然我不像你或者其他人
'cause I'm not like you or them.

228
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,480
但我做到了  你不能因为自己畏惧
But I made it and you don't get to treat me like crap

229
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,960
就这样对我
just because you're afraid.

230
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,130
我无所畏惧
I ain't afraid of nothing.

231
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,700
我记得
I remember.

232
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,330
当那个小女孩跟在我妈身后
When that little girl came out of the barn

233
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,210
从谷仓出来时
after my mom.

234
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,450
你就跟我一样
You were like me.

235
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,950
而从那以后
And now God forbid

236
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,030
你就不敢亲近任何人
you ever let anybody get too close.

237
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,170
亲近是吗  你当然懂了
Too close, huh? You know all about that.

238
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,150
你失去了两个男友  一滴眼泪都没流
You lost two boyfriends, you can't even shed a tear.

239
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,490
你全家人都没了
Your whole family's gone,

240
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,750
你却像个愚蠢的大学生一样
all you can do is just go out looking for hooch

241
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,100
出去找酒喝
like some dumb college bitch.

242
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,820
去你的  你根本不了解情况
Screw you. You don't get it.

243
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,150
是你不了解情况
No, you don't get it!

244
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,900
-我们认识的人都死了  -你根本不确定
- Everyone we know is dead! - You don't know that!

245
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,510
没什么差别  因为你再也不会见到他们
Might as well be, 'cause you ain't never gonna see 'em again.

246
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,480
瑞克  你再也见不到玛姬了
Rick. You ain't never gonna see Maggie again.

247
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,050
-达里尔  别说了  -不
- Daryl, just stop.  - No!

248
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,900
总督直接来到了我们家门口
The Governor rolled right up to our gates.

249
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,330
如果当初我没有停止寻找他
Maybe if I wouldn't have stopped looking.

250
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,840
也许这一切都是我的错  因为我放弃了
Maybe 'cause I gave up. That's on me.

251
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,600
-达里尔  -不
- Daryl.  - No--

252
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,060
还有你爸
And your dad.

253
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,540
或许  我本可以做点什么
Maybe-- maybe I could have done something.

254
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,180
我明白我爸为什么戒酒了
I get why my dad stopped drinking.

255
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,440
你想吐吗
You feel sick?

256
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,320
没有
Nope.

257
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,360
我希望我能一直有这样的感觉
I wish I could feel like this all the time.

258
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,010
这可不好
That's bad.

259
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,220
形容酒品好  反义为"愤怒的醉鬼"

260
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,220
你很幸运  你是个快乐的醉鬼
You're lucky you're a happy drunk.

261
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,940
没错  我很幸运
Yeah, I'm lucky.

262
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,490
有的人喝醉后就各种撒泼耍赖
Some people can be real jerks when they drink.

263
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,650
是的  我喝醉之后就那样
Yeah, I'm a dick when I'm drunk.

264
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,610
莫尔有个毒贩朋友
Merle had this dealer.

265
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,740
一个讨人嫌的小个子白人
This janky little white guy.

266
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,340
瘾君子
A tweaker.

267
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,840
某天  我们在他家看电视
One day we were over at his house watching TV.

268
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,050
还没到中午  我们都喝高了
Wasn't even noon yet and we were all wasted.

269
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,320
莫尔嗑嗨了
Merle was high.

270
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,120
我们在看一个电视节目
We were watching this show

271
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,430
莫尔一直说那个节目很难看
and Merle was talking all this dumb stuff about it.

272
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,710
不肯闭嘴
And he wouldn't let up.

273
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,430
他一直如此
Merle never could.

274
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,700
结果
Turns out,

275
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,240
那是那瘾君子的孩子们最喜欢的节目
it was the tweaker's kids' favorite show.

276
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,140
他从没见过他的孩子们
And he never sees his kids,

277
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,860
所以他觉得内疚了之类的
so he felt guilty about it or something.

278
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,700
所以狠狠揍在莫尔脸上
So he punches Merle in the face.

279
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,660
所以我就狠狠地揍那瘾君子
So I started hitting the tweaker, like, hard.

280
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,930
能多狠就多狠
As hard as I can.

281
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,020
他抽出一把枪来
Then he pulls a gun,

282
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,820
顶着我的脑袋
sticks it right here.

283
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,690
他说  我要杀了你  混蛋
He says, "I'm gonna kill you, bitch."

284
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,880
所以莫尔也抽出枪来对着他
So Merle pulls his gun on him.

285
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,370
大家都在大吼  我也大吼
Everyone's yelling. I'm yelling.

286
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,010
我以为我会死
I thought I was dead.

287
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,410
就因为一个会讲话的小狗的蠢动画
Over a dumb cartoon about a talking dog.

288
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,520
你们怎么脱险的
How'd you get out of it?

289
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,890
瘾君子揍了我肚子
The tweaker punched me in the gut.

290
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,730
我吐了
I puked.

291
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,330
他们俩就开始笑  忘了这一切
They both started laughing and forgot all about it.

292
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,440
你想知道灾难之前我是什么样的人吗
You want to know what I was before all this?

293
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,480
我跟着莫尔四处漂流
I was just drifting around with Merle...

294
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,170
他让我做什么我就做什么
Doing whatever he said we were gonna be doing that day.

295
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,660
我微不足道
I was nobody.

296
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,200
一无是处
Nothing.

297
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,690
是个混蛋乡巴佬
Some redneck asshole

298
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,200
有个更混蛋的哥哥
and an even bigger asshole for a brother.

299
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,980
你想他了  是吧
You miss him, don't you?

300
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,380
我也想玛姬
I miss Maggie.

301
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,320
我想念她支使我
I miss her bossing me around.

302
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,330
我想念我哥哥沙恩
I miss my big brother Shawn.

303
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,860
他曾经很烦  过度保护我
He was so annoying and overprotective.

304
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,240
还有我爸爸
And my dad.

305
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,700
我以为
I thought--

306
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,140
我曾希望他余生生活得平静安逸  知道吗
I hoped he'd just live the rest of his life in peace, you know?

307
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,190
我以为玛姬和格伦会有个孩子
I thought Maggie and Glenn would have a baby.

308
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,780
我爸爸会当上姥爷
And he'd get to be a grandpa.

309
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,750
我们一起过生日  度假
And we'd have birthdays and holidays

310
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,270
还有夏日野餐
and summer picnics.

311
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,070
然后他会变老
And he'd get really old.

312
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,040
死亡会来临  但会很平静
And it'd happen, but it'd be quiet.

313
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,010
不会有事
It'd be okay.

314
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,290
他的周围会是他爱的人
He'd be surrounded by people he loved.

315
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,610
我就是这么难以置信的蠢
That's how unbelievably stupid I am.

316
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,680
本来就该是这样
That's how it was supposed to be.

317
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,990
真希望我可以
I wish I could just...

318
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,320
改变
change.

319
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,260
你变了
You did.

320
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,330
还不够
Not enough.

321
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,310
不像你
Not like you.

322
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,090
你好像天生就适合现在的情况
It's like you were made for how things are now.

323
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,350
我只是习惯了  糟糕的情况
I'm just used to it, things being ugly.

324
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,340
我在这种地方长大
Growing up in a place like this.

325
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,390
但你逃离了这种地方
Well, you got away from it.

326
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,650
-我没有  -你有
- I didn't. - You did.

327
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,280
也许你该时不时提醒一下我
Maybe you got to keep on reminding me sometimes.

328
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,580
不
No.

329
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,090
你不可以依赖别人  记得吗
You can't depend on anybody for anything, right?

330
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,500
-我早晚也会离开  -别这么说
- I'll be gone someday. - Stop.

331
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,640
我会的
I will.

332
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,520
你会站到最后
You're gonna be the last man standing.

333
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,400
你会的
You are.

334
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,480
等我离开了你会非常想我  达里尔・迪克森
You're gonna miss me so bad when I'm gone, Daryl Dixon.

335
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,820
你完全不是个快乐的醉鬼
You ain't a happy drunk at all.

336
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,630
我很快乐  只是不瞎
Yeah, I'm happy. I'm just not blind.

337
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,000
你得着眼现在
You got to stay who you are,

338
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,670
而不是怀恋过去
not who you were.

339
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,810
这样的地方
Places like this,

340
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,040
你必须忘记
you have to put it away.

341
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,750
忘不了呢
What if you can't?

342
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,210
必须忘记
You have to.

343
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,320
否则会难受死
Or it kills you.

344
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,960
在心里
Here.

345
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,810
我们该进去了
We should go inside.

346
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,380
我们该把屋子烧了
We should burn it down.

347
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,910
我们需要更多酒
We're gonna need more booze.

348
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:29,020
Up The Wolves
The Mountain Goats

349
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,260
? There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet ?

350
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,450
? No matter where you live ?

351
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:51,260
? There'll always be a few things, maybe several things ?

352
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,710
? That you're gonna find really difficult to forgive ?

353
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,470
-你要来吗  -必须的
- You wanna? - Hell, yeah.

354
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,030
? There's gonna come a day when you feel better ?

355
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,170
? You'll rise up free and easy on that day ?

356
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,490
? And float from branch to branch ?

357
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,270
? Lighter than the air ?

358
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,010
? Just when that day is coming ?

359
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,370
? Who can say? Who can say? ?

360
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,190
? Our mother has been absent ?

361
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,320
? Ever since we founded Rome ?

362
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,000
? But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home ?

363
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,590
? I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim ?

364
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,330
? Scope out every angle of unfair advantage ?

365
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,380
? I'm gonna bribe the officials ?

366
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,510
? I'm gonna kill all the judges ?

367
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,240
? It's gonna take you people years ?

368
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,830
? To recover from all of the damage ?

369
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,980
? Our mother has been absent ?

370
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,030
? Ever since we founded Rome ?

371
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:23,650
? But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home ?
