1
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,420
你发现时他们就这样了吗
You found them like this?

2
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,960
我来看凯伦...
I came to see Karen...

3
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,250
发现了地上的血迹
and I saw the blood on the floor.

4
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,210
然后闻到了气味
Then I smelled them.

5
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,960
有人把他们拖到这里
Somebody dragged them out here

6
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,260
然后放火焚烧
and set them on fire.

7
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,860
他们杀了他们  然后放火焚烧
They killed them and set them on fire!

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,950
你是个警察
You're a cop.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,440
你查清楚是谁干的  然后把他们交给我
You find out who did this and you bring 'em to me.

10
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,430
听懂了吗  把他们交给我
You understand? You bring 'em to me.

11
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,530
我们会查出是谁...
We'll find out who--

12
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,810
-我需要重复吗  -不用
- I need to say it again? - No. No.

13
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,220
我知道你的感受  我也经历过
I know what you're feeling. I've been there.

14
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,590
你见过我的样子  那很危险
You saw me there. It's dangerous.

15
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,520
-凯伦不该被烧死  -对
- Karen didn't deserve this. - No.

16
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,000
大卫不该被烧死
David didn't deserve it.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,250
-谁都不该  -好了  哥们  别...
- Nobody does. - All right, man, let's--

18
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,080
不查出是谁干的  我绝不离开
Man, I ain't going nowhere till I find out who did this!

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,390
我们是一边的  哥们
We're on the same side, man.

20
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,550
听着
Hey, look,

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,510
我知道你的感受
I know what you're going through.

22
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,970
我们都失去过爱人
We've all lost someone.

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,820
我们知道你现在的感受
We know what you're going through right now,

24
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,150
但你得冷静下来
but you've got to calm down.

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,300
-你给我退后  -别这样
- You need to step the hell back! - No.

26
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,230
她不会想要你这样的
She wouldn't want you being like this.

27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,770
住手  住手
Stop! Stop!

28
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,090

That's enough.

我说的不是你的手
I wasn't talking about the hand.

61

我们刚经历了可怕的事
We just went through something terrible.

62
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,490
那些我们竭力阻止的事情
Everything we've been working so hard to keep out,

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,250
终究还是发生了
it found its way in.

不

Thought you should know.

68
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,310
我们失去了12名同胞
We just lost 12 of our own.

69
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,340
还有两名被无情杀害
Two more we killed in cold blood.

70
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,960
疫情恐怕难以控制
We could be facing an outbreak.

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,100
仅仅一天  我就闯了不少祸
I think I've done enough damage for one day.

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,790
我以前也失控过
I've fallen off the wagon before.

73
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,290
-是一回事吗  -差不多
- That's what this is? - Pretty close.

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,430
当遇到问题  我不会唉声叹气
When it happened, I didn't stand around feeling bad about it.

75
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,090
我会挺住
I got back up.

76
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,750
我会担起责任
I had responsibilities.

77
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,990
保护大家的安全
People to keep safe.

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,770
老兄  去清洗下伤口吧
Let's get you cleaned up, man.

79
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,720
说不定要缝上几针
You might even need a couple stitches.

80
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,540
先把他们安葬了再说
Not until they're in the ground.

81
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,030
那你至少得让赫谢尔或者斯蒂文斯医生看看
You should at least let Hershel or Dr. S. take a look at you,

82
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,470
确保没什么大碍
make sure nothing's broken.

83
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,680
先把他们安葬了再说
When they're in the ground.

84
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,100
我不会有事的  对吧
I'm gonna be okay, though, right?

85
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
你看凯伦和大卫都已经被感染了
I mean, Karen and David, they were already sick.

86
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,090
所以要感染的话  这会儿早就被感染了
So if we were gonna get it, we'd have had it by now.

87
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,690
又没有固定的发病时间
It doesn't happen on a timeline.

88
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,070
这是因人而异的
It's different with everyone.

89
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,440
但我们会没事的
But we could be okay.

90
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,270
对  会没事的
Yeah, we could be.

91
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,310
一切都会好起来的
Everything could be okay.

92
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,700
如果是跟行尸  跟活人正面交锋
If it's walkers, if it's people,

93
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,730
我们还有法子  可以拼了
we can do something. We can fight.

94
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,620
但遇上这个  我只能掘坟墓
But with this, I'm just digging graves.

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,940
得去找S医生
Got to see Dr. S.

96
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,800
我会没事的
I'm gonna be okay.

97
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,780
S医生
Dr. S....?

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
医生你在吗
Dr. S.?

99
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,110
我们必须告诉他们
We have to tell them.

100
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,490
感染扩散了
It's starting.

101
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,830
病毒传播很快
It's spread.

102
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,250
D区幸免遇难的人中  萨沙和迦勒已经感染
Everyone who survived the attack in cell block D.

103
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,090
现在其他人也出现了症状
Sasha, Caleb, and now others.

104
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,450
哦  天呐
Oh, Jesus.

105
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,060
那我们该怎么办
So what do we do?

106
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,760
当务之急  封锁A区
First things first. Cell block A is isolation.

107
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,340
像之前萨沙和迦勒那样  将所有被感染的人隔离  
We keep the sick people there like we tried with Karen and David.

108
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,550
那接下来又怎样
What the hell we gonna do about that?

109
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,870
让瑞克去调查
Ask Rick to look into it.

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,090
做个时间表  记录每个人在何时何地做什么
Try to make a timeline-- who's where when.

111
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,140
但要怎样才能阻止疫情恶化呢
But what are we gonna do to stop this?

112
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,850
没办法阻止
There is no stopping it.

113
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,820
被感染了  就会恶化
You get it, you have to go through it.

114
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,630
-那这不就是等死吗  -病毒本身不致命
- But it just kills you? - The illness doesn't.

115
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,850
是症状要命  我们需要抗生素
The symptoms do. We need antibiotics.

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
附近的药店我们都去过了
We've been through every pharmacy nearby.

117
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,230
没找到多少
And then some.

118
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,890
西桃工学院的兽医院
That veterinary college at West Peachtree Tech,

119
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,160
应该没人想到
that's one place people

120
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,440
去那里找药
may not have thought to raid for medication.

121
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,500
动物的药  人也能用
The drugs for animals there are the same we need.

122
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,920
距这里有50英里
That's 50 miles.

123
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,830
之前觉得太冒险
Too big a risk before.

124
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,540
现在不管了  我带一组人出去
Ain't now. I'm gonna take a group out.

125
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,280
抓紧时间
Best not waste any more time.

126
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,490
我也去
I'm in.

127
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,620
你没有接触过病毒
You haven't been exposed.

128
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,800
达里尔接触了  你跟他在一辆车里的话
Daryl has. You get in a car with him...

129
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,610
他已经把虱子传给我了
He's already given me fleas.

130
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,560
我可以带路
I can lead the way.

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,310
我知道东西放在哪
I know where everything's kept.

132
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,690
在外面的时候  每次都有危险
When we're out there, it's always the same.

133
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,050
早晚得跑步逃命
Sooner or later we run.

134
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,510
那我就给你们画张地图吧
I can draw you a map.

135
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,380
我们应该做一些其他的预防措施
There are other precautions I feel we should take.

136
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,560
比如
Like what?

137
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,200
达里尔这组人
There's no telling how long it'll be

138
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,250
什么时候回来说不准
before Daryl and his group return.

139
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,860
我们应该把最易被感染的人隔离开
Wouldn't it make sense for us to separate the most vulnerable?

140
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,750
我们可以用行政办公楼
We can use the administration building.

141
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,560
有独立的办公室和房间
Separate office, separate room.

142
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,430
谁是最易被感染的人
Who is the most vulnerable?

143
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,660
孩子们
The very young.

144
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,040
老人呢
What about the old?

145
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,670
我来试一下
Give me another go at it.

146
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,380
管子被泥土堵住了
The whole line's mudded up.

147
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,970
那头又掉到池底了
The end is dragging the bottom again.

148
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,790
我们得出去清理一下
We'll have to go out there and clear it.

149
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,310
设好诱饵  从墓地穿过去
Set the bird, go out through the tombs,

150
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,930
再从森林小路绕到后面
swing around through the forest route.

151
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,470
我们现在的水还够用  明天再说
We got enough for now. That's tomorrow's problem.

152
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,290
瑞克  萨沙被隔离之后
Rick, five more people

153
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,350
又有五个人死了
have come down with it since Sasha went in.

154
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,170
我们的人所剩无几
There's not a lot of us left.

155
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,330
要是你我病了怎么办
What if you get sick? What if I do?

156
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,550
我们要是在外面遇险回不来怎么办
What if we get in trouble out there and don't come back?

157
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,990
先把这水给需要的人
Let's get this up to the people who need it.

158
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,180
先把必要的事做好
Let's get what we have to get done first.

159
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,470
卡尔还在为被隔离的事生气吗
Is Carl pretty pissed about going into quarantine?

160
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,080
当然了
Of course.

161
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,680
但还是安全更重要
But it's better to be safe.

162
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,340
安全总是更重要
Always better to be safe.

163
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,320
你应该跟他谈谈
You should talk to him.

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,200
我们应该去哀悼一下
We should both pay our respects.

165
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,870
我先解决这个问题  待会儿见
I'll take this up first. Meet you.

166
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,360
对于发生的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about what happened.

167
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,500
我对你做的事情
What I did to you.

168
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,000
所有事
Everything.

169
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
我们都有责任
It's on both of us.

170
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,650
你要查出来是谁干的
You got to find who did this.

171
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,000
我不太了解大卫
I didn't know David much.

172
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,260
你呢
Did you?

173
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,110
有人和他或者和凯伦有仇吗
Did anyone have a problem with him or Karen?

174
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,490
不  不可能
No. No way.

175
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,760
我每天都跟她在一起
I was with her all the time, every day.

176
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,600
她跟所有人都相处得很好  大卫也是
She got along with everybody. Same with David.

177
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,830
当时只有他们两个病了
They were the only two who were sick.

178
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,620
做这件事的人可能是想阻止病毒蔓延
The person who did it might have trying to stop this thing from spreading.

179
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,810
他们没成功
They didn't.

180
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,340
如今萨沙也病了
Now Sasha has it.

181
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,770
听着  不管是谁干的
Look, whoever it was who did this,

182
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,510
他们逃不了的  我们会找到他们的
they're not going anywhere. We'll find them.

183
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,160
今天找  现在就找吗
Today? Right now?

184
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,590
因为我没觉得你很紧张这事儿
Because I'm not feeling the urgency.

185
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,100
我只看见你在泵水
All I see you doing is pumping water.

186
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,160
实际上  我的感觉是
In fact, what I'm picking up is

187
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,310
在这里  即便是谋杀也是可以被接受的
murder is okay in this place now.

188
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,640
不  不是的
No, it is not.

189
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,100
但我们得先保命
But we have to save lives first.

190
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,900
我们得维持这个地方的运转
We have to keep this place going.

191
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,240
你去操心那个吧
You worry about that.

192
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,290
我来操心正确的事
I'll worry about what's right.

193
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,060
这是为了你好
It's for your own good.

194
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,200
我很好
I'm fine.

195
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,740
我可不想和群孩子关在一起
I don't want to be locked away with a bunch of kids.

196
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,630
我需要你在那儿照看朱迪思和其他人
I need you in there keeping an eye on Judith and everybody else.

197
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,560
确保他们的安全
Making sure they're safe.

198
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,030
假如有人生病  你得让我知道
If anybody gets sick, you let me know.

199
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,210
若我发现时  他们已经变异了呢
What if they've already turned when I find them?

200
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,030
除非必要  你不能开枪
You don't fire unless you absolutely need to.

201
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,320
但你知道我有可能得开枪的  是吧
But you know I might need to, right?

202
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,800
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

203
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,660
会没事的
It's gonna be okay.

204
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,290
-格伦  -别
- Glenn? - Don't.

205
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,120
-别  别进来  -怎么了
- Don't-- don't come in. - What is it?

206
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,890
我病了
I have it.

207
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,630
他妈的机油不够了
Son of a bitch is about a quart low.

208
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,820
你还是把机油放在三号塔底了吧
You still keep it in the bottom of tower three?

209
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,980
是的
Yeah.

210
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,470
我去拿
I'll go get one.

211
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,280
我很开心你在这儿
I'm glad you're here.

212
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,740
我还能在哪儿
Where else would I be?

213
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,360
四处漂泊
Running off.

214
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,020
你知道我不会再漂泊了
You know I'm not running off.

215
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,920
所以还是像以前那样  只剩我和你了吗
So it's just gonna be me and you like in the old days?

216
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,050
是啊  还有鲍勃
Yeah, and Bob.

217
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,430
但还是缺个人手
Still, feels like we could use another person.

218
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,660
还有谁没病
Who else isn't sick?

219
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,030
我们没问瑞克
We don't ask Rick.

220
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,010
他想留下陪卡尔和小拽女
He wants to stay here with Carl and little ass-kicker.

221
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,520
确保他们安全
Keep them safe.

222
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,360
加上这儿有许多事他可以做
Plus there's plenty of stuff he could do here.

223
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,210
那我们还能找谁
So who else we got?

224
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,640
你在这儿
Oh, there you are.

225
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,850
我费了好大劲儿找你
Took me damn near forever to find you.

226
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,560
你在干嘛
Whatcha doing?

227
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,000
得有人看着  以防奸人图谋不轨
Somebody needs to stand watch.

228
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,520
伙计  我也想找到元凶
Man, I want to find them, too.

229
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,330
为他们干的事射他们一箭
Put a bolt in them for what they did.

230
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,090
这里被封锁了
These people are cut off.

231
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,470
如果有人进出的话
Ain't no way anyone's getting in and out

232
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,310
那么多人不可能没人看见
without a whole bunch of people seeing 'em.

233
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,340
萨沙还在里面  我哪里都不会去
Sasha's in there. I ain't going nowhere.

234
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,720
如果我们不带药回来  那在这里守着也没用
Standing guard ain't gonna do no good unless we come back with them meds.

235
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,390
好吧
All right.

236
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
我们在前门加油
We're gassing up by the front gate

237
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,790
改变主意了就来找我们
in case you change your mind.

238
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,320
平静的大海
练    不    出
优秀的水手

239
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,590
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

240
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,060
我在这下面躲开你们
I'm down here away from y'all

241
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,540
因为你们这些孩子应该离我远点
'cause you kids are supposed to stay away from me.

242
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,340
我在巡视走廊
I've been walking the halls.

243
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,680
我爸让我照看大家
My dad told me to look out for everyone.

244
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,580
你应该保持距离
you should keep your distance.

245
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,780
你在往出口走
You're walking towards the exit.

246
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,370
我要出去
I need to go out there.

247
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,000
去牢房吗
To the cell blocks?

248
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,650
去林子里
To the woods.

249
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,290
那你就是在偷偷溜走咯
So you're sneaking out.

250
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,000
我不需要任何人替我操心
Don't need anyone worrying about me

251
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,730
我也不想让别人告诉我能不能去
and I damn sure don't want someone telling me I can't go.

252
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,930
我不允许你独自去林子里
I can't just let you go out into the woods by yourself.

253
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,290
允许我
Let me?

254
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,580
我没法阻止你
I can't stop you.

255
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,000
但我必须告诉我爸
But I have to tell my dad.

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,920
那就去吧
Go ahead, then.

257
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,920
等你找到他时我已经在外面了
I'll be out there by the time you find him.

258
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,600
赫谢尔
Hershel.

259
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,370
如果你一定要去
If you have to go,

260
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,140
那我就跟你一起去
then I have to come with you.

261
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,620
卡尔

卡萝尔

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,570
米卡说你在这里
Mica said you were here.

269
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,460
我觉得不舒服
I don't feel good.

270
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,180
没事

去里面躺着吧

你会帮我盖被子吗
Will you tuck me in?

276
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,110
你认识我的朋友格伦吗
You know my friend Glenn?

277
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,680
他是我知道的最会盖被子的人
He's the best tucker I know.

278
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,420
他一定会让你觉得温暖舒适  好吗
And he'll make sure that you feel toasty and warm, okay?

279
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,930

谢谢你肯留在这里
Thanks for being in there.

283
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,740
我知道你不是非得这么做
I know you don't have to be.

284
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,060
但这对朱迪思意义重大
It means a lot you being in there with Judith.

285
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,740
外面还好吗
Things okay out there?

286
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,680
格伦被感染了

287
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
玛姬
Maggie.

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,560
我们不能沮丧
We don't get to be upset.

289
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,200
大家各司其职  爸爸总是这么说
We all got jobs to do. That's what Daddy always says.

290

达里尔和米琼恩会找到药的

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,790
还有瑞克要在他们回来前照顾大家
and Rick will help everyone till they get back.

293
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,920
我会照顾朱迪思
And I'll take care of Judith.

294
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,810
只需要关注我们该做的事
Just focus on what you have to do.

295
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,560
不论发生什么  我们都能解决

296
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,420
我们必须解决
We have to.

297
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,850
你爸什么时候把枪还你的
When did your dad give it back?

298
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,470
昨天
Yesterday.

299
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
就在那一切发生后
After everything happened.

300
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,100
你过去几个月成长了很多
You've grown a lot these last few months.

301
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,430
你知道要担起责任了
There's a responsibility about you.

302
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,400
让你冷静一段时间看来很有帮助
I think it's done you good to step back.

303
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,740
是啊
Yeah.

304
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,920
还可以
It was all right.

305
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,330
我不能总那样
Can't be like that all the time.

306
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,890
我自己在这里也没问题
I would have been fine on my own.

307
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,620
这里真平静
It's peaceful out here.

308
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,770
过去这几天
These last couple days,

309
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,440
在这墙外说不定比里面更安全
we might be safer outside those walls than in.

310
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,820
才不是呢
No, we're not.

311
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,100
我们走吧
Let's wrap this up.

312
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,660
别
Don't.

313
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,660
你不必这么做的
You don't need to.

314
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,910
刚才这里真是平静
It was so peaceful.

315
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,620
的确
It was.

316
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,750
但也不会总那样
Can't be like that all the time.

317
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,670
没有看起来那么糟
It's not as bad as it looks.

318
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,020
别哭
Don't do that.

319
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,940
好的
Okay.

320
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,090
我的样子肯定很糟
I must be a sight to see.

321
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,010
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

322
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,110
-我听说了凯伦的事  -别说了
- I heard about Karen-- - Don't.

323
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,800
现在别想这个
Don't think about that now.

324
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,950
想想努力康复
Think about getting better.

325
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,820
想想积极的事
Positive thoughts.

326
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,660
乐观一点
Positive vibes.

327
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
我不知道
I don't know.

328
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,200
达里尔带了一队人出去
Daryl's got a group going out.

329
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,100
他们去找药了
They're getting medicine.

330
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,390
赫谢尔知道个地方
Someplace Hershel knew about.

331
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,090
那个兽医学院吗
That veterinary college?

332
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,160
-那太远了  -但他们很有信心
- It's far. - But they feel sure about it.

333
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,390
说不定明天就有药了
So we could have medicine as early as tomorrow.

334
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,370
我们还有机会
We've got a chance.

335
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,860
-泰  -休息一下

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,400

情况还好吗
Everything look all right?

338
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,010

扎克把这车保养得很好
Zack kept this thing running pretty good.

340
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,430
这是扎克的车吗
This is Zack's car?

341
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,070
是啊  我们速度最快的车
Yeah, fastest one we got.

342
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,680
你还好吗
You all right?

343
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,580
你真的希望我陪你去吗
You really want me coming along?

344
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,310
这词怎么念
What's that word?

345
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,010
扎那米韦
"Zanamivir".

346
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,010
一种抗流感药

347
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,840
是啊  我们需要你
Yup, we need you.

348
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,640
-怎么了  -多一个人坐得下吗

很抱歉打扰你

你还好吗
You okay?

357
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,240
我要跟达里尔出去一趟
I'm going on the run with Daryl.

358
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,340
但我想知道
But I was wondering--

359
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,680
我知道有很多人都身处困境
I know there's a lot of people in trouble.

360
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,890
生病了
Sick.

361
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,640
我知道你是什么样的人
It's just I know how you are.

362
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,320
你在乎别人

363
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,080
谢谢
Thank you.

364
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,380
不知道你能不能帮我照顾萨沙
I was wondering if you could look in on Sasha for me.

365
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,330
有你照顾她  我就放心些
It would make me feel better knowing you were looking in on her.

366
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,340
如果不行的话...
If you can't--

367
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,520
不
No.

368
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,560
我乐意效劳
No, I'd be happy to.

369
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,480
谢谢
Thank you.

370
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,960
凯伦的事  我很遗憾
Oh, what happened to Karen, I'm so sorry.

371
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,560
你怎么不在隔离区
Why aren't you in quarantine?

372
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,730
我在那里对大家都没好处
I'm no good to anyone in there.

373
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,220
爸爸  求你了
Daddy, please.

374
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,780
玛姬  亲爱的  那里有很多人饱受煎熬
Maggie, dear, there are people in there suffering.

375

我能帮他们退烧  维持性命
I can bring their fever down and keep them stable.

376
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,690
达里尔去拿抗生素了
Daryl's getting the antibiotics.

377
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,060
他们有的人根本撑不过12小时
Some of these people won't last 12 hours.

378
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,270
我不能让你这样做
I can't let you do this.

379
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,150
玛姬  格伦就在里面
Maggie, Glenn's in there.

380
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,050
怎么回事
What's going on?

381
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,820
接骨木
Elderberries.

382
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,360
以前我妻子泡茶总会放这个
My wife used to make tea with them.

383
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,530
这是天然的抗流感药
They're a natural flu remedy.

384
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,540
迦勒病得厉害没法看病  但我可以
Caleb's too sick to help. I can.

385
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,440
我们有太多次对我们身上
There's so many times we haven't been able to do anything

386
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,360
所发生的不幸毫无回天之力
to change what was happening-- what was happening to us.

387
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,880
我们希望可以  事实却不尽如人意
We wished we could, but we couldn't.

388
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,690
但这次  我可以
This time, I can.

389
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,520
我很清楚
I know I can.

390
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,160
所以我必须这么做
So I have to.

391
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,230
赫谢尔  你进去会得病的
Hershel, if you go in there, you're gonna get sick.

392
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,510
等等  我们可不确定
Wait, we don't know that.

393
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,660
我们只知道这些人的病症必须得到控制
What we do know is that these people's symptoms need to be controlled.

394
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,080
赫谢尔  拜托  我们可以等等
Hershel, please. We can wait.

395
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,760
听我说  该死
Listen, damn it!

396
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,250
走出去是在冒生命危险
You step outside, you risk your life.

397
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,160
喝口水是在冒生命危险
You take a drink of water, you risk your life.

398
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,530
如今连呼吸
And nowadays you breathe,

399
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,980
都是在冒生命危险
and you risk your life.

400
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,260
现在我们别无选择
Every moment now you don't have a choice.

401
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,580
能选的只有为什么而冒险
The only thing you can choose is what you're risking it for.

402
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,620
我能让这些人好转一点
Now I can make these people feel better

403
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,290
多撑一阵子
and hang on a little bit longer.

404
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,670
救人一命
I can save lives.

405
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,970
这理由足以让我冒险了
That's reason enough to risk mine.

406
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,270
你们都明白
And you know that.

407
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,790
爸爸
Dad.

408
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,290
玛姬
Maggie?

409
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,640
爸爸走了
Daddy's gone.

410
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,990
他走了
He left.

411
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,590
我知道
I know.

412
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,840
他给你说去哪了吗
Did he tell you where he went?

413
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,560
没有  但是...
No, but...

414
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,110
我知道
I know.

415
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,270
怎么知道的
How?

416
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,830
S医生病了
Dr. S. is sick and...

417
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,560
我们要各司其职
We all got jobs to do.

418
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,990
我们能坚强面对的  对吧
We'll deal with it, right?

419
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,460
我们不能沮丧
We don't get to get upset.

420
