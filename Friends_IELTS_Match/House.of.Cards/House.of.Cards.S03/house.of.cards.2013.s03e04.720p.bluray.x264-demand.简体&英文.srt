如果不裁定这是错误的
If you do not say that this is wrong,

25
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,270
这是违反宪法的
that this is unconstitutional,

33

首席大法官先生及庭上  请容我说明
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court,

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,480
我国的无人机项目和其他秘密行动
the security of American citizens is the reason our drone program

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,900
正是为保护美国公民安全而存在
and other covert operations exist.

36
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,030
但维护安全往往要付出代价
But that security often comes with a cost.

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,660
此时此刻  总统正在阿灵顿公墓
At this very moment, the president is at Arlington Cemetery,

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,290
他们献出了自己的生命去拯救他人
They gave their lives to save others.

41
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,570
上帝对亚伯拉罕说"把你的儿子
And God said to Abraham, "Take your son,

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:07,400
{\pos(382,284)}{\an3}亚伯拉罕为《圣经》人物
希伯来民族的创始人
上帝要求他杀子献祭以考验其虔诚

43
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,180
你的独生子  你所爱的以撒  
your only son, whom you love, Isaac,

44
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,400
献为燔祭"
and sacrifice him."

45
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,950
亚伯拉罕答应了
Abraham was willing.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,660
但当他在圣坛边举刀对着以撒时
But when he raised his knife above Isaac on the altar,

47
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,770
上帝阻止了他
God stopped him.

48
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,030
因为亚伯拉罕已经证明了他对上帝的虔诚
For Abraham had proven his devotion to God.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,200
上帝为证明他对我们的爱
Then God, to prove his devotion to us,

50
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,050
也做出了牺牲
made his own sacrifice.

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,080
"上帝爱世人  甚至将他独子献给他们"
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son."

52
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,630
虔诚  牺牲
Devotion. Sacrifice.

53
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,450
爱
Love.

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,250
这就是上帝教导我们的
This is what the Lord teaches us.

55
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,550
也是这三位年轻人身体力行的
And what these young men have exemplified.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,620
我们将永远尊敬他们
We shall forever honor them.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,020
在天堂  他们将得永生
And in heaven, they will have eternal life.

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
阿门
Amen.

59
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,270
预备  拉
Ready, pull.

60
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,960
如您所知  在要求撤诉时
As you are aware, we have invoked the State secrets privilege

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,090
我们援引了国家机密特权
during our request for dismissal.

62
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,550
但现在总统授权我
But I have authority from the president

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,650
公开一些保密文件
to share some of the classified brief

64
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,520
旨在使政府的辩词更可信
in order to reinforce the government's argument.

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,900
你确定要这么做吗  邓巴女士
Are you certain you want to do that, Ms. Dunbar?

66
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,980
是的  首席大法官先生  总统也是
I am, Mr. Chief Justice. And so is the president.

67
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,370
那么政府是公开承认为这次袭击负责了
So the government is publicly admitting responsibility for the strike?

68
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,460
没错  法官阁下
It is, Your Honor.

69
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,200
我们成功定位了恐怖分子祖里·阿齐
The terrorist successfully targeted was Zuri Aziz.

70
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,100
他常常利用平民作为人盾
He routinely used civilians as human shields.

71
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,850
默罕默德先生一家不知与阿齐同处一栋楼
Mr. Mahmoud's family did not know Aziz was in the same building.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,070
无人机袭击该为他们的死亡负责
The drone strike is responsible for their deaths.

73
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,430
默罕默德先生遭受了巨大的伤害和损失
Mr. Mahmoud has suffered a terrible injury and loss.

74
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,020
政府的行动虽造成了悲剧  但并非不合法
While the government's action is tragic, it wasn't unlawful.

75
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,850
这次行动是合法  必需以及正确的
It was legal, it was necessary, and it was right.

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,290
希瑟·邓巴  她从没竞选过
Heather Dunbar? She's never run for office.

77
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,360
没有政治觉悟
You don't become Solicitor

78
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,190
是没法当上副检察长的
General without being politically savvy.

79
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,560
当选总统可不只需要觉悟
It takes more than savvy to be elected president.

80
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,440
别忘了
Don't forget,

81
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,070
沃克案调查后她在全国也有点名气了
she has a national profile after the Walker investigation.

82
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,790
真理和正义的化身
Truth and justice personified.

83

如果领导层想改变党的形象  她...
If the leadership wants to redefine the party, she's--

经验如此匮乏的强劲竞争者了
has ever been a real contender since Ross Perot,

87
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,300
而且他没经验却有的是钱
and at least he had the money.

88

她也有钱  她家族拥有邓巴装甲车公司
So does she. Her family owns Dunbar Armored Cars.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,650
有必要的话她能负担得起全部竞选费用
She could finance her entire campaign if she needed to.

90
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,350
但有什么能防止权力滥用呢
But what prevents the abuse of power?

91
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,700
行政机关不能立法  不能接受拨款
The executive can't legislate, can't receive appropriations,

92
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,580
不能判人入监
can't sentence people to imprisonment.

93
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,330
这些都要靠其他机构
All of these depend on the other branches,

94
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,410
保证行政权受控
which keeps executive power in check.

95
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,240
但我们都知道  紧急情况下
But we know for a fact that, in emergencies,

96
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,610
行政机关会考虑采取
the executive will contemplate actions

97
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,750
没有明确法律依据的行为
that do not have clear legislative authority

98
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,110
这可能就会与宪法相违背
and might be constitutionally dubious.

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,380
包括
Including--

100
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,460
您是要问无人机袭击吗  法官阁下
Are you asking about drone strikes, Your Honor?

101
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,320
没错  无人机袭击
Yes. Drone strikes.

102
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,820
对行政权失控的恐惧被夸大了
The fear of an out-of-control executive is exaggerated.

103
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,240
由于选举压力和其他政治因素
The president has strong electoral and other political incentives

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,730
总统采取行动得考虑公众利益
to act in the public interest.

105
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,060
你本人就曾调查过白宫滥用职权的案件
You yourself have investigated the White House for abuse of power.

106
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,840
最后迫使时任总统辞了职
It forced a president to resign.

107
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
而现在你又声称
Now you maintain that, uh,

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,660
我们应该给总统一些活动空间
we should give our president a wide berth?

109
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,930
我今天不是想维护某个个人
I am not here to defend any one person,

110
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,090
而是要维护总统体制
but rather the office of the presidency itself.

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,640
我们必须让政府里的每一个人按章守法办事
We must hold everyone in government accountable to the law.

112
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,660
但我们不能随意解释法律
But we must not manufacture our interpretation of the law

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,880
来侵蚀宪法赋予的权威
to erode constitutional authority.

114
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,800
我们能起诉总统本人  但不能动摇总统体制
We can prosecute presidents, but not the presidency.

115
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,990
我们必须假设这事是真的
We have to assume this is happening.

116
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,090
我们必须在她参选之前就堵死她的路子
We need to end her campaign before it begins.

117
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,750
她履历毫无瑕疵
She's clean.

118
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,270
她就任副检察长时沃克就审查过她
Walker vetted her for Solicitor General,

119
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,010
后任命她为特别检察官时又审过一次
then again when he made her special prosecutor.

120
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,220
正因为这些经历  她才如此受欢迎
That's one of the things that makes her so attractive.

谢谢你  杰姬

如果不能踢她出局
Well, if we can't knock her out,

124
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,340
就必须得另想办法
we have to figure out another way.

125
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,840
很震撼  是不是
It's something, isn't it?

126
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,210
是啊
Yes, it is.

127
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,890
美国一贯不支持向中东地区
Traditionally, the United States has not supported

128
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,790
派驻军队
military action in the Middle East.

129
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,270
但若有一支中立的联合国维和部队进驻约旦河谷
But a neutral UN peacekeeping force in the Jordan Valley

130
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,380
将为构建一个可持续的  长期的和平局势
is an essential first step to sustainable,

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,340
迈出关键的第一步
long-term peace.

132
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,620
美国将赞成这一决议案
The United States will vote "yes."

谢谢您  主席先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

134
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,200
现在有请俄罗斯联邦的代表进行发言
I give the floor to the representative of the Russian Federation.

135
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,080
俄罗斯也致力于维护地区和平稳定
Russia is also committed to stability in the region.

136
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,590
但让联合国介入如此复杂的局势
But inserting the UN into such a complicated situation

137
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,750
将对实质和平造成无可挽回的损害
could irrevocably damage the hopes of real peace.

138
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,650
我强烈建议我的各位同事
I strongly encourage my colleagues

139
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,270

我宣布此决议草案进入表决环节
I put the draft resolution to a vote.

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,750
1票弃权
one abstention.

148
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,700
此项决议草案未获通过
The draft resolution does not pass

149
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,150
因为有安理会常任理事国投反对票
due to the "No" Vote by a permanent member of the Security Council.

150
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,380
我们原本希望俄罗斯能改变心意
We hoped that Russia would change their mind

151
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,190
但他们的否决也在意料之中
but their veto doesn't surprise me...

152
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,840
因此我们需要您协助我们越过安理会
So we need your support to bypass the Security Council.

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,840
我们不想削弱常任理事国的否决权
We don't want to undermine the veto of our permanent members.

154
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,890
我们不会开创这样的危险先例
We will not establish a dangerous precedent.

155
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,270
如果不能取得联大多数赞成  不能推翻否决
The General Assembly can't override the veto without a majority.

156
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,400
以色列仍然支持你们吗
Do you still have the support of Israel?

157
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,840
否则我也不会打给您了
I would not call you if this was not the case.

158
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,690
那只要以色列支持  我方也赞成
Then as long as Israel agrees, we agree.

159
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,880
太好了  谢谢您  大使先生
Wonderful. Thank you Ambassador.

160
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,830
我们决定提交联大投票时会通知您的
I'll let you know when we decide to submit it to a vote.

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,590
伊莉安娜  法国同意了
Ileana, France is in.

162
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,710
我需要确定以色列不会动摇
I need to be certain Israel will stand firm.

163
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,340
以色列不会坚守承诺的
Israel will never maintain its commitment.

164
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,540
以色列和世界上绝大多数国家一样
Israel wants what the rest of the world wants,

165
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,060
都想要长久的安全
sustainable security.

166
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,670
信我一句
Trust me on this,

167
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,100
我在联合国和耶路撒冷打了好多年的交道
I've dealt with Jerusalem for many years at the UN.

168
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,540
一旦局势不利  他们马上就会弃你而去
The moment it gets difficult, they'll turn their back on you.

169
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,910
而局势势必会恶化
And it will get difficult.

170
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,390
你说得对
You're right.

171
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,620
我无法预测未来他们会有什么举动
I can't predict how they will act down the road,

172
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,840
但我知道他们会赞成这项决议案的
but I do know they will vote for this resolution.

173
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,350
拭目以待吧
We'll see.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,650
绕过安理会实在是鲁莽之举
Going around the Security Council is a radical move.

175
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,690
不是鲁莽  是有理有据
It's not radical, it's justified.

176
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,700
你从旧纸堆里翻出60多年前的先例
You dust off some 60-year-old precedent

177
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,020
还觉得是有理有据
and think you're justified?

178
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,710
第377号决议案发动了一场战争
The Uniting for Peace resolution was used to start a war.

179
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,490
那是为了阻止朝鲜的进攻
To end North Korea's aggression.

180
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,510
文字游戏而已
Semantics.

181
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,660
已经有93个国家支持这个决议案
Ninety-three nations on board already,

182
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,820
还包括以色列  这可不是文字游戏
including Israel, that's not semantics.

183
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,440
克莱尔  克里姆林宫给了我很大的压力
Claire, I'm getting a lot of pressure from the Kremlin.

184
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,010
佩特罗夫不想闹到联合国大会上去
Petrov doesn't want this to go to the General Assembly.

185
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,000
再给我点时间说服他
Give me a little more time to work on him.

186
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,370
已经给你一个月了  我们要行动了
We've given you a month. We're moving forward.

187
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,890
什么事
Yes?

188
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,310
邓巴女士来了
Ms. Dunbar is here.

189
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,370
让她进来
Send her in.

190
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,450
希瑟
Heather.

191
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,660
总统先生
Mr. President.

192
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,810
我听了你今早辩护的音频
I listened to the audio of your defense this morning.

193
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,100
表现很出色
It was outstanding.

194
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,610
您说得没错  要打感情牌
You were right about making the emotional argument.

195
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,040
我觉得这能让国家伤愈  请坐
I think it will help the country heal. Please, have a seat.

196
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,160
我今晚还准备私下见默罕默德先生
I'm also going to meet later tonight with Mr. Mahmoud privately.

197
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,220
亲自向他道歉
To personally apologize.

198
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,410
这么做很有同情心
That's a compassionate thing to do.

199
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,890
听你辩护时  我还注意到
When I listened to your argument, I also heard something else.

200
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,290
雅各布斯法官曾质询你
There was a moment when Justice Jacobs

201
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,570
无人机袭击的事
was asking you about drone strikes.

202
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,920
是  我记得
Yeah, I remember.

203
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,890
他停顿了...非常久
And he paused... for quite a long time.

204
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,860
我觉得  他只是一时卡壳了
I think... he just lost his train of thought.

205
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,660
好吧
Well...

206
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,630
接下来我说的  一定要保密
What I'm about to tell you has to remain between us.

207
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,650
没问题
Of course.

208
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,220
雅各布斯法官有老年痴呆
Justice Jacobs has Alzheimer's.

209
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,940
几个月前他告诉了我
He came to me a few months ago to tell me.

210
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,680
现在还是早期
Now, it's in the early stages,

211
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,850
除非有意观察  不然发现不了
so you wouldn't even notice unless you know what to look for.

212
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,080
他还想待在法庭上吗
He wants to remain on the court?

213
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,280
我要说的就是这个
Well, that's what I want to discuss.

214
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,500
他想退休
He wanted to retire.

215
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,970
我叫他再多等会儿
I asked him to hold on just a little while longer,

216
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,690
让我先找到合适的人选  现在我找到了
until I could find a suitable replacement and now I have.

217
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,620
我觉得...你最合适
And I want that replacement... to be you.

218
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,060
你意下如何
What do you think?

219
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,470
我...自愧不配  先生
I'm... humbled, sir.

220
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,090
您愿考虑我  我着实震惊
And... honestly surprised that you'd consider me.

221
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,480
为什么
Why is that?

222
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,010
因为以前的纠葛
Given our history.

223
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,750
我说过那些都过去了  就都过去了
When I said that was water under the bridge, I meant it.

224
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,940
你有我国最强的法律头脑
You have the finest legal mind in this country,

225
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,130
对宪法理解很透彻
a deep understanding of the Constitution,

226
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,540
共和党不敢阻止你提名
and the Republicans wouldn't dare block your nomination.

227
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,750
毕竟你检举过民主党的总统
After all, you prosecuted a Democratic president.

228
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,080
当副检察长屈才了
You're too good to be Solicitor General.

229
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,480
你要拿稳这个铁饭碗
Let's make sure you have a job for life.

230
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,440
很感激您这么说  先生
I appreciate you saying that, sir.

231
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,870
抱歉
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,840
容我再考虑考虑
This is a lot to process.

233
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,270
大选前就要搞定这事
It's important we do this before the election.

234
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,930
共和党人当了总统就没准了
We could end up with a Republican president.

235
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,100
除非你真想坐这个位置
And I don't want to suggest your name to Jacobs

236
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,310
不然我不会向雅各布斯提你的名
unless you truly want the position.

237
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,460
所以...现在就告诉我
So... I need to know now.

238
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,920
好  我非常荣幸
Yes. It would be a great honor.

239
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,550
很好  祝贺你
Good. Congratulations.

240
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,350
你去告诉家人  我去跟雅各布斯说
You speak to your family. I'll speak to Jacobs.

241
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,860
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

242
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,350
你看到了吗
Did you see this?

243
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:22,860
看到什么
See what?

244
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,180
我刚收到警告了
I just got an alert.

245
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,760
不知道  我好一阵没见到吉姆了
I don't know. I haven't, uh... seen Jim in a while.

246
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,180
真奇怪
That's weird.

247
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,850
我想向你做出最诚挚的抱歉
I want to offer you my sincerest regret.

248
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,010
希望你能够接受
And I hope that you will accept my apology.

249
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,750
抱歉  我做不到
I'm sorry, but I can't.

250
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,840
我知道应该早点道歉的
I know it should have come sooner.

251
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,630
监督必须更严格
There needs to be more oversight.

252
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,440
有美国国会监督呢
Well, there is congressional oversight.

253
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,420
还有严格的制度来防止附带伤亡
We have a rigorous system to prevent collateral damage.

254
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,170
平民被列为"其他激进分子"
Civilians are listed as "other militants."

255
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,010
但政府并未提供确凿证据
But the government offers no evidence that's true.

256
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,730
反正就我而言是没有
It definitely wasn't in my case.

257
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,860
你们的程序哪里严格了
How rigorous can your process be?

258
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,840
平民死于无人机袭击的数目
The numbers of non-combatants who are being killed by drone strikes

259
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,040
比以往少多了
is lower than it's ever been.

260
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,920
这些数字是假的
Those numbers are false.

261
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,510
2010年只死了一个平民  肯定不对
One civilian killed in 2010? That has to be wrong.

262
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,840
听着  我不认为五角大楼对此说了实话
Look, I don't think the Pentagon is being honest about--

263
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,870
你没事吧
Are you okay?

264
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,030
我去叫医生
I'll get the doctor up here.

265
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,270
不必了  过一会儿就好
Don't do that. It'll pass.

266
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,160
幻痛而已
Phantom pain.

267
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,240
你知道我来时想做什么吗
You know what I dreamed of when I came here?

268
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,610
徒手掐死你
Choking you with my bare hands.

269
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,640
默罕默德先生  你可以恨我
Mr. Mahmoud, you may hate me.

270
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,400
恨我的职位
You may hate the office I hold.

271
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,840
但现实是
But here's the reality:

272
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,650
每天我必须做出我但愿是正确的决定
I must make decisions every day that I hope are just.

273
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,210
我也不能一直明辨是非
I don't know right from wrong all the time.

274
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,670
我倒希望我能
I wish I did.

275
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,740
但我决不能优柔寡断
But what I can't be is indecisive.

276
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,460
《古兰经》中说  "夺一无辜之人性命
It says in the Qur'an: "The taking of one innocent life

277
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,450
如了结全人类之性命"
is like the taking of all mankind."

278
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,930
不过它也说  "救人一命
It also says that "The saving of one life

279
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,280
如保全人类之命"
is like the saving of all mankind."

280
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,980
你把我叫来  不是想跟我道歉
You didn't ask me here to apologize.

281
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,390
而是想让我原谅你
You asked me here to forgive you.

282
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,730
那袭击不是我下的命令
I didn't order the strike that--

283
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,950
我不会原谅你  总统先生
I won't forgive you, Mr. President.

284
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,680
我不想让你夜里能安心入睡
I don't want to make it any easier for you to sleep at night.

285
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,420
知道《古兰经》的只字片语也不能免除你的罪孽
And knowing a few lines of the Qur'an does not absolve you.

286
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,700
我对这个国家负有责任  默罕默德先生
I have a duty to this nation, Mr. Mahmoud.

287
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,030
我发过誓的
I swore an oath.

288
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,060
责任和谋杀之间有道微妙的界线
There's a fine line between duty and murder.

289
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,460
只有你有能力阻止我遭遇的事
Only you have the power to stop what happened to me.

290
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,220
下次你使用这份权力时  希望你能三思
The next time you wield it... I hope you'll think twice.

291
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,670
一定会的  密查姆
Yes, of course. Meechum!

292
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,970
先生  怎么了
Yes, sir?

293
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,850
把默罕默德先生送出去
You show Mr. Mahmoud out.

294
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,590
全国范围内持续两个月的随机抽样
Two months of random sampling across the country.

295
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,440
不到所有可用数据的千分之一
Less than a tenth of a percent of all incoming data.

296
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,240
怎么这么少
Why so little?

297
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,280
你知道我们监视着多少个摄像机吗
You have any idea how many cameras we monitor?

298
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,710
华盛顿所有主机的CPU核心份额
The CPU core quota of every mainframe in Washington

299
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,300
都处理不了全部数据
couldn't handle all that data.

300
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,720
我企图加倍样本范围但是触发了警报
I tried doubling the sample range and it set off alarms.

301
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,580
我就差这么一点被抓
I came this fucking close to getting caught.

302
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,200
我们只能缩小搜索范围
Okay, we just need to narrow the search, man.

303
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,220
要覆盖的范围太广了
It's too much ground to cover.

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,860
怎么缩小
How?

305
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,060
我需要更多关于瑞秋的信息
I need more information on Rachel.

306
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,130
她喜欢的书  电影之类的  什么都行
Favorite books, fuckin' movies. Anything.

307
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,810
我一无所知
I don't know.

308
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,800
拜托  她提起过去哪里吗
Come on. Did she ever talk about going anywhere?

309
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,820
去什么地方旅游之类的
Traveling to some place?

310
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,390
没有  她那时不能去旅游
No. Traveling wasn't an option.

311
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,320
我需要更多信息
I need more, man.

312
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,210
那另一个女孩丽萨呢
What about the other girl? Lisa.

313
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,150
我正在看她的电子邮件
I'm reading her e-mails.

314
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,000
并追踪了她的手机  什么也没发现
I'm tracking her phone. There's nothing there.

315
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,220
但我们可以接近她  跟她谈谈
We should get close to her, though. We should talk to her.

316
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,140
问出点有用的东西
Extract something.

317
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,320
她会认出我来的
She might recognize me.

318
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,230
我来吧
I'll do it.

319
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,550
这叫我紧张
That makes me nervous.

320
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,480
社会工程而已  我可以"黑"她的回忆
It's social engineering. I'll just hack her that way.

321
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,920
她一点也不会起疑的
She won't suspect a thing.

322
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,490
如果我们不试点新办法就找不到瑞秋
If we don't try something new, we're not gonna find Rachel.

323
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,880
吃点煮花生吧
Help yourself to some boiled peanuts.

324
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,270
不了  谢谢  盐太多了
No, thank you. Too much salt.

325
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,800
我来这儿的第一周
First week I was here,

326
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,310
我问服务员能不能给我来点煮花生
I asked one of the stewards if I could have some boiled peanuts.

327
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,170
我小的时候经常吃
I used to eat them all the time as a kid,

328
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,440
从那以后的每一天
and I'll be damned if there hasn't been

329
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,820
我都要满满一碗的煮花生
a full bowl of peanuts here every day since.

330
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,740
他们肯定有口昼夜不停煮花生的锅
They must have a pot boiling 'round the clock.

331
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,080
露丝现在让我吃甘蓝脆片
Ruth has me eating kale crisps now.

332
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,490
说对身体好  我受不了那东西
Says they're good for me. I can't stand the things.

333
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,810
我让厨房给剥好了皮
I have them shucked in the kitchen,

334
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,550
这样吃的时候不会弄脏手指
so you don't even have to get your fingers dirty.

335
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,040
随意吃  享受一下生活
Feel free. Live a little.

336
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,540
大法官先生  我们上次谈完后
Mr. Justice, since we last spoke,

337
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,140
我做了很多反省
I've done a lot of soul searching.

338
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,740
我要求你继续做法官  这不该
It was unfair of me to ask you to stay on the bench.

339
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,980
如果你想退休  就可以退休
If you want to retire, you should.

340
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,340
感谢您的考虑  总统先生
I appreciate your consideration, Mr. President.

341
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,860
我认为我首先该做的
Well, I thought the first thing I should do

342
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,160
就是找到一名合适的继任者
is to find a suitable successor.

343
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,610
一个你会认可  能让你放心的人
Someone you would approve of to put your mind at ease,

344
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,210
我想我找到了
and I think I've found one.

345
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,070
是谁
Who?

346
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,320
希瑟·邓巴
Heather Dunbar.

347
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,760
我觉得她会是位很棒的法官
I think she'd be an excellent justice.

348
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,160
很高兴你同意选她
I'm glad you agree.

349
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,760
只是没想到会选她  毕竟她...
Just an unlikely choice, given how vociferous she--

350
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,580
在沃克调查中咄咄逼人  是的
With the Walker investigation, yes.

351
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,100
但那只会增加我对她的尊重
But that only increases my estimation of her.

352
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,020
她很有责任感
She has a great sense of duty.

353
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,050
比我共事过的任何副检察长都有责任心
More than any Solicitor General I've ever worked with.

354
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,680
真希望我早能知道您找我来的原因
I wish I'd known the reason you invited me beforehand.

355
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,400
就可以免去这趟麻烦了
I could have saved you the trouble.

356
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,300
为什么呢
Why?

357
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,790
我几个月前跟您聊过之后
After I talked to you a couple of months ago,

358
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,090
露丝说您是给了我一份礼物
Ruth said you'd given me a gift.

359
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,380
如果我不当法官  会很痛苦
That I would be miserable if I weren't on the bench.

360
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,850
她跟我儿子都谈了  他们也同意
She talked to my sons and they all agreed.

361
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,740
只要我的健康还允许
As long as I'm well enough to serve the court,

362
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,200
我就想继续做下去
that's where I want to be.

363
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,550
我们留意着点2016的走势
And we'll keep an eye on 2016.

364
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,050
如果共和党看上去能赢  我就辞职
If it looks as though the Republicans will win, I'll step down.

365
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,200
如果不会  我就留下  但不用着急
If not, I'll stay. But, there's no rush.

366
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,630
我非得毁掉这个人吗
Must I destroy this man?

367
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,450
总统先生
Mr. President?

368
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,950
不  我不想
No. I won't.

369
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,150
您说什么
Excuse me?

370
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,480
我不能袖手旁观
I won't stand by

371
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,590
看你做这个错误的决定
and watch you make this mistake.

372
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,400
我已经考虑好了
I've thought this through.

373
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,520
我们不是朋友  罗伯特
We're not friends, Robert.

374
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,080
我们没那么熟
We don't know each other that well.

375
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,580
但我关心你
But I care about you.

376
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,390
因为你在法院服务了超过20年
Because you served for more than 20 years on the bench.

377
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,220
你裁定的判例存世会比你我都长久
You've established legal precedents that will outlive both of us.

378
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,130
而且...
And...

379
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,420
昨天的事你也许可以用人老糊涂解释过去
maybe you can explain away yesterday as a senior moment.

380
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,620
但要是再出现你没法解释的其他状况呢
But what if another moment happens that you can't explain away?

381
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,170
万一你患病的消息泄露出去了呢
What if somehow the news of your illness leaks?

382
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,700
那你写下的每个判决都会受人怀疑
Then every decision you've written will be called into question.

383
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,900
都将受到质疑
They'll be challenged.

384
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,400
你一生的成果瞬间就会化为乌有
And a life's work will be undone in a heartbeat.

385
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,420
您有什么其他心思吗
Do you have some ulterior motive here?

386
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,580
只是为你着想
Only your best interests.

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,430
那为什么要这么急
But why the urgency?

388
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,160
我想保护你
I want to protect you.

389
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,160
大法官  我在请求你  在恳求你
Justice, I'm asking you, I'm pleading with you.

390
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,650
别让事情脱离你的掌控
Don't let events get out of your control.

391
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,720
你能重新考虑吗
Will you reconsider?

392
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,480
谢谢您的关心  总统先生
I appreciate your concern, Mr. President.

393
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,940
我再跟露丝商量一下  给您答复
Let me speak again to Ruth and I'll get back to you.

394
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,070
谢谢你  大法官
Thank you, Justice.

395
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,690
你这是禁言
It's a moratorium.

396
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,040
我们不那么叫
We're not calling it that.

397
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,930
随你们叫什么  但没人开口
Call it whatever you want, nobody's talking.

398
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,890
我们在避免发布错误信息
We're trying to prevent misinformation.

399
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,810
我本想写《美就法》的报道
I'm supposed to write about AmWorks.

400
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,880
但行政部门都
How can I do that  when no one

401
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,900
没人跟我说话我该怎么写
from the executive branch will speak to me?

402
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,840
国会那边情况瞬息万变
This thing's shifting under our feet in Congress.

403
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,420
等我写完早简报  已经成了昨日黄花
By the time I finish the morning brief, it's already outdated.

404
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,080
我不是要求跟总统一对一对话  但...
I'm not asking for a one-on-one with the president, but...

405
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,990
但劳工部长  财政部长
the Secretary of Labor, Treasury,

406
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,340
他的哪个经济顾问都行
one of his economic advisors.

407
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,870
给你特殊待遇吗
Give you special treatment?

408
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,040
我觉得你们下令禁言是因为你们要输
I think you issued the moratorium because you're losing the battle.

409
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,030
事关五千亿美金
It's 500 billion dollars.

410
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,410
这是罗斯福新政以来最大的就业计划
This is the largest jobs program since the New Deal.

411
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,350
当然是场激战  但那不代表我们失利
Of course it's a slugfest. That doesn't mean we're losing.

412
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,740
那让我跟能确证那点的人谈谈
Then let me speak to someone who can confirm that.

413
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,180
因为我从共和党人那里听到的
Because all I'm hearing from the Republicans is that

414
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,790
都是《美就法》绝对不会通过
AmWorks will never see the light of day.

415
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,140
我很同情你  艾拉
I sympathize with you, Ayla.

416
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,090
我也希望能让你如愿
I wish I could give you what you want.

417
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,720
总统要我们过去
The president needs us.

418
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,550
我们迟点再聊
So we'll talk later.

419
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,740
迈克尔·科里根  上周国宴时
Michael Corrigan, the activist who organized the protest

420
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,230
组织抗议的激进分子
at the state dinner last month,

421
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,810
三小时前在莫斯科被俄国警方逮捕
arrested by Russian police three hours ago in Moscow.

422
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,570
视频已经疯传
The video is going viral.

423
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,940
他是国内外知名的同性恋权利活动家
He's a high profile gay rights activist, nationally and abroad.

424
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,400
过去六周以来他一直在俄罗斯高调活动
And he's been very vocal in Russia over the last six weeks.

425
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,110
这是联调局关于他的档案  先生
Here's the bureau file on him, sir.

426
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,920
我们跟克里姆林宫接触了吗
Have we been in touch with the Kremlin?

427
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,380
杜兰特国务卿现在正在丹吉尔[摩洛哥城市]
Secretary Durant is in Tangier right now.

428
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,300
我打电话知会了她  她也联系了布加耶夫
I briefed her by phone and she reached out to Bugayev.

429
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,200
但他们还没有联系上
But they have not connected yet.

430
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,720
格莱姆斯大使也在莫斯科上下疏通
Ambassador Grimes is making calls in Moscow,

431
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,750
但目前没有进展
but nobody's engaging,

432
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,710
只知道他们打算提出严重的指控
other than to say they plan on fully prosecuting him.

433
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,190
大使  你认为这会不会是对你在联合国
Ambassador, do you think this could be in retaliation

434
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,770
活动的报复行为
for what you're doing at the UN?

435
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,920
有这个可能
It could be.

436
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,100
俄罗斯人对这个决议案非常不满
The Russians are very upset about this resolution.

437
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,310
我去莫里科夫那里探探口风
I'll see what I can find out from Moryakov.

438
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,160
把新闻发布会推迟到明天
Let's hold off on the press conference until tomorrow.

439
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,340
我希望能汇报些好消息  而不是两手空空
I'd like to deliver some good news instead of no news.

440
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,170
同时
In the meantime,

441
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,610
发一个声明  说我们正在接触莫斯科方面
put out a statement that we're in communication with Moscow.

442
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,460
我们正竭尽所能
And that we're doing everything we can

443
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,480
把科里根先生营救回美国  谢谢各位
to get Mr. Corrigan back to the United States. Thank you all.

444
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,670
我个人也讨厌这套法律
Personally, I hate the law.

445
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,780
古板又恐同的玩意
It's medieval homophobic nonsense.

446
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,930
但法律就是法律
But it's the law.

447
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,210
我们刚刚谈过
I don't think it's coincidence

448
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,530
科里根就被逮捕了  我不觉得是巧合
that Corrigan was arrested after our conversation.

449
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,450
我也不觉得是巧合
Well, I wouldn't think it was a coincidence either.

450
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,330
那你有什么期望
So what do you hope to achieve?

451
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,450
我的期望和你一样  让科里根先生获释
The same thing as you do: Mr. Corrigan's release.

452
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,180
前提是我撤回决议案
If I withdraw the resolution.

453
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,030
我认为莫斯科肯定会将此举视为善意的表示
I think Moscow would certainly see it as a sign of goodwill.

454
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,060
我们可不会为了表示善意
Well, we don't barter goodwill

455
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,610
就拿美国公民的自由做交易
for the freedom of American citizens.

456
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,800
我提议过将他立即驱逐出境
I actually advocated for his immediate deportation.

457
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
我也认为把他扔进大牢只能适得其反
I agree that tossing him in jail is counterproductive,

458
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,830
但高层心意已决
but my superiors are adamant.

459
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
帮佩特罗夫看清局势吧
Save Petrov from himself.

460
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,730
我可没资格质疑他
It's not my place to question him.

461
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,640
和你不同  我毕竟没嫁给总统
Unlike you, I'm not married to my boss.

462
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,160
我会把克里姆林宫的立场转达给总统
I'll relay the Kremlin's position to the president.

463
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,210
如果我们让步  约旦河谷计划就搁浅了
If we give in, the Jordan Valley plan is over

464
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,990
还让俄罗斯人觉得他们可以漫天要价
and we show the Russians we can be blackmailed.

465
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,280
难道我们眼睁睁让科里根坐穿牢底吗
So we're just supposed to let Corrigan rot away?

466
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,630
我想如果我们在联合国保持强硬立场
I think if we continue to drive hard at the UN,

467
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,870
我们就会有更多筹码
we'll gain leverage.

468
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,160
凯茜怎么想
What does Cathy think?

469
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,830
她也同意
She agrees.

470
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,000
只要科里根一天没放出来  我就得挨一天骂
I'm gonna take flak every day that Corrigan remains in jail.

471
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,740
如果你退步的话就会被骂死
And you'll take more if you back down.

472
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,510
但这样一来我就得在新闻发布会上
But it does mean I have to get in front of the press

473
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,700
两手空空地面对媒体
with absolutely nothing of substance to say.

474
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,070
你在国会混了20年  没话找话你最拿手
You spent 20 years in Congress. You're good at that.

475
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,340
听到你笑真好
It's good to hear you laugh.

476
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,540
睡一会儿吧  我明天再打给你
Get some sleep. I'll call you tomorrow.

477
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,480
晚安
Good night.

478
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,850
具体是谁负责华盛顿和莫斯科之间的沟通
Who specifically is communicating between Washington and Moscow?

479
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,960
两国之间的联络是由国务院
All of our communication is between the State Department

480
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,350
和俄罗斯外交部负责的  艾拉
and the Russian Foreign Ministry. Ayla.

481
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,300
您在声明中一直称这是侵犯言论自由
In your statement, you persisted in calling this a free speech issue,

482
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,590
但同性恋权利难道不也是主题吗
but isn't gay rights really at the center of this?

483
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,920
科里根先生是因为自由发表意见被捕的
Well, Mr. Corrigan was arrested for speaking his mind.

484
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,710
无论他是持什么立场
No matter what his opinions...

485
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,010
您是不是在回避问题  总统先生
Aren't you skirting that, Mr. President,

486
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,160
因为您在同性恋权利问题上立场含混不清
because your stance on gay rights is unclear?

487
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,060
现在清楚无疑的是科里根先生的被捕不公正
What is clear is that Mr. Corrigan's detainment is unjust

488
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,190
而如我所言  我们正动用一切手段
and, as I said, we're doing everything we can

489
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,980
确保他安全回家  扎克利
to make sure that he can come home. Yes, Zachary.

490
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,740
我还没问完
Following up.

491
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,310
如果您不参选  那么回避同性恋问题
Isn't dodging gay rights a calculated move

492
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,140
是不是太过算计了
for a man not running for office?

493
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,930
你说我在回避问题
You think I'm dodging?

494
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,200
那我今天就把话跟你说清楚
Well, then let me be as clear as I possibly can be.

495
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,150
同性恋群体是有权利的
Gay people have rights.

496
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,190
而本届政府始终坚信
And this administration has always believed

497
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,520
科里根先生有权就任何问题
that Mr. Corrigan has the right to speak his mind

498
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,050
自由表达观点  而无需担心被捕
without fear of being arrested on any issue,

499
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,250
不管是同性恋权利还是别的什么
whether it's gay rights or something else.

500
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,550
另一件清楚无疑的事
And what is also quite clear

501
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,670
就是你在礼仪课上肯定没好好听讲
is that you must have failed etiquette class.

502
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,920
扎克利
Yes, Zachary.

503
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,520
-总统先生  -您为什么不接见约翰·帕斯特纳克
- Mr. Prisident-- - Why won't you speak to John Pasternak,

504
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,180
-迈克尔·科里根的丈夫  -萨伊德女士
- Michael Corrigan's husband? - Ms. Sayyad,

505
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,920
今天到场的还有其他记者和媒体
there are other members of the press here today,

506
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,570
帕斯特纳克先生一直在试图联系白宫
Mr. Pasternak has been trying to contact the White House

507
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,760
但却没人理他
and no one will speak with him.

508
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,080
实在抱歉各位  我还有会
I do apologize, I have a meeting.

509
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,720
真希望能回答你们所有人的问题
I wish I could've gotten to all your questions.

510
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,140
还有任何疑问的话
But if you have any further inquiries,

511
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,270
请问格雷森先生  非常感谢
please direct them to Mr. Grayson. Thank you very much.

512
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,530
抱歉  先生
I apologize, sir.

513
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,380
你太过分了
You went too far.

514
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,480
那是我的工作
I did my job.

515
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,040
这是有规则的  要顾及礼仪
There's protocol. There's basic decorum.

516
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,070
那这样  你为我解除《美就法》的禁言
How about this: you lift the moratorium for me on AmWorks,

517
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,780
我消失五周  专心酝酿长文
I disappear for five weeks. Focus on my long-lead piece.

518
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,270
科里根和其他事我都不碰
I don't touch Corrigan or anything else.

519
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,920
你就指望我来警告你
You wanted me to chew you out.

520
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,020
如果能让你开口的话
If that's what it takes to get us talking.

521
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,090
所以我要收回你的白宫记者证
Which is why I need your credential.

522
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,850
-什么  -你的白宫记者证
- What? - Your credential.

523
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,630
-你开玩笑吧  -我笑了吗
- You're kidding. - Do you see me laughing?

524
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,880
你无权收回我的白宫记者证
You don't control my credential.

525
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,670
白宫记者协会才有权
The Correspondents' Association does.

526
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,310
我刚跟乔尔·维曼聊过
And I just spoke to Joel Weinmann.

527
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,450
他不会的
He wouldn't.

528
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,160
你成功了  艾拉
You succeeded, Ayla.

529
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,130
我要为所有
I'm lifting the moratorium

530
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,540
其他记者解除《美就法》的禁言
for every other member of the press corps.

531
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,140
代价是你的白宫记者证
The price was your credential.

532
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,370
他没有理由
He has no grounds.

533
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,180
你对总统不敬
You disrespected the president,

534
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,670
对政府不敬  更对你的同行们不敬
the office, and most importantly, your fellow colleagues.

535
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,250
根本不难说服他
It wasn't a tough sell.

536
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,810
那我下一篇报道就写这个
Then this becomes my next story.

537
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,270
迫害记者  上下勾结  尽职却付出代价
Punishing a member of the press. Collusion. Pay for play.

538
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
我会否认
And I'll deny.

539
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,050
而且你觉得记者协会主席
And do you think the head of the association

540
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,460
会承认吗
is gonna admit anything?

541
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,410
艾拉  你两边都没有盟友了
You don't have any friends, Ayla, on either side of the fence.

542
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,690
总统刚就言论自由发表了声明
The president just made a statement about free speech.

543
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,960
你就要把记者踢出白宫吗
Now you're gonna start kicking reporters out of the White House?

544
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,860
-不  只踢你  -不只是我
- No. Just you. - No, not just me!

545
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,730
你惹上了全美第二大日报
You're fucking with the second largest daily in America.

546
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,330
你能甩掉我
You can get rid of me,

547
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,600
但甩不掉我工作的报社
but you can't get rid of the institution I work for.

548
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,840
说完了吗
You done?

549
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,960
别一时得权就昏了头  赛斯
Don't let your 15 minutes of power go to your head, Seth.

550
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,680
封壳你留着做纪念吧
You can keep the plastic if you want... as a souvenir.

551
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,880
反正也只能作纪念了
That's all it's good for, now.

552
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,550
你好
Hello?

553
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,400
嗯
Yeah.

554
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,080
真的吗
Are you serious?

555
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,700
好吧
Okay.

556
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,870
操
Fuck.

557
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,970
我有事找总统
I need to speak to the president.

558
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,450
我们希望通过法律完善政府
Through our laws, we seek to create a more perfect union.

559
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,900
滥用法律的政府官员
Government officials who abuse the law,

560
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,480
或者哪怕是
or, at the very least,

561
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
打法律的擦边球  借机牟利的人
exploit the edges of it for their own personal gain,

562
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,850
都是在玷污民主  削弱这个伟大的国家
tarnish our democracy and weaken the bonds of our great nation.

563
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,350
民主党必须走出丑闻的阴影
The Democratic Party must step out of the shadow of scandal

564
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,120
改头换面
and redefine itself.

565
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,960
她演完了让她来一趟
I want her here when she's done with this stunt.

566
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,990
迎接一个透明  真诚  正义的新时代
Embracing a new era of transparency, honesty and justice,

567
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,190
这个国家需要一位曾在全美诸多法庭里
this country deserves a president who has dedicated herself

568
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,630
为这个理想献身的总统
to those ideals in this court and many others,

569
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,340
一位毕生都在捍卫法律的总统
who has spent her entire life defending the law,

570
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,120
一位如今想投入法律执行的总统
and who now wants to dedicate herself to enforcing it.

571
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,930
迎接一位正直的总统吧
Let's restore integrity to the Oval Office.

572
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,700
用总统的权力根除腐败  以身作则
Use its power to root out corruption and lead by example.

573
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,160
今天  在家人和朋友面前
Today, before my family and friends,

574
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:54,240
在上帝和美国最高法院面前
my God, and the highest court in our land,

575
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,150
我宣布参选
I announce my candidacy

576
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,290
美利坚合众国总统
for President of the United States of America.

577
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,490
邓巴女士此次宣布参选
There was no indication Ms. Dunbar

578
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,450
并没有任何先兆
had plans to run for president.

579
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,470
她将成为史上第二位
This will make her the second Solicitor General

580
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,180
参选总统的副检察长
in history to run for president,

581
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,190
另一位是1908年的威廉·霍华德·塔夫特
the only other being William Howard Taft in 1908.

582
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,720
安德伍德总统已经宣布不会...
With President Underwood declaring he will not--

583
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,620
-总统先生  -邓巴女士
- Mr. President. - Ms. Dunbar.

584
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,530
请坐吧
Please, take a seat.

585
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,550
我的辞呈
My letter of resignation.

586
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,910
我不能接受
I can't accept that.

587
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,230
你对我们太重要了
You're too valuable to us.

588
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,660
我要竞选就得离职
I can't run for office as Solicitor General.

589
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,360
那你该重新考虑下竞选的事
Then you should reconsider running for office.

590
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,870
现在已经太迟了
It's too late for that, I think.

591
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,280
我不理解  希瑟
I don't understand, Heather.

592
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,230
我给了你最高法院的位置
I offered you a seat on the Supreme Court.

593
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,750
前提是雅各布斯辞职  但他不会
If Jacobs was stepping down, which he isn't.

594
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,620
你跟他谈过
You spoke to him.

595
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,480
作为副检察长  我跟每位法官关系都很好
As Solicitor General, I'm friendly with all the justices.

596
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,280
我没有声张那些关系
I keep those relationships private

597
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,950
免得人怀疑法官对我有偏袒
so no one will suspect any bias toward me.

598
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,630
但罗伯特跟我关系很好
But Robert and I are very close.

599
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,260
他和露丝每月都邀我去吃顿晚饭
He and Ruth have me over for dinner once a month.

600
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,610
所以你早知道他患病的事了
So you already knew about the Alzheimer's?

601
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,540
确诊当天他就告诉我了
He told me the day he was diagnosed.

602
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,240
我一向是为他的利益考虑
I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.

603
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,710
你并不关心罗伯特
You don't care about Robert.

604
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,800
你只是想让我出局
You wanted to sideline me.

605
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,550
那么你真觉得你有机会进这间办公室
So you actually think you have a shot at this office?

606
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,260
是的  党内领导层也这么觉得
Yes, I do. And so does the leadership.

607
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,280
你是不自量力  希瑟
You're in over your head, Heather,

608
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,790
无论博奇和乌麦克跟你说了什么
no matter what Birch and Womack are telling you.

609
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,520
你在乎什么呢  总统先生
Why should it concern you, Mr. President?

610
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,340
你已经宣布不参加竞选了
You've announced that you're not running.

611
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,120
你参选有个人感情因素吗
Is this personal for you?

612
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,460
别自作多情了
Don't flatter yourself.

613
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,650
你整倒了沃克  但你打不倒我
You got Walker, but you couldn't get me.

614
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,560
我没必要通过竞选来把你赶走
I don't have to run to make sure you leave office.

615
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,790
你本来就赢不了
You couldn't win anyway.

616
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,290
我参选是因为我知道我能做个好总统
I'm running because I know I'd make a good president.

617
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,600
你很可能能当个好总统
You might very well make a good president.

618
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,710
但现在  你是在妄想
But right now, you're being delusional.

619
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,940
博奇来找我时  我还不确定
When Birch approached me, I wasn't sure.

620
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,400
我很动心  但也知道成功机会不大
I was tempted, but I knew it was a long shot.

621
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,660
你给我提名时  我完全不知所措了
And when you offered the nomination, I was overwhelmed.

622
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,870
那是我毕生工作的目标
It's what I'd been working toward my entire career.

623
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,710
但后来我跟罗伯特聊了聊
But then I spoke to Robert.

624
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,620
他告诉我你是怎么威胁他后
And when he told me how you threatened him,

625
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,210
我就知道我必须参选
I knew I had to run.

626
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,260
总得有人把这个办公室里的臭气洗洗干净
Someone needs to scrub the stink from this office.

627
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,600
我没有威胁他
I didn't threaten him.

628
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,400
那你管那叫什么
What would you call it?

629
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,200
我是想挽救他
I was trying to save him,

630
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,570
就像我现在也是想挽救你
in the same way I'm trying to save you now.

631
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,620
一旦他患病的消息泄露  这总会泄露的
Once the news of his Alzheimer's gets out, which it will,

632
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,890
因为无论我们怎么说谎隐瞒
because no matter how much we all try to lie about it,

633
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,030
它总会传出去
it's gonna leak,

634
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,950
你能想象那对他的名誉会造成多大影响吗
can you imagine what that's going to do to his reputation?

635
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,390
他不该遭此境遇
He deserves better than that.

636
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,030
你也该得到比陪跑更高的地位
And you deserve better than being an also-ran.

637
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,500
帮我说服他
Help me convince him.

638
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,390
接受最高法院你应得的那个职位
Take the seat on the court where you belong.

639
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,910
你就是这么说服自己的吗
Is this how you live with yourself?

640
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,460
把不堪的目的说成好听的
By rationalizing the obscene into the palatable?

641
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,030
我还没允许你走
I haven't excused you yet.

642
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,260
爱荷华初选见吧
See you in Iowa.

643
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,370
没有信仰
I wouldn't have made it

644
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,570
我是支撑不过这八个月的
through the past eight months without my faith.

645
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,890
但没有这个团体  我也支撑不过来
But I wouldn't have made it without this community, either.

646
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,680
在那些艰难的日子里...
And on tough days...

647
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,760
我一直提醒自己这点
I remind myself of that.

648
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,980
我不是一个人
That I'm not alone.

649
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,150
我有你们大家
That I have all of you.

650
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,060
我认为承认这点是很重要的
And I think it's important to acknowledge that.

651
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,330
还有表达感谢
To give thanks.

652
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,680
所以  谢谢你们
So thank you.

653
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,810
谢谢所有人
All of you.

654
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,590
谢谢你们一直都在我身边  在我心里
For always being there. For always being here.

655
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,480
我得走了  再见
I have to go. I'll see you soon.

656
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,070
我只想说一句  你刚才讲的...
I just wanted to say, what you said...

657
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,680
真的让我很受触动  关于团体的
it really connected with me. About community.

658
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,530
-谢谢  -嗯
- Thank you. - Yeah.

659
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,410
我很高兴
I'm glad.

660
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,120
我叫丽萨
I'm Lisa.

661
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,380
我叫麦克斯
Of course. Max.

662
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,860
你是新来的
You're new.

663
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,330
其实是第一次来
It was my first time, actually.

664
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,500
你在附近住吗
Do you live around here?

665
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,220
住陶森市  开车来的
Towson. Just drove up.

666
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,680
你怎么找到我们的
How did you find out about us?

667
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:10,670
网上
Online.

668
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,190
网站
Website.

669
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,860
我就是到处看看
Yeah, I was surfing around, and I was...

670
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,990
在找点东西
I was looking for something and...

671
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,670
-太傻了  -不会的
- It's stupid. - No. No, no.

672
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,910
告诉我吧
Tell me.

673
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,680
好吧  几个月前  一个姑娘
Okay, well, a few months ago, this girl...

674
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,250
其实是我一生挚爱...
the love of my life, actually...

675
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,220
分手了吗
Breakup?

676
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,270
她离开了我
She just left me.

677
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,410
非常突然
Out of the blue.

678
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:43,050
有一天她说结束了  就到此为止了
You know, one day she just said it was over and that was it.

679
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,850
是啊
Yeah.

680
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,380
那很痛苦
That's hard.

681
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,600
不久前我也经历了类似的情况
I went through something similar not that long ago.

682
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,060
真的吗
Oh, really?

683
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,420
其实就是我今晚说的
Sort of what I was talking about tonight

684
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,070
我经历的艰难时期
with the hard time I had been through.

685
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,110
发生了什么
What happened?

686
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,660
老故事了
Ancient history.

687
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,660
哪个男的离开了你吗
A guy left you?

688
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,500
其实是女的
It was a woman.

689
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,990
我想我还没有完全放下  但时间会治愈一切嘛
I guess I'm not completely over it, but time heals, you know?

690
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,000
我得回家了  很高兴认识你  麦克斯
I gotta get home, but it was nice to meet you, Max.

691
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,420
很高兴认识你  丽萨
Nice meeting you, Lisa.

692
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,560
能重新安排一下吗  我看看
Can we reschedule? Let me see.

693
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,820
嗯  能把那个提前半小时吗
Yeah, yeah. Can you move that up by a half an hour?

694
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,790
你好
Hello?

695
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,680
现在方便吗  邓巴女士
Is this a good time, Ms. Dunbar?

696
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,870
你是哪位
Who is this?

697
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,470
道格·斯坦普
Doug Stamper.

698
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,390
你怎么拿到这个号码的
How did you get this number?

699
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,550
拿到号码很简单  你应该问的是
Phone numbers are easy. What you should be asking

700
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,130
我怎么知道你今晚要跟吉阿罗参议员见面
is how I knew you were meeting with Senator Giallo tonight.

701
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,790
回头看走廊
Look down the hallway.

702
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,380
你们先走  我到下面找你们
Go ahead. I'll meet you down there.

703
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,180
好吧
All right.

704
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,080
别过来  待在原地
No. Stay where you are.

705
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,220
我们不能被别人看到在一起
We wouldn't want to be seen together.

706
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,770
总统派你来的吗
Did the president send you?

707
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,840
不是  我们不联系了
No. He and I aren't in touch.

708
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,830
那你为什么来这里
Then why are you here?

709
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,260
你要组竞选团队  我想加入
You're forming your team. I want to be a part of it.

710
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,350
真实原因呢
The real reason.

711
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,120
这就是原因
That is the reason.

712
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,160
他派你来的  别骗我
He sent you. Don't lie to me.

713
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,360
我已经九个月没参与任何事了  邓巴女士
I've been out of the game for nine months, Ms. Dunbar.

714
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,060
我想重回战局
I want to get back in.

715
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,660
你要组建竞选团队
You're forming your team,

716
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,320
我想成为开朝一员
and I want to get in on the ground floor.

717
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,060
光有领导层还不够
The leadership isn't enough.

718
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,700
你还需要基层人士
You need the rank and file.

719
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,090
他们与各市县权力掮客的关系
Their connections to county and municipal power brokers.

720
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,290
从初选开始到全面展开
The chiefs of a thousand kingdoms

721
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,050
每一场选举中的当权人物
in every primary from Iowa to Super Tuesday.

722
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,070
我在党鞭办公室工作了十年
I worked in the whip's office for ten years.

723
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,360
我手上有每个人的资料
I have files on every single member.

724
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:04,740
他们要什么  跟谁睡  中午吃什么
What they want, who they sleep with, what they eat for lunch.

725
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,510
我对你会很有价值
I can be valuable to you.

726
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,790
你怎么知道我今晚要跟吉阿罗见面
How did you know I was meeting with Giallo tonight?

727
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,060
你跟领导层来往密切
You rub shoulders with the leadership.

728
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,380
我跟为他们工作的人来往密切
I rub shoulders with the people who work for them.

729
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,510
考虑一下吧  邓巴女士  我只有这点请求
Think about it, Ms. Dunbar. That's all I ask.

730
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,560
下楼
Going down.

731
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,300
我犯了个错误
I made a mistake.

732
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,550
她在总统办公室里跟我说话的方式
I mean, the way she spoke to me in the Oval,

733
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,170
让我恨不得勒死她
I wanted to strangle her.

734
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,990
她到底在想什么
I mean, what is she thinking?

735
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,900
跟在职总统竞争
Running against an incumbent

736
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,250
我都提出给她最高法的职位了
when I offered her a seat on the court--

737
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,790
博奇向她吹耳边风时  她就决定要参选了
She was going to run the moment Birch whispered in her ear.

738
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,800
人一旦开始想象自己坐在总统办公室里
Once people imagine themselves in the Oval,

739
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,850
就不会再回头了
there's no turning back.

740
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,480
你跟他们一样清楚
You know that as well as anybody.

741
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,950
是我自己的错  不应该给雅各布斯留选择余地
It's my own damn fault. Shouldn't have given Jacobs the choice.

742
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,540
我应该在问她之前就宣布提名
I should've just announced her nomination before I even asked her.

743
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,130
-需要我回家吗  -不用
- Should I come home? - No.

744
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,300
我只需要考虑一下  理清思路
I just need to think. I need to clear my head.

745
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,310
我能做点什么
Tell me what I can do.

746
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,670
我为什么要有所保留
Why did I hold back?

747
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,110
我为什么要对雅各布斯留情
Why did I show Jacobs any mercy?

748
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,380
弗兰西斯  这可不像你的作风
Francis, this doesn't sound like you.

749
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,830
把这些抛在脑后  想想下一步怎么做
Put this behind you. Think about what's next.

750
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,080
是因为默罕默德
It was because of Mahmoud.

751
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,520
我让他影响了我
I let him get to me.

752
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,530
那些士兵灵柩上的国旗
And all those flags on those coffins and those soldiers, whose--

753
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:37,100
我调派  又下葬了他们  是我的...
I deployed and then I buried in the ground. It's my--

754
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,990
别说了  这帮不上忙
Stop it. This isn't doing you any good.

755
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,270
你想谈的话我可以跟你谈
I will talk about this with you if you want,

756
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,590
但我不允许你怀疑自己
but if you're doubting yourself, I can't indulge that.

757
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,100
是啊  你说得对
No, you're right, of course.

758
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,740
明早再谈吧
Well, let's talk in the morning.

759
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,670
-有需要随时找我  -我知道
- I'm here if you need me. - I know.

760
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,540
-晚安  -晚安  弗兰西斯
- Good night. - Good night, Francis.

761
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,960
能帮我接艾迪斯主教吗
Yes, can you reach out to Bishop Eddis for me?

762
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,590
我等着
I'll hold.

763
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,910
谢谢  密查姆
Thank you, Meechum.

764
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,590
-让我们单独谈谈  -好的
- If we can have some privacy. - Yes, sir.

765
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,640
还骑博纳维尔呢
Still riding the Bonneville?

766
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,740
把67款卖了换了派普伯恩  那车不错
Sold the '67 for a Pipeburn. Beautiful bike.

767
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,840
有机会带我兜一圈
You should take me for a spin sometime.

768
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,410
算了吧
I don't think so.

769
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,200
骑那个太找死
They're a death wish.

770
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,200
至少你知道自己能上天堂
At least you know you have a place in heaven.

771
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,500
有什么事  总统先生
What's on your mind, Mr. President?

772
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,960
那天葬礼
The burial the other day.

773
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,740
你谈到了亚伯拉罕和以撒
You talked about Abraham and Isaac.

774
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,490
上帝献出了他唯一的儿子
God giving up his only Son.

775
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,870
就跟你说说
Between you and me,

776
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,280
我在阿灵顿总说那一套
that's the same sermon I always use at Arlington.

777
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,480
安葬的士兵太多
You put enough soldiers in the ground,

778
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,180
就懒得写新悼词了
you get tired of writing new ones.

779
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,070
那是我第一次听
It was the first time I had heard it.

780
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,440
肯定不是最后一次
Won't be the last.

781
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,830
我想理解正义
I want to understand what justice is.

782
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,840
这可不简单
That's a big one.

783
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,360
我知道
I know.

784
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,500
我们的正义是先辈创造的
There's our justice, the kind men create.

785
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,580
以《十诫》之类的戒律为基础
We base it on things like the Ten Commandments.

786
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,870
但文字总有不同的解读方法
But those can be read a million different ways.

787
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,550
"不可杀人"说的倒是很明确
"Thou shalt not kill" seems pretty clear.

788
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,140
说得轻巧  我们不杀人
Who's to say? If we didn't kill,

789
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,850
也许还有别人开杀戒
others would kill instead of us.

790
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,510
《圣经》里谈了许多杀戮的故事
There's a lot of killing in the Bible.

791
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,960
大卫王就是位勇士
King David was a warrior.

792
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,870
那怎么用上帝给摩西的《十诫》解释他的行为呢
How do you reconcile that with the laws that God gave Moses?

793
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,990
《十诫》也可以有不同解读
Even those laws require interpretation.

794
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,590
有两条一定要记牢
There are two laws we have to remember above all else.

795
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,040
他要我们爱上帝
He tells us to love God

796
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,660
还要互敬互爱
and to love each other.

797
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,130
怎么去爱你杀的人
You can't love the people you kill.

798
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,740
当然可以
You sure as hell can.

799
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,780
想杀你的人  你也要去爱
And you have to love the people who are trying to kill you.

800
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,040
耶稣也爱罗马人
Jesus loved the Romans.

801
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,040
他说  "天父  原谅他们吧
"Father, forgive them," He said,

802
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,650
他们并不清楚自己的所作所为"
"For they know not what they do."

803
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,530
他为什么不反抗
Why didn't he fight?

804
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,880
他为什么自愿牺牲
Why did he allow himself to be sacrificed?

805
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,520
我自问过许多遍
I ask myself that question a lot.

806
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,140
我理解《旧约》的上帝
I understand the Old Testament God,

807
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,600
权力至高无上
whose power is absolute,

808
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,970
用恐惧统治人类  但是他...
who rules through fear, but... him.

809
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,620
人类无法拥有至高无上的权力
There's no such thing as absolute power for us,

810
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,690
只能接受上帝的统治
except on the receiving end.

811
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,550
用恐惧统治不会有好下场
Using fear will get you nowhere.

812
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,250
你的工作不是裁决正义
It's not your job to determine what's just.

813
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,260
你也无权决定喜欢哪个上帝
It's not your place to choose the version of God you like best.

814
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,220
你不必一个人效忠国家
It's not your duty to serve this country alone,

815
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,220
也最好不要只想着为自己牟利
and it better not be your goal to simply serve yourself.

816
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,260
你效忠主
You serve the Lord.

817
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,870
通过他效忠众生
And through Him, you serve others.

818
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,400
两条规则
Two rules.

819
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,420
爱上帝  互敬互爱
Love God. Love each other.

820
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,120
就这样
Period.

821
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,390
你不是救世主  总统先生
You weren't chosen, Mr. President.

822
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,920
他才是
Only he was.

823
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,750
我能单独待一会儿吗
May I have a few moments?

824
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,000
一个人待着  祈祷
For myself. To pray.

825
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,880
可以啊
It's all yours.

826
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,340
爱
Love?

827
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,960
你就想推销这个吗
That's what you're selling?

828
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,960
我不要
Well, I don't buy it.

829
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,050
没事吧  先生
Is everything all right, sir?

830
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,480
我在祈祷  他突然倒了
I was praying and it just fell.

831
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,360
找个人清理一下
Please have someone clean this up.

832
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,260
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

833
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,970
这下我有上帝的耳朵了[上帝肯听我的了]
Well, I've got God's ear now.

835
00:44:51,530 --> 00:45:16,530
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}奥巴马2008年大选期间对小布什的反恐政策有很多批评
但当选总统后  他在国家安全和反恐政策上
并没有完全放弃小布什政府在反恐事务中的鹰派主张
虽然奥巴马下令美军和情报机构
不许再对被俘的恐怖嫌犯进行"水刑"等逼供措施
但同时也下令扩大在中东地区进行无人机"定点打击"的军事行为
在过去几年中  无人机轰炸
成为奥巴马清除中东恐怖嫌犯的主要手段
这个政策在美国国内招致来自民主党左派
和共和党自由意志派人士的广泛反对
一些民间人权组织不断出版报告称美军行为造成大量无辜民众伤亡

837
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:41,530
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2013年3月  美国司法部长霍德发表声明称
在未经适当司法程序前提下  在美国境内使用无人机
对美国籍恐怖嫌犯进行打击是违宪的
但是霍德没有说在境外进行无人机打击是违宪行为
司法部长霍德的声明发表后  来自肯塔基州的共和党参议员
著名的自由意志派政客兰德·保罗
在国会进行了长达13个小时的马拉松式演讲
其主题就是抗议美军出动无人机定点消灭美国籍的恐怖分子
他认为无论在国内还是国外
未经司法程序针对美国公民的无人机打击都是违宪的
