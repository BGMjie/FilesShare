《斯塔福德法案》第一条
"Title One of the Stafford Act:

38
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,460
"紧急情况"是指由总统指定的
'Emergency' means any occasion or instance for which,

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,570
场合或情形...
in the determination of the president..."

40
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,060
指定权在总统
"Determined" by the president.

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,270
-有先例吗  -只要我们能说明这些措施
- Any instance? - As long as we can make the argument

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,740
能拯救生命  保护人民安康就行
that this saves lives and protects health and safety.

43
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,580
失业导致犯罪
Well, unemployment leads to crime,

44
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,410
营养不良  以及恶劣的医疗服务
to malnutrition, to improper medical care.

45
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,090
这种说法肯定会在法庭上遭到攻击的
There's no doubt it'll be challenged in the courts.

46
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,860
就算最终闹上了法庭
Well, even so, by the time that happens,

47
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,430
那时人们也会见识到《美国就业法案》了
people will see what America Works looks like.

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,030
告诉我  从法律的角度说
Tell me, in your legal opinion...

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,660
你们觉得有足够的回旋余地吗
is there enough leeway here?

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,820
有的  法案用词足够模糊
Yes, the language is sufficiently vague.

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,870
不过得说清楚  这么做实在是前所未有
But just to be clear, this is completely unorthodox.

52
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,630
从没有哪个总统试过这么筹集资金
No president has ever tried to reappropriate funds this way.

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,850
谢谢各位  有这话就够了
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all I need.

54
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,580
各州不会支持的  太激进了
The states won't go for this. Too radical.

55
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,260
哪怕有一个我联系的州长
And if I call just one governor

56
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,770
拒绝了我然后向媒体泄露了风声
who says no and leaks it to the press,

57
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,540
还没等我正式提出  就会被国会穷追猛打
Congress will be on my ass before I get this out of the gates.

58
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,800
但是  哥伦比亚特区
But, the District of Columbia...

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,250
-没有州长  -只有你  一个市长
- No governor. - Just you, the mayor.

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,690
巴尼  我知道这会让你冒很大风险
Now, Barney, I know this puts you out on a ledge.

61
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,010
我喜欢  每个条款我都支持
I love it. I love everything about it.

62
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,040
我们年年都要为预算的每一分钱跟国会争
We have to fight Congress for every dollar in our budget, each year.

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,790
如果选民看到我从他们嘴里抠出钱来
If my people see me take the money they won't give us...

64
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,180
我就能赢得连任
well, I just won reelection.

65
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,020
这就是让巴尼·豪尔这样的强人当选的原因
This is why you put a brawler like Barney Hull in office,

66
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,160
不只是还他人情
aside from paying a debt.

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,620
把全美50位州长和535位国会议员加起来
Add up 50 governors and 535 members of Congress,

68
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,010
也赶不上一位有进取心的大胆市长
you don't come close to the gumption of one bold mayor.

69
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,270
我希望全城各处的人都去注册找工作
I want people registering for jobs in every part of the city

70
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,930
越快越好  趁法院还没发难
as soon as possible, before the court challenges bubble up.

71
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,000
在国会门口支个大帐篷怎么样
What about one big tent right in front of the Capitol?

72
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,590
让国会看看民众
Make Congress see the people

73
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,970
排队找工作排到林肯纪念堂的场面
line up all the way back to the Lincoln Memorial.

74
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,930
能在国庆日出手吗
Can we do something by July Fourth?

75
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,170
你只管放烟花  我找人来捧场
You bring the fireworks, I'll bring the people.

76
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,900
早上好  请坐
Good morning. Please, sit.

77
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,220
我知道雷米已经向各位介绍过情况了
I know Remy has just briefed you all,

78
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,490
那么除了国土安全部部长
so, aside from the Secretary of Homeland Security,

79
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,060
已经离职之外  还有谁持反对意见吗
who is no longer with us, does anyone else object to this plan?

80
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,730
很好  在新国安部长上任之前
Good. Until a new secretary is confirmed,

81
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,560
联邦应急管理署将直接对我负责  谢谢各位
FEMA will report directly to me. Thank you all very much.

82
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
失业不能
Unemployment doesn't

83
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,310
算作是自然灾害  总统先生
constitute a natural disaster, Mr. President.

84
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,480
《斯塔福德法案》授权我
The Stafford Act gives me full authority

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,260
定义紧急状况
to define an emergency.

86
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,830
但是  先生  我们的赈灾基金
But, sir, we've only got about three billion left

87
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,210
只剩下30亿不到了
in the Disaster Relief Fund,

88
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,920
而飓风季眼看就要来了
and we're about to go into hurricane season.

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,640
我们先用这现成的30亿
So we use the three billion that's there,

90
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,740
万一飓风来袭了
and if a hurricane hits,

91
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,510
国会定会拨款补充赈灾基金  他们一向如此
Congress replenishes the funds, just as they always do.

92
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,960
灾害发生后  每分每秒都极其珍贵  先生
When it comes to a disaster, every hour counts, sir.

93
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,680
如果还得等国会那边
If we're waiting around for Congress--

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,610
希尔瓦先生  这事就这么定了
Mr. Silva, this is moving forward.

95
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,160
平民会死伤惨重的  总统先生
People could die, Mr. President.

96
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
平民要是没工作  也会活不成的
People are dying because they don't have jobs.

97
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,170
虽然比死于地震洪水慢  但一样是死
Slower than a flood or an earthquake, but dying just the same.

98
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,270
您怎么能拿失业和4级飓风相提并论
You can't compare unemployment to a cat four hurricane.

99
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,490
我来你办公室找你
I came to your office

100
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,170
是希望你能继续坐在这个位子上
because I want this to remain your office.

101
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,800
连续三任总统都让你留任不是平白无故
There's a reason three presidents have kept you here.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,970
你专心致志  坚持不懈
You're dedicated, you're relentless,

103
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,530
而且工作能力极为优秀
you're exceptionally competent.

104
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,370
如果我们需要精打细算
If we have to stretch dollars even further,

105
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,810
找你准没错
you're the man to do it.

106
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,920
如果你走人了  就得找个没经验的了
It's either you or someone far less experienced.

107
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,120
两位周末就要去爱荷华了
The two of you head to Iowa at the end of the week.

108
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,820
是的  这一趟要去18个郡拉票
That's right. Eighteen counties this trip.

109
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,240
希望一月之前能走遍全州99个郡
By January, I plan on hitting all 99.

110
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,410
约翰会和我一起出席活动  直到他丈夫获释
John will join me at every event until his husband is released.

111
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,940
自从迈克尔被捕后你和他联系过吗
Have you had any contact with Michael since his arrest?

112
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,150
俄罗斯政府拒绝了
The Russian government has refused.

113
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,740
他们甚至不让他见律师
They won't let him speak to a lawyer.

114
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,830
所以约翰和我站在一起意义重大
That's why it's important John join me.

115
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,720
我们必须对莫斯科持续施压
We need to keep the pressure up on Moscow.

116
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,220
在全国许多地方  同性恋权益
You know, gay rights is controversial

117
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,460
都是极具争议性的话题
in many parts of the country.

118
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,770
您不担心和科里根的丈夫站在一起
Do you think that appearing with Corrigan's husband

119
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,940
会对您的选情不利吗
could possibly hurt you?

120
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,310
我认为美国人民想要一位不逃避问题的候选人
I think the American people want a candidate who doesn't dodge,

121
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,270
会诚实表达自己的立场
who is truthful about where she stands.

122
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,790
而不是回避争议
Not someone who shies away from controversy.

123
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,780
回避争论是一回事
It's one thing to shy away from controversy.

124
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,490
引发争论是另一回事
It's another thing to court it.

125
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,070
迈克尔因为直抒己见被捕
Well, Michael was arrested for speaking his mind.

126
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,870
如果捍卫言论自由有争议  那么...
If defending free speech is controversial, then...

127
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,810
我们不比俄罗斯好多少
we're no better than Russia.

128
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,490
真希望我们的政府里
I wish that there were

129
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,950
有更多人去捍卫言论自由
more people in our government defending it.

130
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,970
你指的是安德伍德政府吗
Are you talking specifically about the Underwood Administration?

131
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,120
我认为总统可以采取更多措施
I think the president could do more.

132
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,810
白宫表示他们已经直接与
You know, the White House has said hat they've been speaking

133
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,570
克里姆林宫方面沟通  他们原话是
directly with the Kremlin, that they, and I quote here:

134
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,190
"必须解决这一问题  因为这关系到
"Have to tackle this issue as it relates to the larger

135
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,300
两国之间更重要的外交关系"
diplomatic relationship between the two nations."

136
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,520
那我们为什么还没看到这些对话的证据呢
Then why haven't we seen any evidence of those talks?

137
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,790
我当选总统后  美国人民可以放心
When I'm president, the American people can rest assured

138
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,480
我会认真履行
that I will take my oath

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,080
捍卫和保护我们人民的誓言
to defend and protect our citizens seriously.

140
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,470
-你觉得她怎么样  -什么  邓巴吗
- What do you think of her? - What, Dunbar?

141
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,020
对
Yeah.

142
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,960
我认为这届政府做得还不够好
I believe that the administration could do better...

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,680
-你为安德伍德工作过  -现在不了
- You worked for Underwood. - Not anymore.

144
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,370
我不会生气的
I won't be offended.

145
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,840
我很喜欢她说的这些
Uh, I like a lot about what she has to say.

146
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,610
你会投票给她吗
Would you vote for her?

147
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,670
不知道  可能吧
I don't know. I might.

148
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,590
是啊  很可能会
Yeah. Probably would.

149
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,400
-多快  -明天
- How soon? - Tomorrow.

150
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,880
我们会在这事上遭强烈抨击
We're gonna get hit hard on this.

151
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,450
总好过因为科里根的事被抨击
Better than getting hit on Corrigan.

152
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,840
你看《维埃拉秀》了吗
You saw Vieira?

153
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,090
邓巴很聪明
Dunbar's smart.

154
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,130
我们还没参选她就开始打压我们
She's running against us before we're even running.

155
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,750
她也会在联邦应急管理署这事上攻击我们
She'll attack us on the FEMA thing, too.

156
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,430
那就让她攻击  至少是我们控制舆论
Then let her. At least we're controlling the narrative.

157
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,810
我们第一次谈时  你说初秋
When we first spoke, you mentioned early fall.

158
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,200
听着  邓巴势头强盛是因为没人挑战她
Look, Dunbar's got momentum because no one's challenging her.

159
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,690
但我们一宣布联邦应急管理署的计划
But once we drop the FEMA plan,

160
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,190
就会盖过她的报道
that'll take her off message.

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,170
然后你宣布参选就会分散她的注意  连环出击
And your candidacy will distract her. It's a one-two punch.

162
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,740
我们会开始抢走女性选民的选票
We'll start bleeding away the woman's vote.

163
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,140
我不确定现在几乎毫无准备
I'm just not sure how smart it is to rush into a campaign

164
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,970
-就宣布参选是否有利  -又不是真的参选
- with so little preparation. - This isn't a real campaign.

165
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,840
但要看起来像真格的
But it needs to look like one.

166
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,200
我以为你想跟我一队呢
I thought you wanted to be on my ticket.

167
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,320
我要赌上声誉
It's my reputation at stake.

168
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,490
-我不想看起来有勇无谋  -听着  没人...
- I don't want to look foolhardy. - Look, no one--

169
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,920
市长明早将会宣布
Mayor's announcing in the morning.

170
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,680
赛斯在跟他办公室合作
Seth's working with his office.

171
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,990
你看  杰姬  现在是最佳时机
You see, Jackie, this is perfect timing.

172
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,470
联邦应急管理署计划开始实施
The FEMA plan goes into action,

173
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,840
你几周后宣布参选  说你必须参选
you announce in a couple of weeks, you say you had to run.

174
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,180
安德伍德总统在联邦应急管理署恣意妄为
President Underwood is being reckless with FEMA.

175
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,230
你出面反对我
You come out against me

176
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,010
和《美国就业法案》  然后抢了邓巴的风头
and America Works and you steal Dunbar's thunder.

177
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,400
之后等到我退出
And then I flip-flop

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,280
与你一同参选  不是态度大转弯吗
when I pull out and you put me on the ticket?

179
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,330
到那时候  五万人将拥有工作
By then, 50,000 people will have jobs,

180
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,800
那就不像是态度大转弯了
and it won't look like a flip-flop.

181
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,180
而是你豁然开朗
It'll look like you saw the light.

182
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,040
听着  你跟雷米一起出去
Now, look, why don't you go off with Remy

183
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,270
讨论一下细节
and you discuss the details,

184
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,100
多考虑考虑再做决定
and just give it some thought before you decide.

185
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,170
-谢谢  总统先生  -来我办公室谈吧
- Thank you, Mr. President. - Let's talk in my office.

186
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,590
我最大的担心是资金
My biggest concern is funding.

187
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,420
我总不能坐普通舱去爱荷华
I couldn't fly coach to Iowa.

188
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,940
我给你找一笔政治行动委员会资金来铺路
I'll get you some PAC money rolling your way.

189
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,700
应该足以让你启动宣传了
Should be enough to get you started.

190
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,080
如果我参选  就不能虎头蛇尾
If I run, it shouldn't be half-ass.

191
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,220
所以我们得好好谈谈这个
Which is why we should talk about this.

192
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,130
你想要有完整家庭的候选人
You want a candidate with a family.

193
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,570
我们要抢的就是女性选民的选票
We are after the woman's vote.

194
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,560
艾伦和我已经讨论过了
Alan and I have already talked about it.

195
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,020
是吗
You have?

196
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,560
对  我们第一次约会时就开过结婚的玩笑
Yeah. We joked about getting married on our first date.

197
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,350
我不用生产就能有两个孩子
I get two kids without the stretch marks.

198
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,290
当我提到可能参选时  这就不再是玩笑话了
And when I mentioned I might run, it stopped becoming a joke.

199
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,530
艾伦能接受吗
Is Alan open to it?

200
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,140
-本就是他的主意  -那你呢
- It was his idea. - And what about you?

201
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,750
我们深爱彼此
We do love each other.

202
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,700
他看上去是个好人
He seems like a good guy.

203
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,970
是的  他的孩子也很棒
He is. And his children are wonderful.

204
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,820
你也应该考虑结婚
You should think about getting hitched.

205
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,700
我们要谈谈时间表吗
Should we talk timeline?

206
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,880
-结婚的吗  -竞选
- For marriage? - The campaign.

207
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,870
这可不是提议  这是会谈
This is far from an offer. This is a conversation.

208
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,200
而且是个从没发生过的会谈
And it's a conversation that never happened.

209
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,380
我从后门进来  待会儿还从后门离开
I took the back door in, I'll take the back door out.

210
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,060
本季度工资单上没有你
We keep you off the payroll this quarter.

211
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,180
你9月30日正式开始任职
You start officially September 30th.

212
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,950
下个季度的选举委员会文件才会有我  可以
Next quarter's FEC filings. It's fine.

213
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,020
关于工资你有什么想法
What are you thinking in terms of salary?

214
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,980
每季度2.2万
Twenty-two thousand per quarter.

215
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,720
就算我这样  也不只值这个价
That's way below what I'm worth. Even in this state.

216
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,400
你觉得多少合适
What do you think's appropriate?

217
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,560
25万加上3%的广告投入
Two-fifty and three points on the ad-buy.

218
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,340
-我们负担不起  -不  你们担得起
- That's beyond our means. - No, it's not.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,370
这只是你财产的九牛一毛
It's a drop in the bucket from your estate.

220
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,060
你说你想参加是因为你对这次竞选有信心
You said you wanted in because you believed in this campaign.

221
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,120
-没错  -现在看来你是为了钱
- That's right. - Sounds like it's more about money.

222
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,000
我希望被重视  25万和少量广告投入并不多
It's about being valued. Two-fifty and the points is a bargain.

223
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,370
我想为你工作  而不是向你乞讨
I want to work for you, just not as a beggar.

224
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,230
我们还不信任你  道格
We don't trust you yet, Doug.

225
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,080
可以说根本不信任你  所以你就是在乞讨
We don't even halfway trust you, so you are a beggar.

226
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,990
我还没证明自己  你也不应该信任我
And you shouldn't trust me... until I prove myself.

227
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,630
你不拿出筹码
That's a gamble you don't get to take

228
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,370
就不能冒这个险
without putting chips on the table.

229
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,140
我和会辛西娅谈的
Cynthia and I will discuss.

230
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,770
感谢你抽空
Thank you for your time.

231
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,070
我先看下外面
Let me check first.

232
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,190
好了  安全
Okay, it's clear.

233
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,150
-你怎么看  -为什么要冒险
- What do you think? - Why take the gamble?

234
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,070
我不想一开始决策
I don't want us to start making decisions

235
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,410
就处于劣势  只会吃亏
from a position of weakness. That is how you lose.

236
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,940
我觉得这是引狼入室
I think we're inviting the fox into the hen house.

237
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,220
要是间谍会
Anyone who wants to be a mole

238
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,880
毫不犹豫地接受条件
accepts the first offer without question.

239
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,380
他却讨价还价
He's negotiating.

240
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,390
所以你相信他了
So you actually believe him?

241
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,140
半信半疑
Not necessarily.

242
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,630
但这不代表他没有价值
But that doesn't mean that he doesn't have value.

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,930
这些我们不需要了
Yeah, we're not gonna need any of these.

244
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,350
全都放在这里
We're gonna keep these right here.

245
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,580
凯特·鲍德温  久仰久仰
Kate Baldwin, the one and only.

246
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,280
我就说听到这里有人
I thought I heard somebody in here.

247
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,240
欢迎来白宫  或者应该说欢迎回白宫
Welcome to the White House. Or welcome back, I should say.

248
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,940
这里比我记忆中小
It feels smaller than I remember.

249
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,290
-他们安排你坐哪里  -这里  第二排
- Where do they have you sitting? - Right there, second row.

250
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,510
我以为你会想要第一排
I would've thought you wanted first row.

251
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,340
我听说你说话会飞吐沫
I heard you spit when you talk.

252
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,850
明天总统会讲什么
What's the president speaking about tomorrow?

253
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,840
-你真是不浪费一分一秒  -没错
- You don't waste a minute, do you? - No.

254
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,270
实不相瞒  我很惊讶
I gotta say, I was surprised

255
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,320
《电讯报》会派你来采访白宫
that the Telegraph sent you to cover the White House.

256
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,000
谁会离开伦敦分社啊
I mean, who leaves the London bureau?

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,860
艾拉是我的爱徒
Ayla was a protégée of mine.

258
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,680
明白了  他们把老师父都请来了
I see, so now they bring in the big guns.

259
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,580
就一位师父  资历也够老
Just one gun, but big enough.

260
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,390
-别打我的主意  -什么主意
- Don't get any ideas. - About what?

261
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,460
这个记者证我不会摘的
This is gonna stay around my neck.

262
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,700
你不能连续解雇两个《电讯报》的记者
You can't boot two reporters in a row from the Telegraph.

263
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,910
-更不能是两个女记者  -我没这个意思
- Certainly not two women. - I have no desire to do that.

264
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,030
跟你合作  我很荣幸
It's an honor to work with you.

265
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,530
普利策奖  皮博迪奖
Pulitzer, Peabody.

266
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,180
再拿个诺贝尔奖  就是三料冠军了
Get yourself a Nobel, you'll have a trifecta.

267
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,760
你可真会说话
Oh, you're almost charming.

268
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,620
凯特  我不是你的敌人
Kate, I'm not your enemy here.

269
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,530
艾拉没做错  你却惩罚她
You punished Ayla for doing good work.

270
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,550
她发力  你反击  很公平
She hit hard and you hit back. Fair enough.

271
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,930
我会加倍发力
Well, I'm gonna hit twice as hard as she ever did

272
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,200
因为我可以  也应该这么做
because I can and because someone should.

273
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,740
放马过来吧
I look forward to it.

274
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,110
你真不会说谎  我们明早见
You're such a terrible liar. I'll see you bright and early.

275
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,030
有时间吗
You got a minute?

276
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,040
有
Sure.

277
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,330
这是明天声明的草稿
Here's the draft for the statement tomorrow.

278
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,320
想让你斧正一下
I want it to be perfect.

279
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,510
国会肯定会火力全开  回击我们
Congress will fire back, all guns blazing,

280
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,350
邓巴也肯定会大作文章
and I'm sure Dunbar will make a meal and a half out of it.

281
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,650
但我觉得准备进攻的感觉很好
But I gotta say, I feel good. To be on the offensive.

282
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,580
如果不能私下东拼西凑出这些钱来
If I can't scrape the money together behind the scenes,

283
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,360
我就光天化日之下抢银行
I'll rob the bank in broad goddamn daylight.

284
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,210
我们要强行逼迫他们通过《美国就业法案》
We'll cram America Works down their throats and watch them choke.

285
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,980
不再谨小慎微
Enough tiptoeing.

286
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,480
给
Here.

287
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,370
这些改动很棒
Oh, these changes are good.

288
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,110
看你这么兴奋  我也很高兴
It makes me happy to see you excited.

289
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,090
我又能松口气了
I feel free again.

290
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,440
-真希望我也能  -还在忙决议案吗
- I wish I felt the same. - The resolution?

291
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,690
还有些最后的安抚工作  但...
Just some last minute hand-holding, but...

292
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,300
我相信我们会成功的
I think we'll get there.

293
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,050
我完全相信你
I have complete confidence in you.

294
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,660
-你喜欢这个房间吗  -还不错
- Do you like this room? - It's fine.

295
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,720
我还没在这儿过过夜呢
You know, I haven't spent the night here yet.

296
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,720
-也许我可以...  -我明早七点飞机
- Maybe I could-- - My plane leaves at seven.

297
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,720
我得睡一会儿
I should probably get some sleep.

298
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,240
明天记得看新闻  会很有意思的
You watch the news tomorrow. Should be fun.

299
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,060
-我会的  -晚安
- I will. - Good night.

300
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,350
17年  我在警局工作17年

304
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,170
每天只能吃到从学校领到的那一顿饭
whose only meal each day was the one they get at school.

305
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,510
知道这些事的根源是什么吗
You know what's at the root of all that?

306
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,820
因为人们没有工作
Folks don't have jobs!

307
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,460
华盛顿有六万失业人口
There are 60,000 unemployed people in Washington.

308
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,120
这是场灾难
It's a disaster.

309
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,260
更丢脸的是  这是国家的首都
And it's a disgrace here in the nation's capital.

310
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,980
所以今早  在总统的敦促下
So this morning, at the president's urging,

311
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,150
我宣布哥伦比亚特区进入紧急状态

312
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,460
并正式申请从联邦应急管理署赈灾基金
And I am formally requesting three billion dollars

313
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,090
拨款30亿  用以安排人们重回岗位
from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to put people back to work.

314
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,160
混帐东西
Motherfucker.

315
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
任何人  真的是任何人
Anyone, and I mean anyone,

316
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,310
只要在哥伦比亚特区注册求职
who registers for work in the District of Columbia

317
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,330
就保证可以得到工作
will be guaranteed a job.

318
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,100
我在跟内阁努力增加
I'm working with my cabinet to increase

319
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,890
基础设施建设  保养和修理方面的岗位

会增加探员招募和文职人员招聘

323
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,720
将得到每个岗位每年最高
will get up to $45,000 toward the yearly salary

324
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,640
4.5万美元的薪水补贴

325
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,160
我们的目标是12个月内全员就业

我们希望华盛顿的成功

327
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,080
能说服国会在全国供资支持《美国就业法案》

328
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,660
现在  我会回答几个问题
Now, I'll take a few questions.

329
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,680
总统先生
Mr. President!

330
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,080
大使女士  借一步说话
Madam Ambassador. A word, please.

331
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,530
失陪
Excuse me.

332
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,870
我们要收回对维和决议案的支持
We are withdrawing support of the peacekeeping resolution.

333
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,650
-为什么  -因为以色列要收回
- Why? - Because Israel is.

334
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,350
巴勒斯坦愿意接受计划  但不达成共识...
Palestine is open to the plan, but without consensus...

335
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,070
这是直接来自耶路撒冷的意思吗
This came directly from Jerusalem?

336
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,780
-是的  外交部长  -伊莉安娜说什么了吗
- Yes, the foreign minister. - Nothing came from Eliana?

337
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,600
没有  但我是来找她谈的
No, but I came to speak to her.

338
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,000
我会亲自跟她谈  谢谢你  哈桑
I'll speak to her myself. Thank you, Hasan.

339
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,290
谢谢你  大使
Thank you, Ambassador.

340
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,760
莫斯科威胁说要卖武器给伊朗
Moscow is threatening to sell arms to Iran.

341
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,710
他们时常这么威胁
They always make that threat.

342
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,640
耶路撒冷方面认为这个决议案
The feeling in Jerusalem is that this resolution

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,790
也许会逼他们铤而走险  不值得冒险
may push them over the edge. It's not worth the risk.

344
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,440
你为什么不来找我  还有两小时就要投票了
Why didn't you come to me? The vote's in two hours.

345
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,260
我30分钟前刚接到电话
I got the call 30 minutes ago.

346
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,960
俄罗斯不想丢面子
Russia doesn't want to be humiliated

347
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,230
因为我们绕过了他们
because we did this without them.

348
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,220
你知道他们就是虚张声势
You know it's a bluff on their part.

349
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,650
总理认为这次投票只是象征性的
The prime minister feels that this vote is just symbolic.

350
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,990
美国不会真的出动军队
That the US won't actually contribute troops.

351
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,210
不  一旦通过  我们绝对会坚持到底
No, we will absolutely follow through once it's passed.

352
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,300
总理有疑虑
The prime minister has his doubts.

353
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,420
抱歉  这不是我能控制的
I'm sorry, it's out of my hands.

354
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,010
克莱尔
Claire?

355
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,820
各位大使  我需要你们撤回决议案
Ambassadors, I need you to withdraw the resolution.

356
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,160
我们不能达成共识
We lost consensus.

357
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,700
我需要推迟投票  直到我们重新达成共识
I need to postpone the vote until we get it back.

358
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,480
特拉弗斯部长是个很好的例子
Secretary Travers is a good example.

359
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,340
国土安全部
Homeland Security?

360
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,700
-应该说是前部长  -他下台了吗
- Former secretary, I should say. - He's done?

361
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,260
还没宣布  但史蒂夫打电话给我了
They haven't announced, but Steve called me.

362
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,790
说他在联邦应急管理署的事上反对总统
Said he stood up to the president on this FEMA nonsense.

363
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,700
国土安全部对联邦应急管理署有管辖权
Homeland Security has jurisdiction over FEMA now.

364
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,500
没错
Right.

365
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,520
总统当场要求他提交辞呈
The president demanded his letter of resignation right then and there.

366
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,280
-这些都是非正式对话  -明白
- This is all off the record. - Yeah.

367
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,690
-保罗真是个大嘴巴  -所以是真的吗
- Paul's got a big mouth. - So it's true?

368
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,270
-这是非正式对话吗  -绝对是
- This is off the record? - Completely.

369
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,980
我用加密电话给你打
Let me call you on my encrypted phone.

370
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,190
我的号码有屏蔽  所以...
My number is blocked, so--

371
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,660
这里是国土安全部  我有你电话
This is Homeland Security. I have your number.

372
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,960
有电话呼入  按接听键...
Incoming call. Press the pickup bu--

373
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,740
-部长先生  -是真的  我辞职了
- Mr. Secretary. - It's true. I resigned.

374
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,090
那你为什么还在办公室
Why are you still in the office?

375
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,660
点卯撞钟等白宫公布
Punching the clock until the White House wants to go public.

376
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,970
如果你反对那项政策
Why wouldn't you go public yourself,

377
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,630
为什么不自己公布消息
if you're so against the policy?

378
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,480
我是为总统服务的
I serve at the pleasure of the president.

379
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,100
兰德里已经提供了信息
I have Landry on background.

380
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
我要写关于辞职的报道
I'm writing about the resignation.

381
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,420
我无法阻止你  但你不能引用我的话
And I can't stop you. But there won't be a quote from me.

382
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,930
别让政府逃脱责任
Don't let the administration off the hook.

383
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,510
这是发表反对意见的机会
This an opportunity to speak out.

384
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,130
能做到我这一步
You don't have the career I've had

385
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,690
不是靠公开批评上司
by criticizing your bosses publicly,

386
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,530
不管你觉得自己多厉害
no matter how strongly you feel.

387
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,310
和联邦应急管理署的署长阿尼·希尔瓦谈谈
Talk to Arnie Silva, the FEMA Administrator.

388
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,780
他比我更反感这一切
He's more disgusted by all this than I am.

389
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,270
事关人命  他却不管不顾
People's lives are in the balance. And he doesn't care.

390
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,230
这是我们接下来12个月的预测
Our projections for the next 12 months.

391
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,900
我们正处于拉尼娜时期
We're in a La Niña phase,

392
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,700
也就是说太平洋温度下降
which means falling temperatures in the Pacific.

393
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,940
我们预计这一季至少要发生两次大型山体滑坡
We expect at least two major landfalls this season.

394
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,990
家园被毁  损失数十亿
Homes destroyed, billions in damage,

395
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,160
成千上万人断电
tens of thousands without power.

396
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,060
这还仅仅是飓风的危害  要是碰上大地震
And that's just hurricanes. If we get a major earthquake,

397
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,810
或者洪水  再或森林火灾
or flood, or forest fire...

398
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,320
都在这里面了
It's all in there.

399
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,210
他曾要求你辞职吗
Has he asked you to resign?

400
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,360
他威胁过我
He threatened it.

401
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,320
但是我说我会配合
But I said I'd cooperate.

402
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,950
为什么
Why?

403
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,290
没人比我更有经验
Nobody has more experience.

404
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,740
如果离开  我无法原谅自己
I couldn't forgive myself if I left.

405
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,830
但是你刚才不是说  如果赈灾基金耗尽
But you just said, if the Relief Fund is depleted, then--

406
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,240
那人们会受难
People will suffer.

407
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,160
但在我的照管下  受难的人能少些
But on my watch, fewer will suffer.

408
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,720
我需要引用你的话  希尔瓦先生
I need a quote, Mr. Silva.

409
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,900
我做不到
I can't do that.

410
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,650
人命关天  你有责任
People could die, you have a responsibility.

411
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,990
总统创建了一种噤声与恐惧交织的氛围
The president has built a culture of silence and fear.

412
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,890
你可以结束它
That can end with you.

413
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,320
这个文件夹比任何话语都更有说服力
That folder will speak louder than anything I could say.

414
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,130
同一天头版两篇报道都出自鲍德温女士吗
Two front page bylines on the same day for Ms. Baldwin?

415
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,690
真是踢走只斗狗  放进条火龙来
You kicked out a pit bull and you let in a dragon.

416
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,950
我没想到《电讯报》能再派一个她这样的
I didn't think the Telegraph would send someone like her.

417
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,950
也许你是根本没考虑
Well, maybe you just didn't think.

418
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,030
您让我管束他们  先生
You wanted me to implement discipline, sir.

419
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,880
传递讯息  我做了
To send a message. And so I did.

420
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,870
他们的回应更强烈  是不是
Well, they've sent back an even stronger message, haven't they?

421
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,590
我对此负责  先生
I take responsibility for that, sir,

422
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,570
我会不遗余力让她听话的
and I will do my best to keep her in line.

423
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,170
不遗余力
Your best?

424
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,120
有他们总编辑保着  谁也碰不了她
It's their top bureau chief. She's untouchable.

425
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,050
我不想假装我能百分之百控制她
I don't want to pretend that I can control her 100 percent.

426
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,260
-特拉弗斯  -他否认曾与她谈话
- Travers? - Denied speaking with her,

427
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,570
但是肯定是他
but it must be him.

428
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,540
我想内阁中再没别人会了
I don't think anybody else in the cabinet would.

429
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,980
我们确认他辞职一事
Let's confirm his resignation.

430
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,900
现在还保密没意义了
No point in keeping it a secret now.

431
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,730
告诉史蒂夫他可以把办公室清空了
Tell Steve he can vacate his office.

432
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,020
那希尔瓦呢
And what about Silva?

433
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,990
关于防灾预测的细节相当专业
The details on the disaster projections are very inside baseball.

434
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,600
我们不能炒了他  如果飓风来了
We can't fire him! If there's a hurricane,

435
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,630
他是唯一能防止灾难变成浩劫的人
he's the only guy that can keep a disaster from becoming a catastrophe.

436
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,460
-邓巴说什么  -还没有公开表示
- And what's Dunbar saying? - Nothing yet, publicly.

437
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,150
她可能想让好戏演到终场
She's probably letting this play out.

438
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,350
让我自掘坟墓
Letting me dig my own grave.

439
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,360
我们必须推销《美国就业法案》
We have to sell America Works.

440
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,190
等人们有工作  就不需要别的吹捧了
It should sell itself once we get people employed.

441
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,700
是要这效果  但我们不能止步于此
Well, that's the idea, but we don't stop there.

442
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,250
-广告和公告牌  -用谁的钱
- Commercials and billboards? - On whose money?

443
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,120
即使这样  广告也不够
And even so, we need more than ad-buys.

444
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
我们需要...挖掘它背后的深意
We need... We need the philosophy behind it.

445
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,600
我们需要实质性的东西  我们需要...
We need something of substance. We need something...

446
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,140
我们需要能启发想象力的东西
We need something that will capture the imagination.

447
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,530
-你们玩《纪念碑谷》吗  -那是什么
- Either of you play Monument Valley? - What's that?

448
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,380
-是一款游戏  -我不玩游戏  先生
- It's a video game. - I don't play them, sir.

449
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,630
我在易趣上把Xbox卖了  玩着太上瘾
I sold my Xbox on eBay. It was too addictive.

450
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,380
不  不是主机游戏
No, it's not a console game.

451
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,690
你们读读这个
You both read this

452
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,140
然后告诉我你不想玩这个
and then tell me that you wouldn't want to play this.

453
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,710
我敢说全国只有九个顾问
I'd say there's nine consultants in the country

454
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,200
真正懂得外交政策
who truly know foreign policy.

455
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,080
我是第一
Me, I'm number one.

456
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,160
失去意识的我是第二
Me in a coma is number two.

457
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,320
但是还剩下七个逊于我的呢
But that still leaves seven who are cheaper.

458
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,680
我重视良言
I value good counsel,

459
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,310
我也有足够脑子知道自己的欠缺
and I'm smart enough to know what I don't know.

460
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,230
截至目前你对我们的评价如何
What would be your assessment of us so far?

461
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,250
迈克尔·科里根的事你处理得一团糟
You're making a big stink out of this Michael Corrigan thing,

462
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,800
但这还只是表面上的
but that's just surface.

463
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,270
你得明白科里根为何被捕
You have to understand why Corrigan got arrested.

464
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,480
佩特罗夫想迎合传统观念人群
Petrov's appealing to his traditional base.

465
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,880
不  这与约旦河谷有关
No. This is about the Jordan Valley.

466
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,310
我不太明白
I don't follow.

467
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,210
复仇
Retaliation.

468
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,220
这得回溯到几个月前的峰会上
It goes back to the summit a couple of months ago.

469
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,050
这里是约旦河谷
Look, this... is the Jordan Valley.

470
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,120
等一下  我放到大屏幕上去
All right, hold on, I'll make it easier.

471
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,410
这是河谷  在这里
That's the Valley. Right there.

472
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,590
1967年以来一直归以色列
Occupied by Israel since 1967,

473
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,640
一直是与巴勒斯坦达成和平协定的拦路虎
it's been a major roadblock in any peace accord with the Palestinians.

474
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,480
安德伍德派维和部队过去  以色列人走了
Underwood sends peacekeeping troops, the Israelis leave,

475
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,340
-巴勒斯坦人开心了  -没那么简单
- the Palestinians are happy. - It's not that simple.

476
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,060
所有人都为这个小地方牵肠挂肚
Everyone gets hung up on this little patch of land ten miles by 40,

477
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,380
但你得往远了看
but you have to look outwards,

478
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,820
越过约旦  叙利亚还有伊拉克
past Jordan and Syria, past Iraq.

479
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,710
这里  高加索山脉
Here... to the Caucasus.

480
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,540
这里是俄罗斯的地盘
That's Russia's sphere of influence.

481
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,120
他们不觉得维和部队是中东问题
They don't see the peacekeeping force as a Middle East issue.

482
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,280
而是觉得这是美国军队的战略调度
They see it as strategic deployment of US troops

483
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,220
离他们南部边界不到一千里
less than a thousand miles from their southern border.

484
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,240
你是说  科里根只是一枚棋子  一个筹码
So you're saying Corrigan's a pawn, a play for leverage?

485
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,880
更像是打响的第一枪
More of a first salvo.

486
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,860
莫斯科要表明对反抗决议案的决心
Moscow wants to show it's serious about fighting this resolution.

487
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,420
要我猜的话
Now, if I had to guess,

488
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,270
安德伍德在峰会时本想拉拢俄罗斯
Underwood tried to bring Russia into the mix during the summit.

489
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,440
成为合作伙伴
Get involved early on as partners.

490
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,210
但佩特罗夫不肯合作
And when Petrov didn't play ball,

491
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,830
安德伍德就转守为攻  是场豪赌
Underwood went on the offensive, which is a huge gamble.

492
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,620
-怎么说  -没人想让联合国军队过去
- Tell me how. - Nobody wants UN troops there.

493
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,300
以色列人不想  巴勒斯坦人不想
Not the Israelis, not the Palestinians,

494
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,310
阿拉伯人也不想
not the Arabs.

495
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,740
他们合作都是因为美国的施压
They're playing along because the US is pressuring them.

496
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,280
但只要有一点差错
But just one little thing needs to go wrong,

497
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,080
所有人都拿着火柴等着点你的炸药包
and you've got a tinderbox where everyone's holding matches.

498
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,550
那他为什么要采取这样的行动
So why is he following this course of action at all?

499
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,190
因为他很聪明
Because he's smart.

500
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,820
-可你刚说  -他是聪明过头
- You just said-- - He's being too smart.

501
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,610
要是这招行得通  他能拿诺贝尔奖
If it pays off, hey, he wins a Nobel Prize. But...

502
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,250
但行不通的话  他毫无反击之力
if it backfires, he leaves himself wide open.

503
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,310
到时你得火力全开抨击他
And that's when you need to hit him hard.

504
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,190
一项让世界更为危险的灾难性外交政策
A disastrous foreign policy that made the world more dangerous.

505
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,710
他还让他毫无外交经验的妻子
And he had his wife with zero foreign policy experience

506
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,020
-主掌大局  -我想让你加入  乔
- lead the goddamn charge. - I'd like to bring you aboard, Joe.

507
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,570
-你什么时候能开工  -我已经开工了
- When can you start? - I believe I already did.

508
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,430
我今天稍后会把文件给你拿来
I'll get the paperwork over to you later today.

509
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,310
我想问下  是谁推荐的我
Let me ask, who referred me?

510
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,340
-你声名在外  -是啊  声名在外的混蛋
- You have quite a reputation. - Yeah, for being an asshole.

511
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
肯定是你尊敬的人大力举荐了我
Somebody you respect must have recommended me highly.

512
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,400
安德伍德的前雇员
A former Underwood staffer.

513
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,940
我没跟他的人共事过
I never worked with any of his people.

514
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,520
这也是他举荐你的原因之一
Which is one of the reasons he recommended you.

515
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,650
有道理
Touché.

516
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
这是什么
What is this?

517
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,120
如果你们卖给伊朗一丁点武器
A list of the Russian officials who will be sanctioned

518
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,140
就将遭制裁的俄国官员名单
if you sell a single truckload of arms to Iran.

519
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,270
我都没进前十
I didn't even make the top ten.

520
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,200
制裁会进一步扩大
These sanctions can and will escalate.

521
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,410
然后呢
And then what?

522
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,500
我们联合起来  实现对他们的制裁
We'd build a coalition to impose their own sanctions.

523
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,600
然后呢
And then what?

524
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,630
亚历克西
Alexi,

525
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,730
你明白这会在俄罗斯造成怎样的金融危机
you know what an economic crisis that would be for Russia.

526
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,530
就如你们和中国打的贸易战一样吗
Like the trade war you waged with China?

527
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,010
只不过我们只有3%的出口额是给美国
Except in our case, only three percent of exports go to the US.

528
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,310
欧洲需要我们的天然气
And Europe needs our natural gas.

529
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,590
他们不会为几个给伊朗的短程导弹放弃这些
They won't forfeit that over a few short-range missiles to Iran.

530
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,040
你不会想在恐怖主义国家军备
You don't want to challenge us

531
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,060
这种问题上挑战我们
on the armament of a terrorist state.

532
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,310
我们永远不会出现这种问题
We'll never be presented with that problem.

533
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,310
你无法向以色列人保证出军
You can't assure the Israelis you'll provide troops.

534
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,510
国会两党都不支持总统
The President doesn't have the support of either party in Congress.

535
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,980
不出兵就没有以色列支持
No troops, no Israel.

536
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,520
没有以色列支持就没有共识
No Israel, no consensus.

537
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,490
没有共识  决议案就没戏
No consensus, no resolution.

538
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,560
我会让决议案通过的
I will get this resolution passed.

539
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,380
不要小瞧我的能力和决心
Don't underestimate my ability or desire to do so.

540
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,270
我放任你的热情够久了
I've indulged your enthusiasm long enough.

541
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,010
你有点好高鹜远啊  克莱尔
You've bit off more than you can chew, Claire.

542
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,460
交给专业人士来处理
Leave this to the professionals

543
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,510
你的决议案也能死得痛快点
and let your little resolution die a painless death.

544
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,370
事实就是  你不是当大使的料
The truth is, you have no business being ambassador

545
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,540
就跟我不是当第一夫人的料一样
any more than I do being First Lady.

546
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,870
裙子不错
That's a very nice dress, by the way.

547
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,780
"她用扫帚捅地板
"She stabbed the floor with a broom.

548
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,840
每周三卡拉OK之夜
Karaoke every Wednesday.

549
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,610
会有音痴的醉妞唱毁小甜甜的歌
Some tone-deaf drunk girl mutilating Britney Spears.

550
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,500
她知道楼下酒吧听不到楼上捅扫帚的声音
She knew they couldn't hear the broom in the bar below.

551
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,790
但我们都需要一种形式  而这是她的
But we all need a ritual, and this was hers.

552
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,710
捅三下  木头对木头
Three short thrusts, wood on wood,

553
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,250
完全没有作用的空洞之声
a hollow sound which accomplished nothing.

554
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,280
戴维马上就回家了
David would be home soon.

555
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,430
他会说  '太热了'  她打开了窗户
'It's too hot,' he'd say. She opened the window.

556
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,780
音乐非常大声  她无法忽略"
The music was so loud, she couldn't ignore it."

557
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,430
给你
Here.

558
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,150
你不买新的吗
Aren't you gonna buy the new one?

559
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,000
我会买电子书  但你能在这本上签字吗
I will, on my Kindle. But will you please sign this?

560
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,690
-写给谁  -莱斯莉  LESLEY
- Who should I make it out to? - Lesley. L-E-S-L-E-Y.

561
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,610
《天蝎》改变了我的生活
Scorpio totally changed my life.

562
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,430
那种力量  愤怒  是你的书里我最喜欢的
The energy and the anger... It's my favorite book of yours.

563
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,570
大概是我最喜欢的书了
Probably my favorite book, period.

564
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,390
-一定要读新的  -好的
- Make sure you read the new one. - Yes.

565
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,110
要写给谁呢
Who should I make it out to?

566
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,450
这是对《斯塔福法案》的曲解  你心里清楚
It's a perversion of the Stafford Act and you know it.

567
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,570
这对《斯塔福法案》的解读  我们的解读不同
It's a reading of the Stafford Act. We read it differently.

568
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,040
你不能占用
You can't just raid funds

569
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,430
国会调拨用于特定用途的资金
that Congress appropriated for a specific use,

570
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,080
-任意按你的想法使用  -显然我可以
- then use them however you want. - Clearly, I can.

571
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,620
这是在直接挑衅国会  总统先生
This is a direct challenge to Congress, Mr. President.

572
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,390
鲍勃和我已经同意
Bob and I have agreed.

573
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,360
两党都会在这个问题上反对你
Both parties will fight you on this.

574
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,260
那至少我促进了两党合作
Well, at least I'm cultivating bipartisanship.

575
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,150
先生们  我不想这样做
Gentlemen, I don't want to do this,

576
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,010
但你们给我留了什么选择余地吗
but what choice have you left me?

577
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,160
我们立法部门就是要审核你的行政部门
Our branch is here to check yours.

578
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,250
如果我们认为《美国就业法案》
If we didn't feel America Works

579
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,300
不配使用纳税人的钱
warranted taxpayer money,

580
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,970
-那就不能立法  -听我说
- then it's not fit to be law. - Now, look.

581
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,370
这是两党领导人第一次一起
This is the first time that the leaders of both parties

582
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,890
跟我同处一室会面
have met with me in one room,

583
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,470
而且不是因为我没邀请过你们  是你们拒绝了
and not because I didn't invite you, because you declined.

584
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,460
既然我们都在这里  那就充分利用这次机会
So, now that we're here, let's make the most of it.

585
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,150
我愿意在联邦应急管理署方面让步
I'm willing to walk back on FEMA

586
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,500
前提是让《美就法》进入国会投票
if we can discuss putting AmWorks on the floor.

587
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,110
你们在教育法案上威逼过我们
You bullied us on the Education Bill.

588
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,090
还有政府停摆
And the government freeze.

589
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,580
这次不会成功的
It's not gonna work this time.

590
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,200
等它成功了  你再说这话吧
You watch it work and then tell me it didn't.

591
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,080
我们要起草法律  说这样使用赈灾基金是违法的
We're drafting a law, saying this use of the DRF is illegal.

592
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,220
谁来执行这项法律
And who's going to enforce that law?

593
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,210
我们曾准备弹劾一位总统
We were ready to impeach one president.

594
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,050
如果有必要  也会对你采取相同措施
We'll do the same with you if necessary.

595
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,350
然后让唐纳德·布莱斯坐进这间办公室吗
And put Donald Blythe in this office?

596
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,130
你们也知道他干不了这份工作
You know he's not up for the job.

597
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,930
国会会因为失职而被抨击
Congress would get killed for malpractice.

598
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,600
不管你们认为我多狡诈
As crooked as you may think I am,

599
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,480
你们清楚我可以顶住压力  而唐纳德不行
you know I can handle the pressure, and you know Donald can't.

600
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,300
你们通过法律吧  我会否决的
So pass your law, I'll veto it.

601
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,010
等你们在参议院推翻我
And when you overrule me in the Senate,

602
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,240
我们就让法庭裁决吧
we'll let the third branch decide.

603
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,700
别向国会宣战  总统先生
Don't declare war on Congress, Mr. President.

604
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,800
不是向国会宣战  我是向衰退宣战
Not on Congress. I'm declaring war on atrophy.

605
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,630
但如今谁又能看出区别呢
But these days, who could tell the difference?

606
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,170
不如这样
So how about this?

607
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,350
我叫份披萨
I'll order a pizza.

608
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,780
到了之后  我拿进这个房间
When it gets here, I bring it into this room...

609
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,320
手臂上搭一条纸巾
with a paper towel draped over my arm.

610
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,540
来了  就像客房服务
Voilà. Just like... room service.

611
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,470
你不让你的孩子吃披萨
You don't let your kids eat pizza.

612
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,340
因为我见识过那对颈动脉的危害
Well, because I've seen what it does to a carotid artery.

613
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,140
而且你又不是我的孩子
And you're not my kids.

614
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,990
你觉得他们喜欢我吗
Do you think they like me?

615
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
他们崇拜你
They adore you.

616
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,250
马特问你能不能教他开车
Matt asked if you could teach him how to drive.

617
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,360
-真的吗  -嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

618
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,290
他说你不会那么苛刻
He says you'd be less judgmental.

619
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,010
你想结婚吗
Do you want to get married?

620
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,190
跟你还是笼统来说
To you, or in general?

621
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,380
我是认真的
I'm serious.

622
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,650
从哪冒出的想法
So where'd this come from?

623
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,250
我们都谈过了
We've talked about it.

624
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,980
我们说"我爱你"
We say "I love you."

625
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,910
我想要个丈夫  你想要个妻子
I want a husband. You want a wife.

626
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,910
我们俩挺合适  你不觉得吗
This works, the two of us, don't you think?

627
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,290
-非常浪漫  -我们不是浪漫过了吗
- It's very romantic. - Aren't we past romance?

628
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,660
我给你买了个戒指
I bought you a ring.

629
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,560
你为什么都没说
Why didn't you say anything?

630
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,960
不然怎么是惊喜
It's the element of surprise.

631
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,220
不就是要有惊喜吗
That's kind of the point, isn't it?

632
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,390
在我的储物箱里  你想要的话我去拿
It's in my glove compartment. I can go get it if you want.

633
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,830
不  我要你定披萨
No, I want you to order the pizza.

634
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,250
明天再弄戒指的事
We can do the whole ring thing tomorrow.

635
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,460
你什么时候回来的
When did you get in?

636
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,720
-几小时前  -过来坐吧
- Couple of hours ago. - Well, come and sit down.

637
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,020
我觉得我好像有三天没见到你了
I feel like I haven't seen you for what, has it been three days?

638
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,470
应该是四天
Four, I think.

639
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,290
都记不清了
It's just all been a big blur.

640
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,290
我在纽约也一样
Same in New York.

641
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,260
有好消息吗
Any luck?

642
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,720
他们跟复读机似的  弗兰西斯
They're like a broken record, Francis.

643
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,670
需要我给总理打电话吗
Do I need to call the prime minister?

644
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,080
一通电话可能解决不了
Oh, I think it's gonna take more than a phone call.

645
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,600
-说说吧  -其实我不是为这个来的
- Tell me. - That's not why I'm here, actually.

646
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,120
这几个月的事太多
So much has been going on in the past few months,

647
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,600
咱俩都没时间聊聊了
we hardly have time to talk.

648
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,030
用这个
Here, use this.

649
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,290
那晚你要睡我的床
I feel bad about the other night

650
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,170
我不该赶你走
when you wanted to sleep in my bed.

651
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,430
不用自责
Oh, that. You shouldn't.

652
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,040
我就是
I just--

653
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,030
我也不知道为什么在那边睡了
I don't know why I started sleeping in there.

654
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,980
没记错的话是你感冒了
Well, if I remember correctly, you had a cold.

655
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,640
但我为什么没回去
But why I stayed.

656
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,310
你不用解释
You don't have to explain.

657
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,570
我想说我爱你
I want you to know that I love you.

658
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,600
不是因为这个
It has nothing to do with that.

659
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
我像以前一样爱你
I love you... as much as ever.

660
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,080
不用说了
Not another word.

661
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,940
明早继续谈以色列的事吧
Let's finish talking about Israel in the morning.

662
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,930
你说一通电话解决不了
You said more than a phone call?

663
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,070
他们需要承诺  弗兰西斯  真会出兵
They need it in stone, Francis, that we'll contribute troops.

664
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,960
-行政命令  -国会肯定不乐意
- An executive order. - Congress won't be happy.

665
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,920
反正已经不开心了
Well, they're already not happy.

666
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,640
恶心了他们一次  就不在乎第二次了
I spat in one eye, I might as well spit in the other.

667
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,250
没问题
Consider it done.

668
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,350
谢谢  谢谢你的支持
Thank you. Thank you for your support.

669
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,690
非常感谢  谢谢
Thank you so much. Thank you.

670
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,760
谢谢  可以啊
Thank you. Oh, sure.

671
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,740
拍到了吗
Did you get it?

672
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,090
谢谢  非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you so much.

673
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,470
谢谢  谢谢你的支持
Thank you. Thank you for your support.

674
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,210
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

675
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,090
我喜欢你的演讲  邓巴女士
I liked your speech, Ms. Dunbar.

676
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,450
我听过的演讲可多了
And I've heard more than a few.

677
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,950
非常感谢  先生
I appreciate you saying that, sir.

678
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,880
我知道爱荷华州人不容易取悦
I know Iowans aren't easily impressed.

679
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,760
你之前怎么说正直来着
What you said about integrity?

680
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,300
你要是保证做位正直的总统
Well, if you can bring that to Washington,

681
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,410
我党团会议就支持你
I'll caucus for you.

682
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,410
一次争取一名支持者  选举就得这样
One supporter at a time. That's how we'll win this.

683
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,090
那个小伙子  我替他难过  他令人振奋
And that young man? I feel for him. He's an inspiring individual.

684
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,840
约翰  来见见这位先生
John, there's someone I want you to meet.

685
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,710
-您叫什么  -克莱夫·雷诺兹
- Your name, sir? - Clive Reynolds.

686
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,700
-雷诺兹先生  幸会  -我在为你丈夫祈祷
- Mr. Reynolds, nice to meet you. - I'm praying for your husband.

687
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,760
他还在俄罗斯真是可惜
It's awful he's still stuck there.

688
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,780
谢谢  雷诺兹先生
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

689
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,940
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

690
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,130
谢谢你们的支持  谢谢你们前来
Thank you for your support. Thank you for coming out.

691
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,370
打个电话就好了
You could've just called.

692
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,550
我讨厌在华盛顿过国庆
I hate July Fourth in DC.

693
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,390
还想看看你怎么拉选票
Plus, I wanted to see you in action.

694
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
怎么样
What'd you think?

695
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,080
她得离开
I need her to leave.

696
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,560
车上见
I'll meet you at the car.

697
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,920
-希瑟  -辛西娅
- Heather-- - Cynthia.

698
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,070
看看吧
Read that.

699
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,830
安德伍德夫人要我毁掉
Mrs. Underwood asked me to destroy it.

700
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,610
-我没照做  -应该毁掉的
- I didn't. - You should have.

701
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,510
她在全国电视上说谎了
She lied on national television.

702
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,180
我不会用这种手段竞选的
I am not running that sort of campaign.

703
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,240
至少你知道手里有牌了
But it's good to know it's available.

704
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,770
我绝不会那么对一个女人
I would never do that to another woman,

705
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,440
辛西娅也不会
and neither would Cynthia.

706
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,440
选辛西娅做竞选经理挺不错
Cynthia was a good choice for your manager.

707
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,540
她肯定能经营好团队
She'll run a top-notch operation.

708
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,180
但你需要有人做一些
But you need someone who's willing to do the things

709
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,030
她下不去手的事
that people like her won't do.

710
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,720
你要我聘用你的时候
When you asked me for a job,

711
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,110
你说你想翻开新的一页
you said you wanted to turn over a new leaf.

712
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,140
我的技能很固定  邓巴女士
I have a certain skill set, Ms. Dunbar.

713
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,040
对我来说  翻开新的一页
For me, turning over a new leaf

714
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,630
就是为好目的使用我的技能
is using my skills for the right reasons.

715
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,730
比如帮你当选
Like putting you in office.

716
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,420
15万  广告投入的1%
One-fifty. One point on the ad-buy.

717
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,010
广告投入不行
No points.

718
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,600
但帮我赢得提名
But I'll do a hundred thousand win bonus

719
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,510
给你十万奖金
if we get the nomination.

720

723
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,320
我们需要的宣布时间比那早很多
We wanted you to announce a lot earlier than that.

724
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,390
不  不是宣布参选  是这个

从没见你这么少女心
I've never seen you be this girly.

这他妈是钻戒啊  少女一下怎么了

真的吗
Are you?

731
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,380
抱歉  我不该那么说
Sorry. That wasn't fair.

732
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,980
也许我们该谈谈宣布竞选的时间
Maybe we should talk about dates for announcing the campaign.

733
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,060
对  我想到几个时间  让我看下日程表

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,590
你刚才说下下周吗

740
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,330
-大使在里面  -你要我进去吗

她只是在化妆

742
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,830
我可以等她出来

743
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,970
她会直接去机场  如果您不介意的话

你可以当我是男卫生间的大使
You may consider me an Ambassador from the men's room.

748
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,840
别逗我笑  否则我就得重化

749
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,820
-怎么样  -很美
- Good? - Quite.

750
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,230
亚历克西  我们之前一直有敌意
Alexi, I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.

751
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,840
我们得找到更好的合作方法
We need to find a better way to work together.

752
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,850
你要撤回决议案吗
You're letting go of the resolution?

753
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,060
-眼妆呢  -堪称完美
- Eyes? - Perfect.

754
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,280
听听男人的看法总是好事
It's always nice to have a man's opinion.

755
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,730
顺便说下  你是对的

756
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,870
只有我们派兵  以色列才会支持我们
Israel won't back us unless we commit troops.

757
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,020
你识破了我的虚张声势  亚历克西
You called my bluff, Alexi,

758
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,110
而我就不该如此  这是侮辱你
and I shouldn't have insulted you with one in the first place.

759
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,640
我去外面等你了
I'll be outside when you finish.

760

763

耶路撒冷已知晓此事
Jerusalem has been informed.

764
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,080
你丈夫并没有这种权利
Your husband doesn't have that kind of authority.

765
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,800
那是占领区  他并未向他国领土派兵
It's occupied territory. He's not deploying on sovereign land.

766
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,200
作为三军统帅
So, as Commander in Chief,

767
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,610
他不需要得到国会批准
he doesn't need Congressional approval.

768
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,500
以色列又与我们同一阵线了  亚历克西
Israel's back on board again, Alexi,

769
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,080
只要你们向伊朗出售军火
so the moment you sell arms to Iran,

770
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,830
我们会击落运输机  击翻货运卡车
we will shoot the planes out of the sky, the trucks off the road,

771
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,530
击沉货船
and the ships out of the water.

772
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,550
也许你们不怕遭到制裁
Now... maybe you'd be able to afford sanctions...

773
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,510
但你们绝不敢挑起战争
but you sure as hell can't afford a war.

774
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,550
重新回到谈判桌上来  与我们真诚谈判
Come back to the table. Engage us in good faith.

775
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,870
否则下周决议案就将进入表决环节
Or the resolution goes to a vote next week.

776
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,420
我一直很愿意与你磋商

777
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,320
我不是说你与我  是总统间的对话
Not you and I. President to president.

778
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,160
我们还需要你们释放迈克尔·科里根

779
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,100
我会将你的意思传达给莫斯科
I'll communicate your message to Moscow.

780
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,360
麻烦了  能给我递张纸巾吗
Please. Hand me a towel, would you?

781
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,160
真有绅士风度
What a gentleman.

782
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,060
你以前来过白宫吗
You ever been to the White House before?

783
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,950
赢得国家图书奖的时候来过

-南茜是书迷  -真是出乎我意料

785
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,000
那个故事可不怎么体现家庭价值观
That story doesn't exactly revere family values.

786
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
她流着占星家的血
She's got the astrologer in her.

787
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,200
我觉得她最喜欢的就是标题
I think she liked the title more than anything.

788
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,630
《天蝎》这书很不错
Scorpio was a very good book.

789
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,650
-够糊口而已  -请坐
- Still pays the rent. - Have a seat.

790
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,650
为什么让我来  总统先生
Why am I here, Mr. President?

791
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,570
雷米跟你解释过
Remy briefed you.

792
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,350
他说你需要本书  但没说题材是什么

799
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,630
这种文章  我并不擅长
This sort of thing... it's not in my wheelhouse.

800

就能说服我做一位沉默的公主

817
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:07,040
想想看你这本书将能说服多少人

你就是推销员  托马斯

我也要你这么对待我的故事

不要推销  只描述你的探究

再说  这种书一般都很无聊  保守

Thomas, at best, I'm going to be a footnote in history

842
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,090
那都算好  搞不好还会沦为笑柄
if I can't help those people. At worst, I'll be a joke.

843
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,660
我跟他们一样

我得按我自己的方式写
I'd need to be able to write it the way I want to write it.

858

00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,180
就像政客总忍不住乱许诺言一样
just as no politician can resist making promises he can't keep.

863
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,480
维克多  受邀前往是我们的荣幸

870
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,700
表决暂缓
Hold off on the vote?

871
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,050
等谈了再说  不过留着这一手
Until we sit down. But we keep it in our back pocket.

872
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:38,820
迈克尔·科里根呢
Michael Corrigan?

873
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,840
我们到访的时候释放他
They're going to release him when we visit.

874
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,080
你造就了奇迹
You made a miracle happen.

875
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,700
是我们
We did.

876

每一位独一无二的公民都影响着未来
...each unique citizen contributes to our future.

877
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:58,740
能大点声吗
Can you turn that up?

878
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,080
我们的先辈宣布独立时
Our forefathers, when they declared independence,

879
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,050
就理解个体的力量
understood the power of the individual,

880
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,830
自主的价值
the value of self-determination.

881
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,240
他们把我们从暴政中解放出来
They freed us from tyranny.

882
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,660
-他们证明了...  -他就是暴君

不好说  那里那么多人

884
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,850
他也许做对了
He might be onto something.

885
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,250
下行政命令调派维和部队  他疯了吧
Executive Order for UN troops? He's out of control.

886
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,810
至少他有所行动  沃克什么都没干
At least he's doing something. Walker didn't do shit.

887
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,560
我们弹劾了个哑炮  换了个原子弹
I think we replaced a dud with an atom bomb.

888
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,660
他们的自由是抗争得来的
They had to fight to secure their freedom.

889
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,970
如今我们也要通过抗争保住自由

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}奥巴马上任后最重要的一个法案
是被称为"奥巴马医改"(Obamacare)的《医疗改革法案》
在经过艰苦的谈判后  这个法案被带到参众两院进行投票
按正常程序  法案需要经过至少两轮投票
在投票过程中要进行一些修改
当时奥巴马所属的民主党在参众两院都处于多数党位置
法案通过似乎没有悬念
但在投票开始后  马萨诸塞州一名民主党参议员突然过世
补选上来的是一名共和党议员
这使民主党在参议院失去了绝对多数
奥巴马费尽心血的法案面临夭折的风险
这时  在奥巴马的支持下
众议院议长佩洛西将这个旨在改革医疗政策的法案
定性为"预算法案"  从而避免了这个法案在参议院进行新的投票
"奥巴马医改"靠这个不是很光明正大的办法成为了法律
