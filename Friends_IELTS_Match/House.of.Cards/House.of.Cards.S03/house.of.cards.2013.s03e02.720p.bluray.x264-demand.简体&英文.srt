正好你提到任人唯亲  参议员
I'm glad you brought up nepotism, Senator.

33
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,160
如果总统是直接任命
Um, if this were an outright appointment,

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,140
情况肯定不同
that would be one thing,

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,020
但他只能提名我而已
but in this case, the president can only nominate.

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,950
我的能力得由参议院认可
It's the Senate that deems me worthy.

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,410
我正是来博得你们的认可的
I'm here to convince you that I am.

38
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,870
不过说实话
Although, I must admit,

39
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,980
我丈夫上完厕所从不放下马桶圈
my husband never remembers to put the toilet seat down,

40
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,430
他也可能是想补偿我
so he could be trying to make it up to me.

41
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,820
我更担心的是你缺乏经验
My larger concern is your experience. You have very little.

42
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,130
十年前  我成立了个小慈善组织
Well, a decade ago, I founded a small nonprofit

43
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,060
后来影响力逐渐遍及全球
and I built it into a major global player.

44
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,010
我代表我的组织在国会通过了数项法案
I shepherded a number of bills through Congress on its behalf.

45
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,790
而去年一年
And over the last year,

46
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,850
我都致力于性侵法案改革
I've dedicated myself to sexual assault reform,

47
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,970
已经取得可喜进展
and have made meaningful strides.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,150
虽然算不上治国才能
Now, while this may not qualify as statecraft,

49
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,010
但也表明了我的能力
it does illustrate my effectiveness,

50
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,780
我也希望在联合国发挥我的能力
the same effectiveness I plan on bringing to the United Nations.

51
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,120
谢谢  安德伍德夫人  我放弃我剩余的时间
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood. I yield the remainder of my time.

谢谢  主席先生
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

54
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,490
安德伍德夫人  我细问一下
Mrs. Underwood, allow me to get specific.

55
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,940
您对联合国9214号决议
What is your take on UN Resolution 9214,

56
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,140
强行赦免刚果境内
the imposition of sanctions on the Congo for the--

57
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,220
非法采煤以及走私煤矿行为的看法吗
The illegal mining and smuggling of mineral resources.

58
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,790
是的  美国投了反对票
Yes. The United States voted against this resolution.

59
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,310
刚果共和国经济本就欠发达
The DRC is already wracked with economic hardship,

60
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,250
再加上政治局势不稳定
compounded by an unstable government.

61
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,320
煤矿几乎是唯一的人均GDP来源
It ranks 192 out of 194 in GDP per capita.

62
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,750
我认为我们应该鼓励外国资本进入
I think we need to encourage foreign investment

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,280
发展新的经济增长模式
and develop new forms of economic growth

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,500
而不是让刚果一穷到底
rather than make one of the world's poorest countries even poorer.

65
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,230
从国家安全角度考虑
From a national security perspective,

66
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,450
刚果的繁荣发展
the United States maintains

67
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,550
仍对美国是有利的
a strong interest in the success of the DRC.

68
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,710
-我们需要刚果稳定...  -他们来了
- We want a stable nation... - They're here.

69
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,540
...才能助我国对抗
...that can help us in combating the spread

70
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,910
极端伊斯兰分子在非洲的扩散  肆虐
of Islamic radicalism throughout the continent.

71
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,520
要做到这点  我们得做他们的盟友
And in order to achieve that, we need to work as its ally,

72
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,190
而不是监督人
not its disciplinarian.

73
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,590
早上好
Good morning.

74
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,950

-细化过的...  -先生  开始之前
- is the comprehensive breakdown-- - Sir, before we begin--

80
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,130
鲍勃  我知道你对法案还有疑虑
Look, Bob, I know you have some serious doubts about this program.

81
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,080
先让我把它亮出来
But just let me flesh it out first,

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,590
然后你有什么疑虑  我们再解决
and then I promise we can address any questions that you might have.

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,130
-总统先生  -一千万个岗位
- Uh, Mr. President-- - Ten million jobs.

84
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,120
大家都同意这对国家是好事吧
Can we all agree that that's a good thing for this country?

85
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,580
保障全体就业
Universal employment.

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,530
这是2016年留在白宫的关键
It's the key for our keeping the White House in 2016.

87
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,730
也是唯一赢回国会多数席位的机会
It's the only chance we have of winning back majorities in Congress.

88
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,030
离大选只有18个月
Now, the election's only 18 months away.

89
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,030
我们得做点大胆  坚决的事
We need to do something bold, something decisive.

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
给我党改头换面
We need to redefine our party.

91
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,080
我们想说的就是这个
Actually, that's what we wanted to discuss.

92
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,250
我党的确得改头换面
You're right, we do need to redefine the party.

93
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,760
换个新面孔
We need to do it with a fresh face.

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,550
我们不希望您参加2016大选
2016. We don't want you to run.

95
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,810
您本就不是民选的总统
You weren't even elected to the office in the first place.

96
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,400
之前的赦免很致命  支持率非常低
The pardons hurt you. Approvals are low.

97
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,800
我们不想怪谁  先生
We're not casting blame, sir.

98
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,670
只是为党的利益考虑
We just believe that this is best for the party.

99
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,740
我猜到会有这一天  但不是这么快
I suspected this was coming, but months from now.

100
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,170
我还希望到时候能拿出点成绩
I was hoping by then I'd have something to show for my efforts,

101
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,380
用进展打消他们的顾虑
that I could preempt their doubts with progress.

102
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,170
他们很紧张  这是冲动之举
They're nervous. They're being impulsive.

103
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,560
现在做这种决定太早了吧
It's a bit early to be deciding something like this.

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,290
等初选临近了再考虑吧
Shouldn't we revisit this when we're closer to the primaries?

105
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,880
你说呢  泰瑞
What do you think, Terry?

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,590
您也说了  我们离大选只有18个月了
Like you said, sir, we only have 18 months until the general.

107
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,770
离爱荷华州大选不到9个月了
Less than half of that to Iowa.

108
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,630
我们想尽快确定候选人
We would want to settle on a candidate soon.

109
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,200
全党一致支持的人
Someone who the whole party can get behind

110
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,130
就像共和党的门多萨
like the Republicans are getting behind Mendoza.

111
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,390
是谁呢
And who would that be?

112
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,870
还没讨论过
We haven't had a discussion on that yet.

113
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,330
我们出于尊重  先来找您
We came to you first, out of respect.

114
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,610
-总有几个人选吧  -还没有
- Well, there must be a shortlist. - No, not yet.

115
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,260
找到合适人选需要时间
It'll be a process to find the right person.

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,700
而我们希望您也能参与其中
And we were hoping that you would be a part of that process.

117
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,180
当然了我们只是请求  总统先生
Obviously, this is a request, Mr. President.

118
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,840
拍板的还是您
It's your decision.

119
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,410
但如果您决定参选  恕我们不能支持
But if you do run, sir, you won't have our support.

120
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,760
杰姬
Jackie?

121
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,480
我支持领导层的决定
I stand by the rest of the leadership.

122
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,060
好吧  还有许多事需要考虑
Well, this is certainly a lot to think about.

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,000
我们改天再聊《美国就业法案》的事
Let's table our discussion on America Works for another time,

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,080
不过感谢各位如此直率
but thank you all for being so forthright.

125
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,430
我稍后会就此问题给你们答复
I'll get back to you on this issue a little later on.

126
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,320
您介不介意我们先逗留一阵子
Would you like us to stick around for a while?

127
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,480
我们可不希望媒体觉得我们特地来跑一趟
We wouldn't want the press to think we came all the way here

128
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,820
-就为了五分钟的小会  -好想法
- for a five-minute meeting. - That's a very good idea.

129
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,050
不能引起非议
No raised eyebrows.

130
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,130
我会叫人送茶点到地图室的
I'll have some refreshments sent for you into the Map Room.

131
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,100
很好
Wonderful.

132
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,640
谢谢您  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

133
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,740
作为上次会议性侵法案的主要支持者
As a vocal proponent for the Sexual Assault Bill last session,

134
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,360
你是否担忧你和美国军队的关系
are you concerned about your relationship with the US military?

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
我并不担心  参议员
No, I'm not, Senator.

136
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,230
我和参联会在那项法案上合作密切
I worked closely with the Joint Chiefs on that bill.

137
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,290
假设现在缅甸有一项维和行动
What if there were a peacekeeping mission in, say, Burma,

138
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,040
镇压平民暴动
to quell civil unrest,

139
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,600
联合国要求我国出兵
and the United Nations asked us to contribute troops,

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,120
让我们的男女士兵冒生命危险
to put our servicemen and women's lives in peril.

141
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,160
如果您用缅甸做假设的话
If you're using Myanmar as a hypothetical,

142
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,420
我觉得这一段时间内还不会发生  不过作为大使
I think we're a long way from that, but as Ambassador--

143
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,500
我的问题关注的是美国军力的使用
My question concerns the use of US military.

144
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,430
美军是无关紧要的  缅甸的现状是...
The US military is irrelevant. The current situation--

145
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,080
抱歉  安德伍德夫人  美军无关紧要吗
Excuse me, Mrs. Underwood. The US military is irrelevant?

146
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,050
我不是这个意思
Well, I-- That's not what I said.

147
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,840
这是你的原话  "美军是无关紧要的"
You said verbatim: "The US military is irrelevant."

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,220
我所想表达的意思是...
Well, in the, in the context of-- I meant...

149
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,050
这其中有许多...
uh, that there are plenty--

150
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,590
我对美国军人无比尊敬  先生
I have the utmost respect and appreciation for our troops, sir.

151
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,310
你这话可不像是有多尊敬
Not with statements like that, you don't.

152
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,870
参议员  请允许我解释
Senator, if I may, I can explain.

153
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,750
我们该怎么向海外服役的男女士兵
How do we explain to the men and women who serve,

154
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,130
那些出生入死的人解释
who put their lives on the line,

155
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,100
我们驻联合国的大使认为他们无关紧要
that our ambassador thinks they're irrelevant?

156
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,840
我觉得您这样说实在是曲解了我的本意
I think that's an unfair characterization of what I intended--

157
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,290
我可没有曲解什么  安德伍德夫人
I am not characterizing anything, Mrs. Underwood,

158
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,370
话是你自己说的
you said the words.

159
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,070
而现在你又想耍花招赖掉自己的话
And now you're trying to backpedal your way out of it.

160
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,860
-您就是在断章取义  -不要打断我
- You're trying to take my words-- - Don't interrupt me.

161
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,590
如果您能不打断我的话  我可以解释的
If you will stop interrupting me, I can explain--

162
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,870
瞧  问问题的是我们  你只管回答
No, you see, we ask the questions, you answer them.

163
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,480
而您就是不让我好好回答问题  参议员
You're not allowing me to answer the questions, Senator.

164
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,480
您只顾着哗众取宠  就是不肯听我讲
If you could maybe listen instead of grandstanding.

165
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,380
你此次应征的职位
The position you're being considered for

166
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,730
要求你有冷静沉稳的外交手段
requires calm, cool diplomacy.

167
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,720
相比你对军方的言论
What concerns me even more than the military comment

168
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,060
我们更担心你的举止
is your demeanor.

169
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,980
我们就要让你这样的人去当大使吗
Is this what we're to expect from our ambassador?

170
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,050
一个急性子
A hothead?

171
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,410
那请吧  安德伍德夫人  我洗耳恭听
Go ahead, Mrs. Underwood, I'm listening.

172
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,280
也许他们别有所图
Maybe it's leverage for another play.

173
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,130
先吓破我的胆  然后漫天要价
Scare the wits out of me and then come with the big ask.

174
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,570
你确定他们有价码吗
You sure there is one?

175
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,450
他们想毙掉《美国就业法案》
America Works. They want to kill it.

176
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,470
或者逼我考虑换一个总统竞选搭档
Or soften me up to consider another VP candidate for the ticket.

177
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,000
他们不喜欢布莱斯
They're no fans of Blythe.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,860
什么事都有可能  没准要求多着呢
Could be anything, any combination of things.

179
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,700
-怎么了  -您还没看到吗
- What? - You saw it?

180
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,470
-看到什么  -第一夫人  先生
- Saw what? - The First Lady, sir.

181
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,640
天啊
Jesus.

182
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,750
我得赶紧打给她
I better call her.

183
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,390
她还在参加听证
She's still in the hearing, sir.

184
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,020
我要把整个过程看一遍  最好提前想想对策
I need to see this whole thing. Let's get ahead of it if we can.

185
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,120
-副检察长到了  -取消会面
- The Solicitor General is here. - Cancel it.

186
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,050
-您已经推迟两次了  -那再推迟一次
- You've already postponed twice. - Postpone it again.

187
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,050
不能再推迟了  先生
We can't put it off, sir.

188
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,700
还有不到一个月就要上最高法院了
It goes to the Supreme Court in less than a month.

189
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,060
我们有更大的事要处理
We have bigger fish to fry.

190
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,480
一名美国公民在无人机袭击中受伤
An American citizen was injured by a drone strike.

191
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,250
那是沃克下的令  不是我
That Walker authorized, not me.

192
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,800
但你是在任总统
But you're the sitting president.

193
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,400
如果处理不力  对你的权威会有极大损害
If we lose this, it undermines your authority.

194
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,640
媒体报道铺天盖地
The media is all over it.

195
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,930
我们必须跟副检察长统一说辞
We need our rhetoric in line with the Solicitor General's.

196
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,660
行了  老天爷  让她进来
All right. Christ! Send her in.

197
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,360
我会把片段放到您电脑上  方便您查阅
I'll put this clip on your computer, for when you're done.

198
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,160
私下联系泰瑞·乌麦克  我今天就要见他
Terry Womack. Today. Privately.

199
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,500
邓巴女士
Ms. Dunbar.

200
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,160
在我们开始前  有些话我要说清楚
Before we begin, I'd like to clear the air.

201
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,600
你的报告真的非常好  非常必要
Your report. You did good work, necessary work,

202
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,530
我对此表示敬意
and I admire you for it.

203
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,380
谢谢您的肯定  先生
I appreciate you saying that, sir.

204
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,030
你也理解我下达赦免令的考虑
And you understand the position I was in with the pardons.

205
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,210
那是政治问题  我不在行
That's politics, sir. Not my expertise.

206
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,970
那我们既往不咎了吗
What's past is past?

207
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,120
我关注的是要在法庭上说什么
My focus is the argument I'll present to the court.

208
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,940
她觉得我就是抢了银行逃到郡界的劫匪
She sees me as the bank robber who made it to the county line.

209
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,400
但她很聪明  没把这态度带进门
But she's smart enough to leave her badge at the door.

210
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,460
那么  这案子
So, the case.

211
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,780
先生  我们觉得以国家机密来辩护十分可行
As you know, sir, we think the State secret defense is strong.

212
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,680
我与中情局商议时...
When I consulted with the CIA on the--

213
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,110
我在想用国家机密做辩护是不是最好的策略
I'm wondering if State secrets is the best tactic.

214
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,020
默罕默德的两条腿都被截肢了
Both of Mahmoud's legs were amputated.

215
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,640
他会坐在轮椅上  出现在旁听席
He will be in the gallery, in his wheelchair.

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,290
这画面非常震撼
That's a powerful image.

217
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,190
就算是最高法院法官也会心软
Even Supreme Court Justices have hearts.

218
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,240
我们得让他们理性思考
We need to stay in their heads.

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,630
诉讼程序显然...
A procedural route is clearly-- -

220
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,720
稍等
Excuse me.

221
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,230
是的
Yes?

222
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,620
告诉她我得看点东西
Uh, tell her I need to watch something

223
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,990
两分钟后在书房给她回电
and I'll call her back from my study in two minutes.

224
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,580
-是我夫人  抱歉  -没关系
- It's my wife. I'm sorry. - Please.

225
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,100
-你只管回答  -而您就是不让我
- ...you answer them. - You're not allowing me

226
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,150
好好回答问题  参议员  
to answer questions, Senator.

227
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,300
您只顾着哗众取宠
Maybe you would benefit more

228
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,330
就是不肯听我讲
from listening than grandstanding.

229
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,850
我刚看完  我能做什么
I just watched. How can I help?

230
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,520
我在给各个参议员打电话
I'm calling Senators.

231
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,030
如果你也给他们打就太过了
I think it would be heavy-handed if you did too.

232
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,780
你生气我能理解
Well, I don't blame you for getting upset.

233
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,900
-你不应该受如此对待  -我成靶子了
- You didn't deserve that. - I'm a target now.

234
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,830
-这是从政的代价  -我们都是靶子
- That's the price of admission. - We both are.

235
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,760
领导层不希望我参加竞选
The leadership, they don't want me to run.

236
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,370
-什么  -他们是这么说的
- What? - Yeah, that's what they said

237
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,500
我都没来得及拿出法案
before I could even present the program.

238
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,600
-这么快吗  -是啊  我也很惊讶
- This soon? - Yeah, that's what surprised me.

239
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,540
-整个领导层吗  -所有人  包括杰姬
- The entire leadership? - All of them, including Jackie.

240
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,160
-这女人毫无忠心  -等着看吧
- That woman has no sense of loyalty. - Well, we'll see.

241
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,630
我要和乌麦克见面  让他改主意
I'm gonna meet with Womack. Turn him around.

242
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,790
他们只是人多势众
They only have strength in numbers.

243
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,180
请继续
Continue, please.

244
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,060
正如之前所说  我们的程序性抗辩很可行
As I was saying, we think our procedural defense is strong.

245
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,700
国家机密不允许被用作证据
State secrets prohibit the introduction of evidence.

246
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,490
即使他们不直接撤案
Assuming they won't dismiss outright,

247
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,740
辩论也会聚焦于遵从行政命令
the argument will focus on deference to the executive.

248
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,890
法院和外交政策的独立性
Separation between the courts and foreign policy.

249
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,640
我们面对来自多领域的威胁
They simply don't have the security intelligence

250
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,320
他们根本没有足够的安全情报
to second-guess covert operations

251
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,610
事后指戳秘密行动的合理性
while we're facing threats on multiple fronts.

252
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,680
先生
Sir?

253
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,890
-我现在无法处理  -您说什么  先生
- I can't do this now. - Excuse me, sir?

254
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,100
我的办公室会与你联系  抱歉  谢谢
My office will be in touch. Apologies. Thank you very much.

255
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,060
您只顾着哗众取宠  就是不肯听我讲
Maybe you would benefit more from listening than grandstanding.

256
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,320
欢迎收看CNN首席国会记者
Joining me now from Capitol Hill,

257
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,470
达娜·巴什从国会发来的报道
CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent, Dana Bash.

258
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,610
达娜  现在国会意向如何
Dana, what is the mood at the Capitol?

259
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,250
没错  我理解
Right, I understand, but...

260
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,350
已经有几位参议员公开表示
We already have several Senators publicly saying

261
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,260
由于安德伍德夫人的言论
that they're gonna vote against Mrs.Underwood

262
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,720
将会投票反对她
because of her comments.

263
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,160
而另一些参议员
A number of others I've spoken to

264
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,930
从支持她
have gone from supporting her...

265
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,880
-好的  -转变为了持观望态度
- Right. - ...nomination, to being on the fence.

266
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,020
但达娜  她说的对吧
But, Dana, she's correct, isn't she?

267
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,970
门多萨就是在哗众取宠
Mendoza was grandstanding.

268
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,580
也许吧  但即便如此  看看支持率
Maybe. But even so, if you look at the numbers here,

269
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,870
这事杀伤力很大
this is doing real damage.

270
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,040
投票结果本就接近
The vote was always going to be close...

271
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,780
是的
Yes.

272
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,550
第一夫人的形势可不太好
...things aren't looking good for the First Lady.

273
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,110
-我明白  但  -她对美军的言论会是
- No, I understand, but-- - Could her military remark be...

274
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,000
-门多萨来电  -口误吗
- It's Mendoza. - ...a slip of the tongue?

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,330
感谢您接听  参议员  希望您能再考虑
I appreciate your time, Senator. I hope you'll reconsider.

276
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,310
-他在线吗  -没错
- He's on now? - Yes.

277
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,740
把电视关了
Turn that off?

278
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,900
参议员  感谢你回电
Senator, hi. Thank you for returning my call.

279
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,010
抱歉让你等这么久  我要处理一堆采访
Sorry it took so long. I had a ton of interview requests.

280
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,690
我想表示道歉
I just wanted to apologize

281
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,120
我今天无意失敬
if I came across as disrespectful in any way.

282
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,030
我不该那么说
That was wrong of me.

283
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,160
我知道你是无心的  克莱尔
I know you didn't mean it, Claire.

284
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,050
很不幸事情发展至此
It's just unfortunate how things are playing out.

285
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,760
我知道你本人不能给我投票
I realize you can't vote for me yourself,

286
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,990
但我希望也许
but I was hoping that maybe

287
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,970
你可以帮我说些好话
you would say something to the effect to--

288
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,330
什么  对媒体吗
What, to the press?

289
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,380
-或者私下里  对你同事  -不行
- Or even privately, to your colleagues. - I can't do that.

290
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,100
参议员  投票应该注重于我的优点
Senator, the vote should center on my merits,

291
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,760
而不是你我剑拔弩张的个别瞬间
not a few moments where you and I took the gloves off.

292
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,100
我觉得这很能说明问题
Well, I think that was telling, don't you?

293
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,830
你面对压力时的反应
How you behaved under pressure?

294
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,160
参议员  你知道你是在断章取义吧
Senator, you know you were taking out of context what I said.

295
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,000
知道  我故意惹怒你的
Of course I was. I was trying to rile you up.

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,430
我也成功了
And I succeeded.

297
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,490
我真后悔
I wish I hadn't,

298
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,920
因为你现在的情况真的不乐观
because it's gonna make things really tough for you.

299
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,460
但是如果你现在
But, if you can convince my

300
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,890
还能说服我的同事改变主意的话
colleagues to change their minds despite that...

301
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,060
你肯定能做个好大使的
why, you'd make a great Ambassador.

302
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,040
-叨扰了  参议员  -好运  克莱尔
- Thank you for your time, Senator. - Good luck, Claire.

303
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,680
真是个王八蛋
He's a son of a bitch.

304
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,160
试试彼得森
Let's try Peterson next.

305
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,640
支持率总会变化
Approvals go up and down.

306
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,690
我们不能被公众的想法左右
We can't allow ourselves to be held hostage by public opinion.

307
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,190
是共和党在逼我们
We're being held hostage by the Republicans.

308
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,550
由你代表我党是击败不了他们的  就这样
We can't beat them with you as the face of the party. Period.

309
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,570
你们真的考虑清楚了吗
Have you all really thought this through?

310
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,200
我是在任总统
I'm a sitting president.

311
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,650
但不是民选的
But not an elected one.

312
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,640
但就这么放弃在任者
But still, to abandon the incumbent,

313
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,730
和其所代表的影响力吗
and all the advantages that that entails?

314
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,810
问题就在这儿  你没什么影响力了
Which is the problem. We don't see any advantages.

315
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,790
如果你跟我们的路线走
And if you were to come on board with us,

316
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,820
公开宣布你不参选
if you were to announce that you're not running,

317
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,810
大家就不会觉得是我们抛弃了你
it wouldn't seem as if we're abandoning you.

318
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,880
党还是统一的
The party looks unified.

319
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,300
自从我强行通过教育法案
Bob Birch has been trying to do me in

320
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,800
鲍勃·博奇就一直计划着坑我一把
since I forced the Education Bill down his throat.

321
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,420
他是在用站不住脚的道理说服你们
I think he's using shaky logic to get you all on board

322
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,550
方便他向我寻仇
so he can carry out some personal vendetta.

323
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,200
是我的主意
It was my idea.

324
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,050
不是鲍勃的
Not Bob's.

325
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,010
希望你能跟我们合作
I hope you work with us.

326
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,680
我们说的是真心话
We meant it when we said it.

327
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,720
我们希望听取你的意见
We would like for you to be a part of the conversation.

328
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,990
-喂  -是我
- Hello? - Hey, it's me.

329
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,800
-我听不见  -等等
- I can't hear you. - Hang on a second.

330
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,110
-赛斯吗  -对
- Seth? - Yeah.

331
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,610
我就想问问你有没有事
I was just calling to check in. See how things are going.

332
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,210
没事  都挺好的
Good. Things are going really good.

333
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,020
等一下
Hey, hold on one quick second.

334
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,990
我知道
Listen, uh, I know

335
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,150
你们要推出《美就法》项目了
you're rolling out the AmWorks program soon.

336
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,520
雷米肯定已经有了计划
I'm sure Remy has a plan in place,

337
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,580
但我也列了个单子
but I've been putting together a list.

338
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,550
关键议员
Some key representatives

339
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,710
和他们可能开出的价码
and what they might want in exchange for support.

340
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
肮脏秘密什么的
Skeletons in the closet, that kind of thing.

341
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
那项法案现在搁置了
Yeah, that's on hold for the moment.

342
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,740
-不推出了吗  -就是暂时搁置了
- You're not rolling it out? - It's just on hold.

343
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,410
-出什么事了吗  -没什么事
- Is something up? - No, everything's fine.

344
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,010
现在的重点是下周俄罗斯的峰会
We're focused on the summit next month with Russia.

345
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,020
你还好吗  身体好起来了吗
But you're good? You getting stronger?

346
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,480
-嗯  -精神呢
- Yeah. - In good spirits?

347
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,620
好得不得了
Never been better.

348
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,540
我发邮件给你  他的想法记得告诉我
I'll email you my ideas. Let me know what he says.

349
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,170
-没问题  -谢谢
- Will do. - Thanks.

350
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,760
参议员  上周在办公室见面时
Senator, when we met in your office last week,

351
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,560
我们进行了一次很长很有成果的谈话
we had a long, productive conversation.

352
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,750
我觉得听证会上的十秒说明不...
I can't imagine ten seconds during the hearing would--

353
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,950
参议员先生  我五分钟后再打过去好吗
Senator, may I call you back in five minutes?

354
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,220
谢谢
Thank you.

355
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,610
-弗兰西斯  -不行  根本是他的主意
- Francis? - No luck. It was his idea.

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,100
你打算怎么做
What are you going to do?

357
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,700
找上次竞选前50的资助人
Top 50 bundlers from last cycle.

358
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,950
控制了资金我就不必靠领导层了
I don't need the leadership if I can get the money.

359
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,350
-你呢  -还没准
- You? - Too early to tell.

360
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,010
我就在这儿  需要就来找我
Well, I'm here if you need me.

361
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,040
我一直说权力比金钱重要
I've always said that power is more important than money.

362
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,380
但竞选的时候  金钱才能让权力
But when it comes to elections, money gives power...

363
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,840
有竞争力
well, a run for its money.

364
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,590
弗兰西斯·安德伍德
It's Francis Underwood.

365
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,670
你说他挺帅的来着
I thought you said he was handsome.

366
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,350
抱歉打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

367
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,110
如果她没收到说有"急事"的短信
Well, if she doesn't receive a text with the word "urgent,"

368
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,850
那就算不上约会了
it's not an official date.

369
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,840
你好  艾伦·库克
How are you? Alan Cooke.

370
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,710
-雷米·丹顿  -幸会
- Remy Danton. - Nice to meet you.

371
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,900
我去...打几个电话
I'm just gonna go, uh... take a few calls.

372
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,700
我替你点了杯咖啡
There's an espresso coming with your name on it, okay?

373
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,640
再会
Nice meeting you.

374
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,690
说说吧
So here we are.

375
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,880
我没有参与  会面十分钟前他们才通知我
I wasn't part of the decision. They told me ten minutes before.

376
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,130
他们都找谁谈竞选的事了
Who are they talking to? About running?

377
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,070
据我所知还没有
No one yet, as far as I can tell.

378
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,160
总得有个名单  哪怕还没说出来
There has to at least be a list. Even a mental one.

379
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,640
有些想法
Some ideas.

380
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,410
我们需要你查出来
We need you to find out.

381
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,860
沃克辞职的时候
You know, when Walker resigned,

382
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,940
弗兰克就任总统  你是幕僚长
Frank's president, you're Chief of Staff.

383
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,390
-我呢  -你还在领导层
- But me? - You're still in the leadership.

384
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,260
-助理党鞭  -就是扯淡
- Assistant Whip. - It's a bullshit title.

385
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,490
我不在核心圈子里
I'm out of the inner circle.

386
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,620
那你要什么
What do you want?

387
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,790
我要做他的副总统
I want to be on the ticket. His VP.

388
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,220
我们只要一点点信息
All we want is a little information.

389
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,300
你开的价  太高了吧
What you're asking is... disproportionate.

390
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,570
当做是还债了吧
It's repaying a debt.

391
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,180
好大一笔债呢  弹劾法案是我搞定的
A big one. I whipped the votes for impeachment.

392
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,110
现在我要回报了
I should get to cash in on that.

393
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,130
他是不会同意的
There's no way he'll go for this.

394
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,550
那我也没必要做你们的眼线了
Then there's no reason for me to be your eyes and ears.

395
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,750
回头联系你
I'll get back to you.

396
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,750
要在工作时间
During business hours.

397
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,860
不  马克  就在白宫的决策室  我发誓
No, Mark, we ran it in the White House screening room and I swear to God,

398
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,040
战斗机撞向海狼核潜艇的时候
when those jets crashed into one of our Seawolf subs,

399
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,000
参联会都喊出来了
the Joint Chiefs screamed.

400
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,280
他们肯定不希望你用  更不会免费给你
No, they didn't want you to use it and certainly not for free.

401
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,930
大卫  我不只是要钱
David, I'm not just asking you for money,

402
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,180
我希望你做我的竞选主席
I'm asking you to be one of my campaign chairmen.

403
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,870
那可比在总统卧室睡一晚风光多了
That buys you a lot more than a night in the Lincoln Bedroom.

404
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,040
克莱尔·安德伍德找海尔布鲁克参议员
Claire Underwood for Senator Hylbrook.

405
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,140
我同意  肯定不能只靠安全委员会的支持
I agree. We can never rely solely upon Security Counsel support.

406
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,550
斯科特  还剩18个月了
Scott, we're 18 months out.

407
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,950
你想参与进来
Now, if you wanna be on the ground floor,

408
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,640
就别想占着茅坑不拉屎
you got to shit or get off the pot.

409
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,220
关键是领导  做出榜样
The key is to provide leadership, to lead by example.

410
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,380
我还想着一起去梅德斯通打打高尔夫呢
I was hoping we could hit Maidstone for a quick eighteen.

411
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,610
当然不  我打得可差了
No, I'm a terrible golfer.

412
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,000
是啊  你就可以打败总统了
Exactly, you'd have the pleasure of beating a president.

413
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,360
以后跟人可有得讲了
Now wouldn't that be a good cocktail story?

414
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,480
我和您委员会里的共和党人差不多都谈过了
I've spoken to almost every Republican in your committee, sir.

415
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,630
他们说都听您的
Yes, they're taking their cue from you.

416
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,370
还有别的号码可以联系上他吗
Is there another number where I can reach him?

417
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,600
我今晚一定要跟他谈谈
It's important that we speak this evening.

418
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,680
是的  不管多晚
Yes, anytime, no matter how late.

419
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,600
汤姆  我只希望你多点信心
A little faith, Tom. That's all I'm asking.

420
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,490
是啊  我也不喜欢别人叫我女士
Oh, yes! I know, I don't like being called "Ma'am" Either.

421
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,120
要是我做什么事都得哄大伙开心
If I made every decision based on what makes people feel good,

422
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,190
那我就去主持脱口秀了  当什么总统
I'd be a talk show host, not the president.

423
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,290
我知道詹宁斯上将是你的好朋友
Well, I know Admiral Jennings is a good friend of yours,

424
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,740
-我可以亲自打给他  -别被恐惧左右
- I can call him personally. - Don't let fear drive you.

425
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,080
你的生意不是这么做出来的吧
That's not how you run your business, is it?

426
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,620
我知道你也曾被人曲解
I know you've been in my shoes,

427
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,000
那种断章取义不是我们本意
and sound bites are not who we are.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,230
那是省小钱吃大亏
Penny-wise and pound-foolish.

429
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,720
抱歉  参议员  吵醒你了吗
I'm so sorry, Senator, did I wake you?

430
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,730
好的  没事  我明天再挂
Yes, no, I'll try back again tomorrow.

431
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,890
你目光短浅我不怪你
I can't fault you for being shortsighted.

432
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,570
但我记性好你也别怪我
I hope you won't fault me for having a long memory.

433
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,570
晚安
Good night!

434
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,080
已经有人睡了  我明早再试
I'm waking people up now. I'll start again in the morning.

435
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,250
-怎么样  -一点也说不准
- How's it looking? - I had to flip a coin? I don't know.

436
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,900
-你呢  -还没人支持我
- You? - Not a single backer yet.

437
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,910
-一个都没有吗  -加州那边还早
- Not one? - California's still awake.

438
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,690
也许我在西海岸运气能好点
Maybe I'll have better luck out west.

439
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,940
我出去跑一圈  我得做点什么
I'm going for a run. I need to do something.

440
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,770
-太晚了  -我闲不下来了
- It's late. - Well, I'm too restless.

441
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,190
那我一个人在这儿吃晚饭了
Well, I'll be here, singing for my supper.

442
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,240
求个脸书上的毛头小子
It's humiliating to have to beg from some kid who was on Facebook

443
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,630
实在丢人  但那是...
before his testicles descended, but that's--

444
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,840
德里克  弗兰西斯·安德伍德  有时间吗
Derrick, Francis Underwood. Do you have a few minutes?

445
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,620
我绕着国家广场跑
I'll be running along the Mall tonight.

446
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,360
那要出动全套安保
That requires a full detail.

447
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,330
你们多久能准备好
How soon can you be ready?

448
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,570
我们更希望您在附近跑
We'd far prefer you ran on the track.

449
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,230
我去国家广场跑
I'll be running along the Mall.

450
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,400
好的  夫人  第一夫人安保尽快出动
Yes, ma'am. We're going to need the First Lady's detail, ASAP.

451
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,320
-不可公开  -可以
- This is off the record. - Agreed.

452
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,390
过去六个月
You've called my office every day

453
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,650
你一直给我办公室打电话  问同一个问题
for the last six months with one question.

454
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,690
领导层的人我都联系过
I call everyone in the leadership.

455
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,930
得到的都是同一套说辞
I get the same non-answer from all of you:

456
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,750
"弗兰克·安德伍德是现任总统"
"Frank Underwood is our president..."

457
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,060
我们是他坚实的后盾
He has our undivided support.

458
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,970
博奇有次说错了
Birch slipped up once.

459
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,810
他说"不可动摇"不是"坚实"
He said "unwavering" instead of "undivided."

460
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,650
我还以为他嗑药了
I wanted to drug-test him.

461
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,220
今早在白宫有过一次会面
There was a meeting this morning in the White House.

462
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,710
你们出来时我看到了
I was there on Pebble Beach when you came out.

463
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,090
一共就谈了四分半
It lasted four and a half minutes.

464
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,150
-你们进去了一个小时  -是待了一个小时
- You were in there for an hour. - We were inside for an hour.

465
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,210
但不代表就谈了一个小时
Doesn't mean the meeting lasted that long.

466
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,310
发生什么了  为什么这么快
What happened? Why so short?

467
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,740
你入围过普利策奖呢
You're the Pulitzer finalist.

468
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,000
《美国就业法案》吗
America Works?

469
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,870
总统下午是为了这个去的国会山吗
Is that why the president went to the Capitol this afternoon?

470
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,660
白宫的人都不松口
No one from the White House would say.

471
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,030
晚安
Have a good night.

472
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,500
你选了我  你想干什么
You chose me. What's your play?

473
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,310
只要是写总统的  人们都会关注
When you write about presidents, people pay attention.

474
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,770
得最后定胜负了
It'll come down to the wire.

475
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,340
我有信心  但我也不希望有什么事听天由命
I'm confident, but I don't want to leave anything to chance.

476
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,920
据艾瑞克森的消息  我今早有47票了
Well, according to Erikson, I have 47 votes as of this morning.

477
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,940
我知道  参议员  但那还不够
Well, I know, Senator, but that's not enough.

478
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,420
我还需要您的票
I need yours.

479
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,330
我绝对是要竞选总统的
I have every intention of running for president.

480
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,540
我得确定你们是支持我的
I need to know you two are with me.

481
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,460
有任何疑虑  就现在说出来
If you have any doubts, now's the time to let me know.

482
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,060
南茜  清空时间表
Nancy, wipe the schedule clean.

483
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,420
全推掉
Yes, everything.

484
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,130
不讨论出个计划就不出去
We don't leave this office until we have a plan.

485
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,090
夫人  复活节滚彩蛋游戏的事
Ma'am? The Easter Egg Roll we were scheduled for?

486
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,770
-是啊  -如果不方便...
- Right. - If this is a bad time...

487
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,860
没什么  进来吧
No, that's fine. Please, come in.

488
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,700
你好
Hello?

489
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,530

Yes... Claire Underwood. He's expecting my call.

490
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,080

Hi, Sheila. They're beautiful.

491
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,240
摆一下好吗
Would you mind setting them up, please?

492
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,300
我还要打几个电话
I have a couple more calls to make.

493
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,110
参议员  我挺好  您好吗
Hello, Senator. Yes, I'm well. How are you?

494
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,650
提名华盛顿特区克莱尔·安德伍德

这可不止是粉色了  几乎是霓虹色了
This is more than pink. It's neon.

503
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,270
-我要选四个吗  -是的  夫人
- Uh, I'm choosing four? - Yes, ma'am.

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,210
都很特别
These are really special.

508
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,860
黑蛋吗
A black egg?

509
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,160
-有爱国元素点缀  -那也是黑蛋

510
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,140
刻着美国总统与第一夫人的签名

511
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,540
夫人  最后结果  52对48
Ma'am? Final tally: 52 to 48.

512
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,680
反对占多
Against.

513
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,070
-媒体呢  -在通气室

514
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,780
我就回来  稍等一下好吗
I'll just be a few minutes. Would you mind waiting?

515
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,880
当然  夫人
Not at all, ma'am.

516
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,250
我听说了
I just heard.

517
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,210
真遗憾

518
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,990
媒体等着呢

519
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,500

要我陪你去吗
Do you want me to come with you?

521

522
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,810
克莱尔  你...
Claire. You--

523
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,670
早上好
Good morning.

524
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,340
参议院没有通过我的提名  
Naturally, I'm disappointed

525
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,600
我自然很失望
that the Senate did not confirm my nomination today.

526
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,340
但能得到这个机会  我已经很感激
But I'm very grateful to have been afforded the opportunity.

527
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,090
我自然要谢谢我的丈夫
I'd be remiss if I did not thank my husband

528
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,560
感谢他对我的支持与信任
for all the faith and trust he placed in me.

529
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,950
他一向支持我实现梦想
He's always supported me in achieving my goals.

530
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,070
我期待继续履行第一夫人的职责
I look forward to continued service as First Lady.

531
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,470
谢谢
Thank you.

532
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,820
选绿的  蓝的  和米色的吧
Um, let's go with the... green, the blue, and the cream.

533
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,900
纪念彩蛋呢  可以说是金券
And for the rare one? The Golden Ticket, so to speak?

534
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,210
红的  红的好看
Red. That one's beautiful.

535
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,280
谢谢  我先走了
Thank you. Excuse me, please?

536
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,480
你试过吗
You ever try to do this?

537
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,520
让蛋立住
Balance an egg?

538
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,700
我们小时候常玩
We used to do this as kids.

539
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,770
物理法则是没法改的吧
You can't change the laws of physics, can you?

540
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,590
我错了  太难了
I was wrong. It's too hard.

541
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,370
先生
Sir?

542
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,520
对抗领导层  筹集竞选资金
Fighting the leadership, raising money.

543
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,840
不能强迫他们做极不情愿的事
We can't get them to do what they're dead set against doing.

544
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,950
现在是负分  要拉到零都需要六个月
We'd need six months just to get them back to square one.

545
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,210
得逆向思维
We have to reverse our thinking.

546
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,620
当强风袭来的时候
When the wind's blowing at gale force,

547
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,990
没有必要逆风航行
there's no point in sailing against it.

548
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,000
您有什么主意
What do you have in mind?

549
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,910
请接白宫法律顾问办公室
The White House Counsel's office, please.

550
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,270
我不管他们有什么安排
I don't care about their schedules.

551
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,620
今天凑不齐那就明天早上
If not today, tomorrow morning.

552
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,850
我们还请杰姬来吗
Should I invite Jackie, too?

553
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,750
她毕竟还算是领导层里的
Well, she qualifies as leadership.

554
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,860
-那她的条件呢  -先拖着
- What about her ask? - Stall her for now.

555
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,610
看看会面怎样再说
Let's see how the meeting goes.

556
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,110
你给我写份讲稿  要字斟句酌
I want you to write the speech, every word.

557
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,700
-好的  先生  -不得外泄
- Yes, sir. - And no leaks.

558
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,680
三小时内给您草稿
You'll have a draft in three hours.

559
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,400
另外  道格给我发了份《美就法》的游说策略
And, sir... Doug emailed me a lobbying strategy for AmWorks.

560
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,270
-您要看一看吗  -他自己写的吗
- Do you want to look at it? - Of his own accord?

561
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,100
-你没告诉他吧  -我什么都没说
- You didn't tell him? - No, I didn't say a word.

562
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,070
肯定是他看新闻自己琢磨出来的
It must be what he gathered from watching the news.

563
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,220
-他怎样了  -道格听起来还行
- How is he? - Uh, Doug seems fine.

564
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,940
按您的要求  我一直在给他打电话
I've been calling him, like you asked.

565
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,420
-但他看起来如何  -他告诉我一切都好
- But he seems all right? - Well, he tells me things are good,

566
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,830
不过我估计就算不好他也不会说的
although I don't think he'd admit it if they weren't.

567
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,120
不如你抽空去看看他  我抽不出身
Why don't you stop by from time to time, since I can't.

568
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,630
-要亲眼见到他  -好的  先生
- See him in person. - Yes, sir.

569
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,820
把他的策略转给我
And send me his email.

570
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,710
克莱尔
Claire?

571
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,400
如果你找我  我就在书房
I'll be in my study if you need me.

572
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,670
你忙什么呢
What're you working on?

573
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,800
-给你带了杯咖啡  -你可救了我的命了
- Brought you a coffee. - My savior.

574
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,060
党领导层昨天开了个会
The leadership meeting yesterday morning.

575
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,930
只持续了四分半
It lasted four and a half minutes.

576
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,180
你从哪听说的
Where'd you hear that?

577
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,820
这么重大的内政议题不可能这么快就否了
That's not long enough to reject a major domestic agenda.

578
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,980
我又没出席  我怎么知道会开了多久
I wasn't in the meeting. I don't know how long it lasted.

579
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,830
-出了什么事  -随你怎么说了
- Something went down. - If you say so.

580
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,800
反正我是什么都没听说
Uh, I didn't hear anything about it.

581
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,640
没准是总统有急事先走了
Could've been the president was called away.

582
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,560
-经常这样  -这次不是
- That happens all the time. - Not this time.

583
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,930
你怎么知道
How do you know?

584
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,740
显然我有个知道的比你多的消息源
Clearly, I have a source that knows more than you.

585
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,620
大多数消息源都这样  至少是假装这样
Most sources do. At least they pretend they do.

586
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,180
多谢你的咖啡
Thanks for the coffee.

587
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,850
加两包糖  我下次会记得的
Two sugars next time. I'll remember that.

588
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,990
你和艾拉·萨伊德谈过了
You talked to Ayla Sayyad.

589
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,770
我既可以帮忙也可以帮倒忙
I can either be an asset or a liability.

590
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,760
你以为这样就能保你成为竞选搭档了吗
You think this puts you on the ticket now?

591
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,140
你去告密的话自然不会了
Not if you tell him.

592
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,660
不过比较聪明的选择是替我说好话
But the smart move would be to advocate on my behalf.

593
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,920
别逼我  杰姬
Don't strong-arm me, Jackie.

594
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,490
你是中间人  不逼你逼谁
You're the man in the middle. Who else would I strong-arm?

595
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,420
我想成为你们的一员  雷米
I want to be on your team, Remy.

596
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,720
我们合作的时候结果一向不错
We do well when we're on the same team.

597
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,420
你还有别的电话吗
You have more calls?

598
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,510
没有  忙完了
No. I'm done.

599
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,770
-谁向她泄密了  -我不知道  先生
- Who spoke to her? - I have no idea, sir.

600
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,480
-你的工作就是知道  -事情发展太快
- Well, it's your job to know. - Things are moving fast.

601
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,720
我只想尽力控制局面
I'm just trying to stay ahead of them.

602
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,160
我们动作得再快点  会面定下来了吗
Well, we need to move faster. Has the meeting been set?

603
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,790
明早8点  博奇的办公室刚给我回了话
Eight AM tomorrow. I just heard back from Birch's office.

604
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,020
很好  联系媒体准备好9点直播
Good. Let's have the networks ready to go live by nine.

605
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,440
还有个问题  杰姬
One more thing. Jackie.

606
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,100
我觉得你最好尽快做决定
I think you should decide sooner rather than later.

607
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,970
如果我们走这条路
If we're gonna go this route,

608
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,140
就得争取尽可能多的友军
we need every ally we can get.

609
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,110
等开完会  我们再谈
After the meeting. We'll discuss then.

610
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,860
你起来了啊
You've emerged.

611
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,970
我小睡了一觉  昨晚我都没怎么睡
I took a nap. Last night was... I didn't get much sleep.

612
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,500
我也是
Me, neither.

613
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,810
我们肯定会给你找个职位的
We're gonna find something for you.

614
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,080
其它的职位  或作为第一夫人的职责  我保证
Some other position, or something as First Lady, I promise.

615
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,860
我知道
I know.

616
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,670
-你不睡做什么  -我在忙我的演说
- What are you doing up? - I've got to go over my speech.

617
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,850
我准备明晚发表演讲
It's happening tomorrow night.

618
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,170
什么演讲
What speech?

619
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,040
有点太急了  不是吗
It's premature, isn't it?

620
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,070
读下去
Read on.

621
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,050
好吗
Yes?

622
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,280
好
Yes.

623
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,630
谢谢  请坐
Thank you. Please.

624
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,160
你们的请求  我想了很多
I put a great deal of thought into what you've all asked of me.

625
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,260
我让自己尽量保持开放的态度
I challenged myself to keep an open mind.

626
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,940
而我的决定是  我将不参选下任总统
And my decision is: I will not run for president.

627
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,760
他们觉得这好的不真实  也的确不是真的
Look, they're thinking it's too good to be true, and it is.

628
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,450
我之前在椭圆办公室撒过谎
I lied in the Oval Office before.

629
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,100
这次不想再触霉头
I didn't want to take the chance this time.

630
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,280
万一真说中了可不好
It's too big a deal to jinx myself.

631
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,810
今晚9点
At nine o'clock tonight,

632
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,320
我就向全国宣布我的决定
I will announce to the nation my decision.

633
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,820
你什么目的
What's the catch?

634
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,490
我要大家来这里见面是有原因的
I wanted us to meet here in this room for a reason.

635
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,990
过去五个月
For the past five months,

636
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,830
我的团队就坐在这儿  起草《美国就业法案》
my team has sat at this very table, developing America Works.

637
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,020
你们知道这项目对我意义重大
You know how much the program means to me,

638
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,550
我希望你们也能像我一样重视
and I want it to mean as much to you.

639
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,740
-那你是有目的的了  -不  是机遇
- So there is a catch. - No, an opportunity.

640
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,190
我们都知道
Look, we all know the--

641
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,330
单纯地打个比方
All right, let's just say for... argument's sake

642
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,550
这张桌子
that this table here

643
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,330
就是未来一年半
represents the next year and a half, all right?

644
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,430
我们在这儿
So, this is us right now.

645
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,600
那边的尽头是大选
And down there at the end, that's the election.

646
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,920
我要是决定竞选  接下来几个月我就得筹款
Now, if I did run, I'd spend the next few months fundraising.

647
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,850
到这时左右  我要正式宣布
And then somewhere around here, I'd formally announce.

648
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,680
哪怕我赢了党内竞选
And then even if I did win the nomination,

649
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,370
比如说在这个时候
say, somewhere around here,

650
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,970
我就得面对
I'd start to have to face off

651
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,270
共和党的对手  很可能是门多萨
with a Republican challenger, probably Mendoza.

652
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,580
那可就是真刀真枪了
And then things would get brutal.

653
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,730
每天都得去做活动
Daily, daily events.

654
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,510
防御对手的进攻
Fending off attacks.

655
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,180
同时进攻对手
Launching my own.

656
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,000
你们说得对
And... you're right.

657
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,180
最后...
In the end...

658
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,610
...我可能会输
...I'd probably lose.

659
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,200
我会花18个月的时间竞选
I would spend 18 months campaigning,

660
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,720
就没有时间治国了
which would leave no time to govern.

661
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,630
你们让我看清了局势
But you have opened my eyes.

662
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,680
解放了思想
I feel liberated.

663
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,310
接下来的18个月我想专注一件事
I want to spend these next 18 months dedicated to one thing:

664
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,390
《美国就业法案》  但我需要你们的帮助
America Works. But I need your help to do it.

665
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,160
你开的价码有点高啊  总统先生
You're putting an awfully big price tag on this, Mr. President.

666
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,730
不  是你们开了高额价码
No, you've put an awfully big price tag on this.

667
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,420
你们要我占18个月的位子
You're asking me to be a placeholder for 18 months

668
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,240
而我想治国
and I intend to govern.

669
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,510
如果《美国就业法案》成功了
And if America Works succeeds,

670
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,060
那不管16年谁来竞选
then whoever you choose to run in 2016

671
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,750
都会有全党的支持
not only has the backing of a united party,

672
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,610
更会有一笔可贵的遗产
but a formidable legacy.

673
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,290
社会保障呢  社会福利呢
But Social Security? Benefits. Entitlements.

674
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,890
我们可不想推选个新人
We don't want to present a fresh face

675
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,450
反过来坑了自己
only to shoot ourselves in the foot.

676
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,130
那就别假装全党统一了
Then let's not pretend to unite the party,

677
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,830
让全党统一支持这项法案吧
let's unite the party behind this legislation.

678
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,460
肯定过不了共和党那关
We'll never get it past the Republicans.

679
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,720
我们不是来谈判的
We are not here to negotiate!

680
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,810
你要放眼未来吗  鲍勃  快放眼看啊
You want forward-thinking, Bob? Then think forward.

681
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,440
想16年推举个新人吗  想通力合作吗
You want a fresh face for 2016? You wanna work together?

682
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,680
把我的法案递交给国会吧
Then present my program to Congress.

683
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,910
如果通不过  那也没办法
And if it dies there, so be it.

684
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,830
但我们至少他妈该试一下
But I want us to fucking try!

685
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,890
我打算让位了
I am prepared to vacate this chair.

686
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,310
你们也妥协一下
Meet me halfway.

687
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,020
很快
Any moment now,

688
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,410
总统就将在东厅向全国发表直播讲话
the president will be addressing the nation live from the East Room.

689
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,170
关于总统讲话的内容
The White House has remained silent

690
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,210
白宫一直闭口不谈
on the subject of the president's speech,

691
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,490
但国会有消息称  是关于近几个月来
but sources in Congress say it will focus on the jobs initiative

692
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,150
总统一直在筹备的就业法案
he's been planning to unveil for several months.

693
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,290
该法案被称作《美国就业法案》
The program, dubbed America Works,

694
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,840
一直在秘密起草中
was developed in secret.

695
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,630
具体细节尚不明了
Any details are the by-product of speculation,

696
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,690
但有消息称  该法案
but sources suggest it will have elements

697
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,210
既有激进的内容  又有保守的成分
from both liberal and conservative agendas.

698
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,680
而共和党控制的国会
What remains to be seen

699
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,790
会不会通过该法案
is whether a Republican-controlled Congress

700
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,450
就拭目以待了
will cooperate in pushing the program forward.

701
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:24,020
自本届国会成立以来  共和党一直
The White House has faced significant opposition from the GOP

702
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,170
激烈反对白宫
since Congress began its current session,

703
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,200
很多人也推测
and many speculate

704
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,920
总统肆意行使否决权
that the president's liberal application of veto power

705
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,270
可能会导致国会高层
may leave congressional leaders disinclined

706
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,280
不愿支持他的法案
to support this new jobs program.

707
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,670
另外  自党鞭时期就支持安德伍德总统的
Additionally, many Democratic supporters of President Underwood,

708
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,770
部分民主党人士
from his days as House Majority Whip,

709
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,180
也在去年11月离开了国会
were voted out of office in November,

710
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,500
让总统在立法上的影响力进一步降低
diminishing his personal influence over legislators.

711
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,810
安德伍德政府的低支持率
Low approval ratings are a continuing concern

712
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,470
一直是个问题
for the Underwood administration.

713
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,500
国会内有消息称
And congressional sources suggest

714
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,320
处理失业问题
the choice to tackle unemployment

715
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,000
也许正是16年大选的策略
may be part of a campaign strategy for 2016.

716
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,060
最近有民调显示
Recent polls indicate that

717
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,650
不到三分之一美国人
less than one third of all Americans say they would

718
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,980
愿考虑投给安德伍德总统
consider voting for President Underwood...

719
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,250
...提高就业率仍是
...job growth has remained

720
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,770
总统竞选的热门话题
a popular platform in national elections,

721
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,430
如果今天的讲话能受好评
and if today's announcement is received well,

722
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,970
安德伍德总统的
President Underwood's

723
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,400
竞选肯定有机会因此受益
campaign certainly has an opportunity to benefit.

724
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,340
谢谢
Thank you.

725
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,060
先生  我们五秒后开始
Sir, we're ready for you in five seconds.

726
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:46,910
晚上好
Good evening.

727
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,990
一直以来  我们华盛顿的人都没说实话
For too long, we in Washington have been lying to you.

728
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,770
我们说为人民服务
We say we're here to serve you,

729
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,730
但实际上  我们却自私自利
when in fact, we're serving ourselves.

730
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,490
为什么  因为我们只想着连任
And why? We are driven by our own desire to get reelected.

731
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,860
我们渴望继续执政而忽视了治国之职
Our need to stay in power eclipses our duty to govern.

732
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,210
今晚  这到此为止
That ends tonight.

733
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,680
今晚  我告诉你们实话
Tonight, I give you the truth.

734
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,950
实话就是  
And the truth is this:

735
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,620
美国梦让你们失望了
The American dream has failed you.

736
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:21,380
努力工作  遵守规则  不保证你们能成功
Work hard? Play by the rules? You aren't guaranteed success.

737
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,900
你们孩子的生活不会比你们好
Your children will not have a better life than you did.

738
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,490
一千万美国人非常想
Ten million of you can't even get a job,

739
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,920
找工作却找不到
even though you desperately want one.

740
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,790
我们被社保  医保  医疗补助  社会福利
We've been crippled by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,

741
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,400
所牵绊
by welfare, by entitlements.

742
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,060
这才是问题的根源  福利
And that is the root of the problem: entitlements.

743
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,790
我说明白了  没有天生的福利
Let me be clear. You are entitled to nothing.

744
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,560
没有天生的福利
You are entitled to nothing.

745
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,410
美国的根基是勤劳精神
America was built on the spirit of industry.

746
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,160
未来靠自己努力  而非靠人施予
You build your future. It isn't handed to you.

747
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,670
华盛顿的问题
And the problem with Washington

748
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,550
在于没有给你们打造生活的工具
is that we haven't given you the tools to build it.

749
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,820
政府为人民服务的唯一办法
The only way for us to serve you

750
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,240
就是想办法让你们服务自己
is to give you the means to serve yourselves.

751
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,250
这就是我想要做的
Well, that's exactly what I intend to do.

752
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,710
不施舍  而是给工作
Not handouts. Jobs.

753
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,590
实实在在的工作
Real paying jobs.

754
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,390
在未来几周  民主党领导人
In the next few weeks, the Democratic leadership

755
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,190
会提出一个叫《美国就业法案》的项目
will introduce a program called "America Works."

756
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,160
其目的很简单
Its goal is simple:

757
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,440
让一千万没有工作的美国人有工作
to put the ten million Americans who are unemployed to work.

758
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,110
每一个想工作的人都会有工作
All of them. If you want a job, you get one.

759
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,550
这需要五千亿美元
The cost is five hundred billion dollars.

760
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,680
这个数目很庞大
Now, that's a lot of money.

761
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,750
为了这笔钱  我们得完全重新思考
To pay for it, we'll need to rethink Social Security,

762
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,750
社保  医保和福利政策
healthcare and benefits from the ground up.

763
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,890
我们不能维持现有的福利政策
We can't maintain the welfare state as we know it.

764
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,560
这么说很不讨人喜欢
Now, that's not a popular thing to say.

765
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,830
任何竞选者都不会说这些话
Anyone running for office wouldn't dare utter those words.

766
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,140
每一个幕僚  顾问和下属
Every advisor and consultant and staff member

767
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,670
都不希望总统候选人说这种话
would beg a presidential candidate not to say them.

768
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,880
但我可以说
But I can say them.

769
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,050
因为2016年  
Because I will not be seeking

770
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,250
我将不参与总统竞选
the Democratic nomination in 2016.

771
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,220
候选人都谨言慎行
Candidates are cautious.

772
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,560
他们含糊其辞  回避周旋  小心翼翼
They must equivocate. They dodge and tiptoe.

773
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:24,790
但我更愿离开这间办公室时  能完成有价值的事
But I'd rather leave this office having accomplished something of value

774
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,050
而不是为了再任四年而无所作为
than secure another four years having done nothing at all.

775
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,660
富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福提出新政
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ushered in an era of hope and progress

776
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,790
让美国走向希望和进步的时代
when he proposed the New Deal.

777
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,360
当时  他的改革被认为很激进
And at the time, his reforms were considered radical.

778
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,840
但他说  "这个国家需要进行
But he once said, "This country demands bold,

779
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,100
大胆而执着的实验
persistent experimentation.

780
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,380
想办法  试一试很正常
It is common sense to take a method and try it.

781
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,310
如果失败了  坦白承认  然后重新来过
And if it fails, admit it frankly and try another.

782
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,280
但重要的  是要尝试"
But above all, try something."

783
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,800
罗斯福比谁都明白
Roosevelt would have understood better than anyone

784
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,900
尝试特别办法的必要性
the necessity for trying something different.

785
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,560
新政成功了那么多年
The New Deal succeeded for many years,

786
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,990
但在新政失效前  我们得尝试更新的东西
but we must now try something newer before it fails us.

787
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,110
如果《美国就业法案》成功了  
If America Works succeeds,

788
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,040
我们将彻底改造美国梦
we will reinvent the American dream.

789
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,080
如果我们的尝试失败
If we fail in our attempt,

790
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,000
我们会坦白承认  然后重新来过
we will admit it frankly and try another.

791
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,650
但重要的  是要尝试
But above all, we must try something.

792
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,300
谢谢  天佑美利坚合众国
Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America.

793
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,270
现在是凌晨2点
It's two in the morning.

794
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,720
是啊  我刚离开白宫
Yeah, I just left the White House.

795
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,430
新闻发布会  电话  邮件
The press conference, phone calls, emails,

796
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,140
其它的明天再说
the rest can wait until tomorrow.

797
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,150
-你睡了吗  -还没
- Were you asleep? - No.

798
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,690
这地方不错
This is a cool place.

799
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,280
租金多少
How much is your rent?

800
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,480
你不是说《美就法》暂停了吗
I thought you said AmWorks was on hold.

801
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,470
当时确实是  现在不是了
Well, it was and then it wasn't.

802
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,870
领导层不想让他参选
The leadership didn't want him to run.

803
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,510
谁告诉你的
Who told you that?

804
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,190
没人  但我猜这是他那番讲话的唯一理由
Nobody. But I figure it's the only reason he'd make that speech.

805
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,280
-但他仍会参加竞选吧  -他说不会
- He's still gonna run though, isn't he? - He says he's not.

806
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,610
我永远都比你更了解他  赛斯
I know him better than you ever will, Seth.

807
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,740
他不可能不参选
There's no way he doesn't run.

808
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:28,220
这是你来的原因吗  因为他需要我帮他
Is that why you're here? Because he needs my help now?

809
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,470
不  我就是想亲自来看看你的状况
No, I just-- I wanted to check up with you in person this time.

810
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,720
-是他要你来的  -是
- He asked you to. - Yes.

811
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,450
不过我把你的邮件发给他了
I did send him your email, though.

812
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,670
-他说什么  -我不确定他看过没
- What did he say? - I'm not sure if he's read it.

813
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,800
你是不是该睡觉了
You should probably get some sleep, huh?

814
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,380
明天可是新闻团队的大日子
Big day for the press team tomorrow.

815
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,140
你可以回禀说我活得好好的
You can report back. Alive and well.

816
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,370
我时不时来看你一眼可以吗
Is it okay if I stop by now and then?

817
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,580
我有的选吗
Do I have a choice?

818
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,230
我没有  但是我又不能逼你开门
I don't, but I can't force you to open the door.

819
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,210
随便你了
Whatever you want.

820
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,570
多谢
Thanks.

821
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,070
再见
I'll see you soon.

822
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,140
邓巴女士
Ms. Dunbar.

823
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:17,370
总统先生
Mr. President.

824
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,560
上次我们谈话时我心事重重
I had a lot on my mind when we last spoke.

825
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,040
-昨晚的演讲  -是一个重大决定
- The speech last night, it was-- - Yes, it was a big decision

826
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,150
如果我之前显得心不在焉  我很抱歉
and I apologize if I was distracted.

827
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:28,200
-没事的  -来谈谈无人机袭击案
- Not at all, sir. - So, the drone strike case.

828
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,520
你一直在走国家机密的抗辩策略
You've been pursuing the State secrets defense.

829
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,510
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

830
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,950
-希瑟  我能这样称呼你吗  -请便
- Heather-- May I call you Heather? - Please.

831
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,810
美国人民反感秘密
The American people are sick of secrets.

832
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:41,320
这就是我昨晚竭力想说明的
That's the point I was trying to make last night.

833
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,400
我承诺给大家真相  现在就要履行诺言
I promised the truth, and now we're going to deliver.

834
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,390
是什么真相  先生
What truth is that, sir?

835
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,970
一名美国公民被炸断了腿
A man had his legs blown off. An American citizen.

836
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,280
我们要承认
We're going to own up to that.

837
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,210
承认是中情局实施了那次无人机袭击
We're going to admit that the CIA conducted the drone strike

838
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:56,400
-并且解释原因  -这些信息是机密
- and explain the reasons why. - That information is classified.

839
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,550
不再是了
Not anymore.

840
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,750
我准许你  公开机密
You have my permission to make the classified brief public.

841
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,660
先生  这么做在法律上不合理
Sir, that is not a sound legal approach.

842
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,720
但这正是这个国家所需要的
But it's what the country needs.

843
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,850
我们不是在向国家抗辩
We're not appealing to the country.

844
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,040
-而是九个大法官  -错
- We're appealing to nine justices. - Wrong.

845
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,530
我们要承担责任  一石二鸟地博得好感
We're appealing to both by taking responsibility.

846
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,720
是  有人被炸残  他家人被杀
Yes, a man was maimed, his family members were killed.

847
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,430
但因此  成百上千的生命得以获救
But hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives were saved as a result.

848
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,480
我明白这种情感逻辑
I understand the emotional logic,

849
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,470
-但我们不能...  -你坐在那儿对我说
- but we can't-- - You sat right there and told me

850
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,110
-就连最高法院法官也会心软  -对  但
- even Supreme Court justices have hearts. - Yes, but--

851
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,580
我不能告诉你怎么做好你的工作
Far be it from me to tell you how to do your job.

852
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,390
我这一生中  从未做过律师
I've never practiced law a day in my life.

853
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,480
但我书写法律
But I have written them.

854
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:37,790
我占着这间办公室  我知道国家需要什么
And occupying this office, I know what the country needs.

855
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,440
它需要了结
It needs closure.

856
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,360
我去写新的抗辩了
Let me work on a new argument.

857
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,490
-谢谢  希瑟  -谢谢  总统先生
- Thank you, Heather. - Thank you, Mr. President.

858
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,490
总统夫人  您想把它们放在哪
Where do you want these, ma'am?

859
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,120
只要不是这里  哪都行
Anywhere. Just not in here.

860
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,030
好
Okay.

861
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,210
-斯科特 -怎么了
- Scott? - Yes?

862
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,010
这儿还有一些
Here's a couple more.

863
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,740
*让城镇从你身边漂过*
*Let the towns drift slowly by

864
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,430
*听铁路车轮哼鸣*
*Listen to the steel rails hummin'*

865
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,640
*这就是流浪者的催眠曲*
*That's a hobo's lullaby*

866
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,800
*别为明天担忧*

867
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,440
*让明天来  任明天去*
*Let tomorrow come and go*

868
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,640
*今晚你睡在温暖的车厢*
*Tonight you've got a nice warm boxcar*

869
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,420
想不想来份花生酱果冻三明治
You want a peanut butter and jelly?

870
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,330

871
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,460
一切都还好吗

872

我想做联合国大使  弗兰西斯

我和白宫法律顾问确认过了

881
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,440
在提名被否决后
There is precedent for a recess appointment

882
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,680
有休会任命的先例
after a rejected nomination.

883
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,640
只有一次  但你肯定不是首例

我知道你在政治上会遭非议

885

我也清楚人们会认为我不配

886

他们对我会心存顾虑
They'll have doubts in me.

887
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,110
可如果我们只能走到这一步了呢
But what if... this is as far as we get?

888
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,970
如果18个月后一切都将结束

889
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,010

895
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:28,680
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国第二任总统约翰·亚当斯的夫人阿比盖尔·亚当斯
在美国独立革命时期和建国后夫君担任总统期间
一直以挚友和参谋的身份
在国家事务上给予约翰·亚当斯宝贵的意见和建议
富兰克林·罗斯福总统的第一夫人
埃莉诺·罗斯福一直坚持拥有独立的事业追求
成为第一夫人后还继续作为教师承担教学工作
同时坚持不懈地推动美国社会在人权和妇女权益方面的进步
罗斯福总统过世后  埃莉诺继续为自己的信仰和追求进行着不懈的努力
1945年  她被杜鲁门总统任命为美国首位驻联合国大使
后还成为联合国人权委员会的首任主席
她被认为是美国历史上最伟大的第一夫人

897
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:53,680
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}希拉里·克林顿是现代美国历史上
第一位在白宫西区拥有自己办公室的第一夫人
比尔·克林顿刚刚当选总统后  便力排众议
破天荒地委任自己的第一夫人来领导医疗改革
希拉里虽满腔热情
但她主导的医疗改革被国会山上的议员们打得片甲不留  惨败收场
但这没有让希拉里放弃自己的政治野心
离开白宫后  她先是成功当选纽约州参议员
继而参加了2008总统大选  虽然最后没有战胜奥巴马
但是虽败犹荣  并受命担任了奥巴马政府的国务卿
在目前美国两党紧锣密鼓地筹备2016总统大选之际
几乎所有人都认同  希拉里不仅是民主党中最有实力的潜在候选人
而且面对共和党对手也有着巨大的优势

899
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:18,680
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国政府部门大部分重要岗位的人事任命  不仅需要总统提名
还需要参议院经过听证会质询后  投票任命才能生效
当总统特别希望提名某人担任某个职位
而此人得不到议员们的认可和支持时
白宫有时候会利用参议院处于休会状态时进行提名
从而避开参议院听证这一步  让提名人直接上任
但这种"休会任命"如果经常发生  不仅会引起国会反弹
也会给选民一种不尊重民主制度的印象
2012年  奥巴马曾通过"休会任命"的手段任命了四名政府官员
但该任命在2014年被美国最高法院判定为违宪
