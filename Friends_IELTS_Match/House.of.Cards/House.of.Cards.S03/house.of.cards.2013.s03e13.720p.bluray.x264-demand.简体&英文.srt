弗兰克·安德伍德是个危险的人

权力如果掌握在不诚实的人手里

便会失去道德的指引

但中伤他的人品只能说明她已孤注一掷

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,570
他竟然能对美军战士的死因撒谎
If he will lie about the death of a US soldier,

58
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,480
那他还说了什么谎

他们看到了我看到的人

80
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,950
我说共同  因为我一个人做不来

为什么叫"凯茜"  都不是正式的名字
Why "Cassie"? It's not even a real first name.

88
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,860
那只是类似"凯珊德拉"这种名字的昵称

I know, it's really terrible.

148
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,670
她在休斯敦有家人
She has family in Houston.

149
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,870
会帮她上社区大学
They're gonna help her get into community college.

150
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,300
我真替她开心
I'm so happy for her.

151
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
你呢  你不会永远待在这里吧
What about you, eh? You're not staying here forever.

152
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,700
等我攒够钱  我想买辆车
Once I save up enough, I want to get my own car.

153
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,680
然后再攒钱买房
And have enough for my own place.

154
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,230
在桑塔吗
Here in Santa?

155
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,680
北边吧  在林子里什么地方
Up north, I think. In the woods somewhere.

156
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,420
我想念树和雨了
I miss the trees and the rain.

157
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,700
找个安静的地方
Someplace quiet.

158
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,680
换个环境
Something new.

159
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,140
嗯
Yeah.

160
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,870
你是个聪明的姑娘  丽萨
Well, you're a smart girl, Lisa.

161
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,710
你一定都会如愿的
I'm sure you're gonna get everything you want.

162
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,240
如果比安卡能做到  你就能
If Bianca can do it, you can.

163
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,160
敬比安卡  和她的新生活
To Bianca! And her new life.

164
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,880
-干杯  -干杯
- Salud! - Salud!

165
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,910
先生
Sir?

166
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,500
您觉得她明天能参加吗
Do you think she can join us tomorrow?

167
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,830
-媒体开始有疑问了  -如果我们赢了
- The press are starting to ask. - If we win,

168
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,180
而获胜演讲时她没陪伴您
it'll be strange if she isn't standing next to you

169
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,320
会很奇怪
for your victory speech.

170
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,450
如果是落选演讲就更怪了
Even stranger if you have to make a concession speech.

171
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,390
如果我要做落选演讲
If I have to make a concession speech,

172
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,650
第一夫人不在就不是我们最该担心的了
the absence of the First Lady will be the least of our problems.

173
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,240
我要去跑步  能安排安保吗
I'm going for a run. Can you arrange the detail, please?

174
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,000
夫人  如果您公开去跑步  可能会...
Ma'am, if you run in public, it might...

175
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,060
怎么
Might what?

176
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,520
抱歉  夫人  我这就去安排
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll take care of it right away.

177
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,860
不  如果我不能去跑  就说啊
No, if it's a problem with me running, tell me.

178
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,290
这可能提醒人们您不在爱荷华州
It might highlight the fact that you're not in Iowa.

179
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,420
请放这里
Right there, please.

180
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,230
安静
Quiet.

181
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,960
救命  不要
Help! No!

182
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,920
你要我再把你弄昏吗
You want me to put you out again?

183
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,590
张嘴  张开嘴
Open your mouth. Open it.

184
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,980
我不出声
I won't make any noise.

185
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,120
你敢出一声  敢动一下
You make one sound, or you move an inch...

186
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,300
-什么  -我不会的
- What? - I won't.

187
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,000
我不会叫的
I won't scream or anything.

188
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,590
纳特利将球传到...
Nataly puts the ball on the 44 ya--

189
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,930
耶稣在敲门...
Jesus is knocking on--

190
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,720
爱荷华党团会议只有不到24小时了
Less than 24 hours to go before the Iowa caucuses,

191
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,550
共和党票数分散  无人领跑
the Republicans have a broad field with no clear front-runner.

192
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
而民主党这边
For the Democrats,

193
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,740
安德伍德总统的民调数字冲劲十足
President Underwood has gained momentum in the polls.

194
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,560
很多政治专家认为民调数字的提升
A rise that many political experts are attributing

195
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,280
是得益于克莱尔·安德伍德参加了....
to the recent appearance of Claire Underwood in the--

196
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,430
所有大型民调都表示难分上下
Every major poll has it as a dead heat,

197
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,320
两名候选人都在45个百分点左右
with both candidates hovering at 45 percent.

198
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,190
还有10%的可能去参加党团会议的人
That still leaves one in ten likely caucus-goers

199
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,930
直到明晚才会做出决定
who won't be making their decision until tomorrow evening.

200
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,960
安德伍德夫人  总统电话
Mrs. Underwood, the president is on the phone for you.

201
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,580
安德伍德总统爱荷华竞选宣传的最后一天
President Underwood spent the last full day of campaigning

202
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,410
穿过全州  完成了他所有99个城镇的巡回宣传
traversing the state, completing his tour of all 99 Iowa counties.

203
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,060
-喂  -听我说
- Hello? - Listen.

204
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,280
不管明晚结果如何  我希望你陪在我身边
No matter what happens tomorrow night, I want you by my side.

205
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,270
你愿意考虑吗
Are you open to that?

206
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,570
克莱尔
Claire?

207
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,070
我早上飞过去
I'll fly out in the morning.

208
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,970
不不  你下午来就行
No, no. You can come in the afternoon.

209
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,400
你不用参加什么活动  或见媒体
You don't have to do any events or press, just...

210
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
只要我发表演讲的时候陪着我就行
be there with me when I make my speech.

211
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,040
-我同意了  -谢谢
- I said yes. - Thank you.

212
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,300
不客气
Of course.

213
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,170
昨晚
Last night...

214
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,940
别说了  我们明天见
Let's not. I'll see you tomorrow.

215
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,880
-好  晚安  -晚安
- All right. Good night. - Good night.

216
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,170
很抱歉我那么对你
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

217
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,400
真希望我能收回
I wish I could take it back.

218
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,910
我叫你安静了
I told you to be quiet.

219
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,460
我以为我杀了你
I thought I killed you.

220
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,920
我在新闻上听说你没事  我如释重负
When I heard on the news you were alive, I felt so relieved.

221
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,100
-我很怀疑  -真的
- I doubt that. - I mean it.

222
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,180
我为你祈祷
I would pray for you.

223
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,070
或许听上去很奇怪  但是真的
Probably sounds strange, but it's true.

224
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,890
我感觉很愧疚  你不该遭受那样的对待
I would, because I felt so bad. You didn't deserve what I did.

225
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,010
这都不会改变什么
None of this is going to change anything.

226
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,730
我们去哪
Where are we going?

227
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,160
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

228
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,990
还要开一会儿吗  我要尿尿
Is it gonna be a while? 'Cause I have to pee.

229
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,610
就在后面尿吧
You can pee back there.

230
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,610
那多不好  臭死了
You don't want that. The smell.

231
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,250
要么尿  要么憋着
It's either that or you hold it.

232
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,280
-那会疼的  -那真糟
- It hurts. - Too bad.

233
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,340
好啊  那我真做了
All right then, I'm gonna do it.

234
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,120
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood.

235
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,270
来  请坐
Please, come sit.

236
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,720
多谢前来
Thank you for coming.

237
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,370
我很遗憾事情闹成这样  太不幸了
I'm sorry for how everything has worked out. It's unfortunate.

238
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,670
我想你一定很不好受
I'm sure it's been difficult for you,

239
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,760
毕竟你投入了那么多心血
with all of the effort you put in.

240
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,010
就这样吗
Is this how it works?

241
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,160
他毙掉书  你来安抚我
He nixes the book, you soften the blow?

242
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,690
不  汤姆  不是那样
No, Tom, it's not that.

243
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,670
弗兰西斯根本不知道我找你来了
Francis doesn't even know I asked you here.

244
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,090
你为什么找我来
Why did you ask me?

245
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,110
因为我想问
Because I was wondering if...

246
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,330
我们是不是可以开诚布公地谈谈
we could talk honestly to each other.

247
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,680
不知道你是否愿意
If you'd be open to that.

248
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,710
-谈什么  -新罕布什尔
- About what? - New Hampshire.

249
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,990
你那天是有意让我晕过去的吗
Did you let me pass out that day on purpose?

250
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,370
我献血的时候
When I was giving blood.

251
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,320
我是让你继续说  我不知道你会晕过去
I let you keep talking. I didn't know you'd pass out.

252
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,850
你没想到吗
And you didn't see it coming?

253
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,470
你当时有话想说
You had things you wanted to say.

254
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,090
我说了什么  我昏过去之前
And what did I say... before I blacked out?

255
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,350
除了你写的  还有别的吗
Was there anything else other than what you wrote?

256
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,570
你不记得了吗
You don't remember?

257
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,540
不全记得
Some. But not all of it.

258
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,590
我是为自己问  我想知道
I'm asking for me. Because I need to know.

259
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,320
厌恶
Hatred.

260
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,120
你厌恶你和弗兰克多么需要彼此
For how much you and Frank needed each other.

261
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,050
我说厌恶了吗
I used that word? Hate?

262
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,720
是啊
You did.

263
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,540
你跟弗兰西斯
And of all the moments...

264
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,470
和我共度的这段时间里
that you spent with Francis and myself, you...

265
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,670
你认为我们是平等的吗
You believe that we're equals?

266
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,190
我被解雇了  安德伍德夫人  我不再受雇了
I got fired, Mrs. Underwood. I'm not on the clock anymore.

267
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,940
我和弗兰西斯之间的事远比你写的多
There's a lot more to Francis and me than what you wrote.

268
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,350
或许吧  但我没来得及问
Maybe so, but I never got a chance to ask.

269
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,360
那问吧  随你问
Then ask. Whatever you want.

270
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,640
你为什么没在他身边  去爱荷华州
Why aren't you with him? In Iowa?

271
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,990
我明天就去
I'm heading there tomorrow.

272
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,860
瞧
You see?

273
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,110
我问个问题  你们都不回答
I ask a question, and neither of you answer them.

274
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,180
这很累人  一遍遍敲打伪装的墙
It's tiresome, constantly swinging a sledgehammer at the façade,

275
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,040
只为了能从裂缝里一窥真相
just to get a glimpse through the cracks.

276
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,290
告诉我你看到了什么
Tell me what you see.

277
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,640
一个迷茫的人
Somebody who's lost.

278
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,330
但也不好说
But I don't know.

279
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,180
或许这样也好
Maybe it's all for the best.

280
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,680
我宁可想象你可能的样子
I'd rather imagine who you might be

281
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,870
而不是看到你真实的样子
than who you actually are.

282
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,220
祝你好运  克莱尔
Good luck, Claire.

283
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,070
够了
That's enough.

284
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,350
-能让我冷静  -那就在脑子里唱
- It calms me. - Then sing it in your head.

285
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,310
你能原谅自己吗
You're gonna be able to live with yourself?

286
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,890
这有什么意义
What's the point?

287
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,260
我伤不了你
I can't hurt you.

288
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,960
没人能找到我  或知道我是谁
No one's ever gonna find me or know who I am.

289
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,510
我永远不会说什么
I'm never gonna say anything.

290
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,500
安静
Quiet.

291
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,680
如果你是要惩罚我  没必要
If it's about punishing me, you don't have to.

292
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,820
去年一年  我不得不做的事
This last year, some of the things I've had to do,

293
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,310
我不希望任何人遭遇
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

294
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,880
我叫你安静
I said quiet.

295
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,860
昨晚的内部民调什么结果
What did the overnight internals say?

296
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,170
还是难说  只有不到半个百分点的差距
Still a toss-up. Less than half a point gap.

297
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,200
-她还是我领先  -不重要
- Her or me? - Doesn't matter.

298
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,310
误差还是4.5%呢
The margin of error is four-point-five.

299
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,390
过去几天  领跑人换了三四次了
The last few days, the lead's gone back and forth three times.

300
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,870
归根结底  看出席率
Bottom line is turnout.

301
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,810
-先生  -嗯  我就好
- Sir? - Yes, I'm almost ready.

302
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,640
我能单独跟您谈一下吗
May I speak to you for a moment privately?

303
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,330
-好  谢谢  -我就在外面
- Yes. Thank you. - I'll be right outside.

304
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,430
我刚得到消息  安德伍德夫人推迟了过来的班机
I just got word that Mrs. Underwood has postponed her flight here.

305
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,780

306
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,690
另外  斯威夫特特工  她安保的负责人
Also, Agent Swift, the head of her detail...

307
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,250
他说汤姆·耶茨昨晚去了总统府邸
he said Tom Yates came to the residence last night.

308
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,120
-告诉沃恩我马上就过去  -是  先生
- Tell Vaughn I'll be down in a few minutes. - Yes, sir.

Listen, if you breathe deeply,

313
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,640

you're gonna pass out right away.

314

救命啊
Help!

317
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,050
没人能听到  躺下  瑞秋
No one can hear you. Lie down, Rachel.

318
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,500
听着  瑞秋已经没了
Look, Rachel's gone!

319
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,940
这才是我现在的身份
That is who I am now.

320
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,400
我知道你也不想
Look, I know you don't want to do this.

321
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,640
你可以
You-- You could--

322
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,400
你昨晚在停车场就可以杀我
You could've done it in the parking lot last night,

323
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,040
但你没有  你留了我一命 
but you didn't, you kept me alive!

324
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,370
我知道你不是这种人
I know this isn't who you are.

325
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,230
求你
Please.

326
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,150
求你  求你  放我走吧
Please. Please. Please, just let me go.

327
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,720
求你
Please.

328
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,620
道格
Doug.

329
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,220
道格  求你  求你  放我走吧
Doug, please. Please. Please just let me go.

330
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,600
-求你  道格  -该死
- Please! Doug! Please! - Fuck!

331
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,250
总统又打来了
The president is on the line for you again.

332
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,370
你告诉他我不舒服了
You told him I'm not feeling well?

333
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,270
是  夫人  他还是想跟您说话
Yes, ma'am. He'd still like to speak with you.

334
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,620
告诉他我睡了
Tell him I'm sleeping.

335
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,240
我睡了  告诉他
I'm sleeping. Please tell him.

336
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,220
好的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,000
喝吧
Here.

338
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,350
你那晚为什么要逃
I don't know why you had to run that night.

339
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,750
我只想保证你的安全
All I ever tried to do was keep you safe.

340
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,120
我害怕了  没动脑子
I was afraid. I wasn't thinking.

341
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,890
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

342
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,140
我知道你是善良的
I know you have a good heart.

343
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,940
你是想劝我放你走
You're saying that because you want me to let you go.

344
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,420
看着我
Look at me.

345
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,640
看着我  道格
Look at me, Doug.

346
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,360
你不用杀瑞秋
You don't have to kill Rachel.

347
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,720
她已经死了
She's already dead.

348
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,370
她死在了那片林子里  就这样吧
She died in those woods, and it's better that way.

349
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,760
反正她过得也不好
She didn't have a very good life.

350
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,860
但是...你要是真动手
But... But if you do this,

351
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,460
杀的就不是瑞秋  而是凯茜
you're not killing Rachel, you're killing Cassie.

352
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,460
而...
And...

353
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,480
凯茜·洛克哈特只想找个僻静的地方住下
all Cassie Lockhart wants to be is someplace far away.

354
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,250
没人找得到她的地方
Someplace where nobody'll ever find her.

355
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,490
她喜欢看电影
She likes to go to the movie theater.

356
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,880
不管上映的是什么
It doesn't matter what's showing,

357
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,090
她就是...喜欢爆米花的味道
just... she likes the smell of the popcorn.

358
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,220
她还想养条狗
She wants a dog.

359
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,180
黑拉布拉多
A black lab.

360
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,540
加上一张超大号床
And a queen-size bed.

361
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,470
弄好多毛毯  可以钻进去  她要的不多
Lots of blankets to curl up in. She doesn't want much.

362
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,130
她只想消失
She just wants to be invisible.

363
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,680
看着我
Hey, look at me.

364
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,830
我叫凯茜·洛克哈特
My name is Cassie Lockhart.

365
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,170
脚伸过来
Give me your ankles.

366
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,410
手伸过来
Give me your hands.

367
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,590
过来
Come on.

368
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,460
站起来
Let's go.

369
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,140
喝的水
Some water.

370
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,500
那边二十英里有个镇子
There's a town 20 miles that way.

371
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,360
首先  我想祝贺安德伍德总统
First off, I'd like to congratulate President Underwood

372
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,500
今晚赢得了选举
for his victory here tonight.

373
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,900
竞争很激烈  他最终取胜了
It was a tight race and he came out on top.

374
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,260
不要  不要
No. No, no, no, no!

375
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,610
我们可不是输不起
Let's not be sore losers here.

376
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,020
因为我们根本没有输
Because the truth is, we haven't lost.

377
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:41,630
我们才刚上路呢
We are just getting started!

378
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,900
我要感谢过去几个月来
I want to thank all the staff and volunteers

379
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,610
辛勤工作的员工和志愿者
who worked so hard over the past several months.

380
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,860
我们该走了
We should get going.

381
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,730
我想再给克莱尔打次电话  看她肯不肯来
I want to try Claire one more time. See if she'll come out.

382
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,040
哪怕她马上动身  也要等三个小时
That's three hours from now, even if she left this minute.

383
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,450
人们可以等啊
But the crowd will wait.

384
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,380
黄金时段不好浪费
We don't want to squander primetime.

385
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,650
等到凌晨一点  就没人看演讲了
A speech at one in the morning, we lose major viewership.

386
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,820
我的孩子们  和我亲爱的丈夫...
My children and my dear husband...

387
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,280
好  走吧
Fine. Let's go.

388
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,380
她不在讲台上  你打算怎么讲
How do you want to handle the stage if she's not on it?

389
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,850
我不需要讲台
I won't need a stage.

390
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,060
感谢大家的到来
Thank you for coming out.

391
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,290
非常感谢  谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you.

392
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,530
非常感谢  谢谢  谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

393
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,640
爱荷华发声了
Well, Iowa has spoken.

394
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,320
他们的声音太响亮了
And they have spoken so loud,

395
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,110
我都不需要用麦克风了
that I don't even need a microphone.

396
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,200
我想在得梅因
Listen, I wanted to come down here

397
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,560
我们的竞选总部里
to our campaign headquarters in Des Moines,

398
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,760
不是像那个谁一样  在高档酒店宴会厅里
not go to some fancy hotel ballroom like you know who,

399
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,140
对你们所有终日努力工作的人说
and say to all of you who worked day in and day out,

400
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,290
在这场遍及爱荷华每个角落的选举中
on our behalf for this campaign, in every corner of this state...

401
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,710
我们今晚的成就全靠你们
It's because of you that we brought it home tonight!

402
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,870
你们肯定都想知道克莱尔在哪
Now, I know you're all wondering where Claire is.

403
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,350
有的人也许知道  她最近稍有抱恙
Some of you may know she's been a little under the weather.

404
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,380
她来自德州
She's from Texas.

405
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,420
还不太适应爱荷华的冬天
She doesn't understand these Iowa winters you have.

406
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,430
但她正在恢复  我今晚就飞回华盛顿
But she's on the mend and I'm flying to Washington tonight,

407
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,160
明天我就可以和她一起
so that tomorrow she and I can get on a plane

408
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,060
飞往新罕布什尔州  再拿下那里
and fly to New Hampshire, where we are gonna win there, too!

409
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,030
克莱尔
Claire.

410
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,120
他们说你在这儿
They told me you were down here.

411
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,050
我就想找个地方思考思考
I just wanted to come somewhere to think.

412
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,270
希望你好好想过了
Well, I hope you have.

413
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,370
也打消了你之前的疑虑
And that whatever was clouding your mind is gone.

414
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,770
因为我刚才一个人发表了获胜演说
Because I just had to give a victory speech... alone.

415
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,190
不管怎么样
And one way or another,

416
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:49,600
明天你一定要跟我一起上飞机
I need you on that plane with me tomorrow.

417
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,020
在桌子里
No. The desk.

418
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,130
左手边的抽屉
Left-hand drawer.

419
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,930
你还留着这个
You still have this.

420
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,470
是啊
Yes.

421
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,140
不知道为什么  觉得不该扔
It felt wrong to throw it out, for some reason.

422
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:31,590
我之前说到撒谎的事  我是想说...
When I said we were lying, what I meant was...

423
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,590
这么多年来  我以为我们在一起走这条路
For all these years, I thought we were on this path together.

424
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,980
但却跟我想的不一样
But it's not what I thought it would be.

425
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,120
不是我努力让自己相信的那样
What I convinced myself it would be,

426
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,160
像托马斯写的那样
like what Thomas wrote.

427
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,450
-我们是平等的  -我们是啊
- We're two equal parts. - We are.

428
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,720
你真的相信吗
You really believe that?

429
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,290
我们一起奋斗到今天
We earned this together.

430
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:58,310
我踏进办公室的第一天
I said that to your face

431
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,150
就当面对你说过
the first day I walked in here as president.

432
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,600
是你的办公室  不是我的
It's your office. Not mine.

433
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,570
我做的每个重大决定
I have not made a single major decision

434
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,440
都问过你
without asking your opinion first.

435
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,230
问题就在这儿  决定权都在你手里
But see, that's it. You make the decisions.

436
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,600
我想要的东西  比如联合国的事
Anything that I want, like the UN...

437
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,700
真让我恶心  弗兰西斯
It made me ill, Francis. My stomach turned.

438
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,210
为什么  因为你得辞职吗
Why, because you had to resign?

439
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,530
是因为我还得向你求助
No, because I had to ask for your help in the first place.

440
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,650
凭我自己没法拿下提名
That I couldn't get the confirmation on my own.

441
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,820
你有需要  找我帮忙怎么了
And what is wrong with asking for my help when you need it?

442
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,680
是我需要别人帮忙
The fact that I need it.

443
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,070
我厌恶那种感觉  那不像我
I hate that feeling. It's not me.

444
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,140
我照着镜子都已经不认识自己了
I don't recognize myself when I look in the mirror.

445
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:42,270
我会做像在爱荷华酒店里那样的事
I do things... like I did in the hotel in Iowa.

446
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,970
都没法跟你好好谈
I can't even talk with you about it.

447
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,820
你不说话  却想让我像畜生一样对你
Instead you want me to slap you around like some animal.

448
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,100
抛开一切  我们两个就是那样的关系
That's what we are when we strip everything away.

449
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,840
-那我能理解  -你简直是疯了
- That I can understand! - It was deranged,

450
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,810
要我那么上你
begging me to take you like that.

451
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:57,280
而你连这都不肯满足我
And you couldn't even give that to me.

452
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:02,210
你要是需要那样对你展现阳刚之气的丈夫
If you wanted a husband who proved his manhood to you that way,

453
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,310
还不如跟你妈待在达拉斯
you should've stayed back in Dallas with your mother

454
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,090
嫁个舞会国王
and married the prom king.

455
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,560
至少我还能知道自己的位置
At least I would've known where I stood.

456
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,090
你不能两者兼得
No, you can't have it both ways.

457
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,910
你高兴了就想要平等的关系吗
You want an equal partner when it suits you?

458
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,760
你想要男人掌控你就能要吗
You want a man to take charge when it suits you?

459
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,620
那我怎么办  猜你每次都想要什么吗
And I'm supposed to what, just divine when you want which?

460
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,240
别这么自私了  你比这强得多
Stop being so selfish. You're better than that.

461
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,270
-我没自私  -就是
- I'm not being selfish. - You are.

462
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,090
我们正在进行选举  看看咱俩
We're in the middle of an election, and look at us.

463
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,670
是啊  看看咱俩  弗兰西斯
That's exactly it. Look at us, Francis.

464
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,160
我们以前互相支持
We used to make each other stronger.

465
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,640
至少我以为是  可那也是假的
At least I thought so, but that was a lie.

466
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:36,920
我们是在支持你一个人
We were making you stronger.

467
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,600
我现在软弱又渺小
And now I'm just weak and small,

468
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,240
我受不了这种感觉了
and I can't stand that feeling any longer.

469
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,420
好吧  你想要什么
All right. What do you want?

470
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,080
你还有别的选择吗
What is the goddamn alternative?

471
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:51,160
求你了  克莱尔  我真的不懂
Please, Claire, tell me, because I don't understand.

472
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,640
我只听到你说不满足
All I am hearing is, it's not enough.

473
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,570
进驻白宫不满足
That the White House is not enough.

474
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,570
做第一夫人也不满足
That being First Lady is not enough.

475
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,160
-不满足  -不是
- Not enough! - No.

476
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,560
是你不满足
It's you that's not enough.

477
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,570
如果因为你...我们失败了
When we lose... because of you...

478
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,040
就什么都没有了
there will be nothing.

479
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,580
没有计划  没有未来
No plan. No future.

480
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,560
我们都会成为过去
We will only be has-beens.

481
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,260
你想成就点什么吗
And you want to amount to something?

482
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,720
那我告诉你残酷的事实
Well, here is the brutal fucking truth.

483
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,490
你可以恨我  可以觉得恶心
And you can hate me, you can be disgusted,

484
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,100
你有什么感觉都可以
you can feel whatever it is you wanna feel

485
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,200
因为我根本不在乎
because frankly, I'm beyond caring.

486
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,510
但是没了我  你什么都不是
But without me, you are nothing.

487
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:22,280
你说得对  这办公室只有一把椅子
You're right. This office has one chair.

488
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:27,310
你从一开始就知道这个
And you have always known that from the very beginning.

489
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,850
如果现在你接受不了这个
And if you now can't stomach that,

490
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,600
那我还真是个蠢货  当初居然娶了你
well, then I'm a fool for having married you in the first place.

491
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,920
但我没时间做蠢货
But I don't have time to be a fool.

492
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,130
我得治理国家  赢得选举
I have to run this country and win a nomination.

493
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,590
我在做我的工作
I'm doing my job.

494
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,430
道格也在做他的工作
Doug is out there doing his job.

495
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:55,140
你也该做你的工作了
And it's time now for you to do yours.

496
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,190
你要我掌控你吗  可以啊
You want me to take charge? Fine. I will take charge.

497
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,720
明天你给我上飞机
You will get on that plane tomorrow.

498
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,920
跟我去新罕布什尔州
You will come to New Hampshire.

499
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,040
给我微笑  跟人握手  亲小孩子
You will smile and shake hands and kiss babies.

500
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,020
在讲台上站在我旁边
And you will stand with me on a stage.

501
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,980
给我做你的第一夫人
And you will be the First Lady!

502
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,410
你要是都做到了
And you do all that.

503
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,840
私下里你可以随便恶心
I don't give a damn if you vomit on your own time.

504
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,870
计划20分钟后出发  先生
You're scheduled to depart in 20 minutes, sir.

505
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,540
谢谢  看第一夫人准备好没
Thank you. Check in with the First Lady, make sure she's ready.

506
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,530
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

507
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:07,970
怎么样
So?

508
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,220
你还好吗
Are you okay?

509
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,640
我准备好了  先生
I'm good to go, sir.

510
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,660
请进
Yes?

511
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,420
夫人  总统要我问您准备好没
Ma'am, the president wanted me to check and see if you're ready.

512
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,270
夫人
Ma'am?

513
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,750
弗兰西斯
Francis.

514
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,040
我不去新罕布什尔了
I'm not going to New Hampshire.

515
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,430
你要去  车里见
Yes, you are. I'll see you in the car.

516
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:55,570
我要离开你
I'm leaving you.

517
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,360
克莱尔
Claire.

519
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:30,550
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}由于美国总统初选各州投票时间不同
所以最先举行投票的爱荷华州  新罕布什尔  和南卡罗来纳三州
其选举结果对最终选举结果影响非常大
如果候选人在这三州的初选中失利
将被认为缺乏竞争力  在接下来其它州的选举中
无论是选民还是捐款的金主  都会迅速离TA而去
所以在总统选举的最初阶段
候选人几乎会把全部精力放在爱荷华州和新罕布什尔州的竞选上

521
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:55,550
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2008年  前第一夫人希拉里宣布参选
马上便被看作是民主党中最具实力的候选人
在爱荷华州初选投票前  无论是希拉里自己  还是媒体
都认为她应该能够顺利获得选举的胜利
然而由于过于轻敌  希拉里最终竟败给了一个不知名的政坛新秀  奥巴马
在爱荷华州的意外失手  彻底打乱了希拉里的选举部署
而奥巴马则凭借着爱荷华州初选的胜利在媒体上占尽风头
并乘胜追击  最后问鼎白宫
