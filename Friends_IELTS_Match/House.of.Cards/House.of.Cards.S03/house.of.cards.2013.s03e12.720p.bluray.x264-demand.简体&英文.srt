您需要个媒体专家替您掌舵

101

-你准备什么时候宣布  -很快
- When are you going to announce? - Soon.

102
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,270
但是我想先听你说同意
But I'd like you... to say yes first.

103
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,480
-同意什么  -接替我
- To what? - Replacing me.

104
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,580
我并不是病糊涂了
This isn't the disease speaking.

105
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,070
我并没有忘记你正在竞选总统
I haven't forgotten you're running for President.

106
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,520
但是安德伍德
But Underwood...

107
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,020
我肯定他会毫不犹豫地同意提名你
I'm sure he'd nominate you in a heartbeat.

108
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,170
我现在占上风  罗伯特  为什么要退出
I am the frontrunner, Robert. Why would I drop out?

109
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,630
因为这个职位是终身的
Because this position's for life.

110
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,170
安德伍德会输的
Underwood is going to lose.

111
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,740
你觉得他会轻易认输吗
You think he'll go down easily?

112
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,800
而且即使你拿到了提名  共和党...
And even if you get the nomination, the Republicans...

113
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,620
他们会生吞活剥了你
They'll... rip you apart.

114
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,520
我是决定性一票  我的位置很重要
I'm the swing vote. My seat is important.

115
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,850
你在这里可以产生长期的影响
You can make a lasting difference here.

116
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,520
他也是这么说的
That is exactly what he said.

117
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,420
他的动机不纯  是的
His motivations were atrocious, yes,

118
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,300
但他说的道理是对的
but his logic was sound.

119
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,140
看来你的头脑还像过去一样清醒  罗伯特
Your mind seems sharp as ever, Robert.

120
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,070
只是
Except...

121
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,550
只是我现在想不起来你叫什么
Except for the fact that I can't remember your name right now.

122
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,820
希瑟

124
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,240
你能继续我未竟的事业吗  希瑟
Will you continue to do the work I've done, Heather?

125
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,290
我不能
I can't.

126
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,290
摸着良心说  我太希望能成功了
If I'm honest with myself, it's that I want this too much.

127
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,760
开始竞选前我根本没有意识到
I didn't realize it before I started running.

128
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,610
并不是我变了  罗伯特
It is not that I've changed, Robert,

129
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,090
我并不是被野心蒙蔽了双眼
that ambition has clouded anything.

130
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,660
而是我之前都没有意识到我注定该做什么
It is that I was blind to this until now, what I am meant to be.

131
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,360
我注定要成为美国总统
And I am meant to be President of the United States.

132
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,240
你们是不是都想先听克莱尔讲话
Wouldn't you all like to hear from Claire first?

133
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,760
谢谢
Thank you!

134
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,740
弗兰西斯和我十分感激你们能冒着严寒
Francis and I so appreciate you all coming out here

135
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,100
到这里来如此热情地欢迎我们

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,190
回到爱荷华真是太好了

147
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,760
晚安
Good night.

148
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,420
晚安
Good night.

149
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,650
请帮我接通汤姆·耶茨的电话
Yes, connect me with Tom Yates, please.

150
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,230
不  我等着
No, I'll hold.

151
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,640
总统先生
Mr. President?

152
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,290
剩下的部分呢
Where's the rest of it?

153
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,470
-你读了吗  -还没有
- Have you read it? - No, not yet.

154
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,210
我只拿到了第一章
Just this first chapter arrived.

155
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,530
请你先读一下  先生  然后我们再谈
Will you please read it first, sir? And then let's talk.

156
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,160
你病了吗  你的声音有点哑
Are you sick? You sound hoarse.

157
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,350
没有  我没生病
Well, no, I'm not sick.

158
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
只是缺觉而已
I haven't slept much.

159
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,730
好吧  我明天再给你打电话
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.

160
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,940
先生
Sir?

161
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,810
不好意思  先生
Excuse me. Sir?

162
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,820
我忘了我进来干什么了
I forgot why I came in here.

163
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,440
那瓶橙汁
The orange juice.

164
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,780
2美元25美分
That'll be two twenty-five.

165
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,410
好的
Yeah.

166
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,050
"国庆节已经变得毫无意义
"The Fourth of July means nothing anymore.

167
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,780
烤焦的热狗
Overcooked hot dogs

168
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,870
永远令你失望的焰火
and fireworks that always leave you disappointed.

169
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,560
中国制造的小号美国国旗
Bite-size American flags made in China,

170
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,710
在一心只想去打游戏的五岁顽童
halfheartedly waved by five-year-olds

171
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,740
手中有一搭没一搭地挥舞着
who'd rather be playing Minecraft.

172
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,020
但9月3日  却是真正重要的一天
But the third of September, that's a date which matters.

173
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,480
三十年前的这一天
It's the day, three decades past,

174
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,250
一个加夫尼的农民娶到了一位达拉斯的名媛
that a redneck from Gaffney married a debutante from Dallas.

175
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,090
世界旋转的角度在那天改变了
And the Earth's axis tilted that day,

176
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,980
尽管当时他们  以及我们都并不知道
though neither they, nor we, knew it at the time.

177
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,570
一个是将自己的婚誓比作
Here's a woman who describes her vows

178
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,880
在桥边为自杀而犹豫徘徊的女人
as a suicide flirting with a bridge's edge.

179
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,150
一个是将婚戒当作羞耻徽章的男人
And a man who wears his wedding ring as a badge of shame,

180
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,590
因为他觉得配不上这位名媛
for the debutante deserved more.

181
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,130
但是说真的  有夫如此  妇复何求
But truly, what more could she desire?

182
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,090
他们携手统治了一个没有子嗣的帝国
Together, they rule an empire without heirs.

183
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,130
遗志是他们唯一的孩子"
Legacy is their only child."

184
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,130
进来
Come in.

185
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,310
他也寄了一份给你
He sent you a copy, too?

186
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,620
我以为这书是关于你的  而不是我们
I thought this was supposed to be about you, not us.

187
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,840
这一切就是个错误
The whole thing was a mistake.

188
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,860
我们暴露太多了  弗兰西斯
We revealed too much, Francis.

189
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,430
我不该把你置于那种境地
I should've never put you in that position.

190
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,850
我会让这事到此为止
I'll put an end to it.

191
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,830
你觉得他说得对吗
Do you think he was right?

192
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,330
关于什么
About what?

193
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,610
"两个通用元素冷聚变
"A cold fusion of two universal elements,

194
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,760
重量一致  力量均等
identical in weight, equal in force.

195
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,380
他们站在一起  独一无二的联盟
United they stand. A union like none other.

196
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,000
成为美国政坛不可分裂的原子"
The unsplittable atom of American politics."

197
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,030
他总算说对一点
Well, he was right about some things.

198
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,290
我应该跟他面谈  减轻对他的打击
I should go speak to him face to face, soften the blow.

199
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,350
她昨天在奥维恩有活动
She did an event in Oelwein yesterday

200
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,170
我们的人说
and our people say you

201
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,540
欢呼声太大  几乎听不见她说话
could barely hear her with all the cheering.

202
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,850
她会对我们造成多大伤害
How badly can she hurt us?

203
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,120
他们只需要多一两个百分点  而且还没算上误差
They only need a point or two and he's in the margin of error.

204
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,580
所以我们得攻击她
So we need to attack her.

205
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,050
联合国的事没有攻击力  我们得想点新的
The UN stuff slid right off. We need something new.

206
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,560
跟杰姬谈谈
Let's talk to Jackie.

207
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,800
谢谢你能来  旅行顺利吗
Thank you for coming. How was your trip?

208
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,610
我还不错  但我妈受了点苦
Good for me. A little rough for my mom, though.

209
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,730
她不习惯连续两天看到我
She's not used to seeing me more than two days in a row.

210
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,600
她都没问题问我了
She actually ran out of questions.

211
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,820
我好嫉妒  坐吧  我一直忙个不停
I'm jealous. Have a seat. It's been nonstop here for me.

212
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,720
这边要轮轴转
Full-time job here.

213
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,150
还要代表希瑟去加州
Doing surrogate appearances for Heather in California.

214
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
我们真的很需要你  雷米
We could really use you, Remy.

215
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,470
这是招聘会面吗
A recruiting session?

216
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,080
你也该想到了吧
You can't be surprised.

217
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,350
我还希望你只是想看看我
I was hoping you just wanted to see my face.

218
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,410
我们无法向你提供格兰顿-希尔那样的薪酬
We can't offer you as much as you made at Glendon Hill,

219
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,240
但我们能比白宫给的多得多
but we can offer you a lot more than you made at the White House.

220
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,140
我没兴趣
I'm not interested.

221
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,910
回答得太快了吧  即便是对你来说
That was fast. Even for you.

222
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,500
-你去哪了  -没去哪
- Where'd you land? - Nowhere.

223
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,560
我退出了  杰姬  不再参与政治
I'm out, Jackie. No more politics.

224
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,400
你不是说真的  你就是干政治的
You know you don't mean that. It's who you are.

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,550
我以前很长一段时间也这么认为
That's what I thought, too, for a long time.

226
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,090
我都不知道还要不要待在华府
I don't even know if I'll stay in DC.

227
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,930
那你怎么打算
What are you gonna do?

228
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,910
这就是最棒的地方  我完全不知道
That's the best part. I have no idea.

229
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,650
你就别费劲说服我了
I'll save you the trouble of trying to convince me.

230
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,470
克莱尔·安德伍德
Claire Underwood.

231
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,320
我们必须狠狠打击她
We need to hit her hard.

232
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,520
你想要把柄  我没有
You want dirt. I don't have any.

233
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,980
你肯定有
You must.

234
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,790
如果我真有  我不知道我会不会给你
If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.

235
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,760
但我没有  他们从不让我进核心圈子
But I don't. They never let me in the inner circle.

236
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,190
她逼问过他  但毫无结果
She pressed him, but nothing.

237
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,320
我们竟然找不到
I find it hard to believe

238
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,430
一点把柄  真是难以置信
that we don't have a single thing we can use.

239
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,330
对手研究团队已经翻遍过去25年的
Our OPPO team has looked at every article,

240
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,850
每篇文章  每卷录像带
every piece of footage going back 25 years.

241
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,820
调查过所有熟人  家人  全套
Researched acquaintances, family, the works.

242
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,360
如果真的有  我们早找到了
If it's out there, we would've found it.

243
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,670
等等  还有一件事
Wait. There is one thing.

244
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,770
什么
What?

245
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,550
喂
Hello?

246
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,450
道格  好久没联系了
Doug. It's been a while.

247
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,630
-你想要什么  -那份日记
- What do you want? - The journal.

248
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,110
你要什么价
What would it take?

249
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,400
你说你永远不会那样对一个女人
You said you would never do that to another woman.

250
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,970
-要多少钱  -你要给我钱吗
- How much? - You're offering money?

251
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,430
如果这是你想要的
If that's what you want.

252
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,460
要我背叛别人可不便宜
Betrayal doesn't come cheap.

253
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,200
说个数字吧
Name a figure.

254
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,030
你喜欢看什么书
What do you like to read?

255
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,080
平时看书吗
Do you read?

256
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,440
我看的
Yes, I read.

257
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,620
谢谢  密查姆
Oh, thank you, Meechum.

258
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,580
-你不喜欢  -我没那么说
- You hate it. - I didn't say that.

259
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,590
你不会专程从爱荷华飞回来夸我
You wouldn't fly back from Iowa just to say, "Good job."

260
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,810
你刚给我21页
Well, look, you've only turned in 21 pages,

261
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,730
而那书本来现在就该完成了
and the book was supposed to be finished by now.

262
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,190
我花了这么久才想清楚究竟该写什么
It took me this long to figure out what the book is really about.

263
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,060
它应该写的  是你们俩
And what it's about, is the two of you.

264
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,870
我们得重新开始
We have to start over.

265
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,030
重新开始
Start over?

266
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,240
书应该是写《美国就业法案》的
The book was supposed to be about America Works.

267
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,860
你跟我说想尝试不同的角度
Now, you said you wanted to try a different approach.

268
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,650
我有怀疑  但支持了你  如今
I was skeptical, but then I went along with it and now,

269
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,370
你给了我一本书的开篇...
you've handed over to me the beginning of a book...

270
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,250
还是写我的婚姻的
about my marriage?

271
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,640
你想要我写得快  还是写得好
Well, do you want it fast, or do you want it right?

272
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,090
我跟你说过我从没在一年内写完一本书
I told you I've never written anything in less than a year.

273
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,170
对  再过一个月
Yeah, and in a month's time,

274
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,030
你又会说有了新想法
you're gonna say you've come up with some new idea.

275
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,140
不  就是这个了  你和克莱尔
No, this is it. You and Claire.

276
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,700
你们的婚姻
The marriage.

277
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,550
那是开启其他一切的关键
That's the key that unlocks everything else.

278
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,150
如果我想要曝光我的私人生活
If I had wanted an exposé about my personal life,

279
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,710
就从《美国周刊》雇个撰稿人来了
I would've hired a staff writer from Us Weekly.

280
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,480
等等  这不是小报的垃圾
Well... hold on a minute. This is not tabloid bullshit.

281
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,980
在这屋里  你说  你想要独特的声音
You said, in this room, you wanted an original voice.

282
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,660
我就在给你那个
I am giving it to you.

283
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,750
你不是思维狭隘的人  总统先生
You're not narrow-minded, Mr. President.

284
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,640
我知道你能理解我在做的事
I know you can appreciate what I'm trying to do.

285
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,710
是的  但你看  这就是问题
Right, but see, that's the problem right there.

286
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,770
这重点是你想做的事
This is about what you're trying to do.

287
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,790
是你的需求和...你怎么说的来着
What your needs and... what did you call it?

288
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,510
-你的瘾  -不是那样的
- Your addiction. - That's not true.

289
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,930
不  就是这样  我雇你来完成任务
No, it is true. I hired you to do a job,

290
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,590
就是帮我拉到选票
which was to get me votes.

291
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,690
早就该做到了  而不是六个月后
Yesterday, not six months from now.

292
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,290
这不是什么大事  这事没成功
Now, look, it's no big deal. It didn't work out.

293
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,100
但我保证  会付你全款
But I promise you, you will be paid in full.

294
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,150
谢谢你  汤姆
Thank you, Tom.

295
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,940
这书应该写完  应该被人读到
This deserves to be finished, and it deserves to be read.

296
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,220
我恰好不同意
Well, I just happen to disagree with you.

297
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,910
你害怕我写的东西吗
Are you afraid of what I wrote?

298
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,040
害怕  不
Afraid? No.

299
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,870
这只是不关其他人的事
It's just no one's business.

300
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,380
你不能埋没它
Well, you can't bury it.

301
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,450
我不会允许
I won't allow that.

302
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,460
你正在跟凯特·鲍德温拍拖
You're in an intimate relationship with Kate Baldwin,

303
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,360
对吗
isn't that correct?

304
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,550
我从没提过这事  因为我相信
I've never said anything because I presume that you can

305
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,180
你可以把个人生活跟我们的专业协议分开
separate your personal life from our professional arrangement.

306
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,560
但在你考虑一些轻率的主意前
But before you start getting any reckless ideas,

307
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,870
不如先记住一件事  这本书是我的
why don't you just remember one thing: I own this material.

308
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,350
如果你想跟任何人分享它
And if you attempt to share it with anybody,

309
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,650
哪怕是一个字
and I mean one single word,

310
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,640
诉讼算是最轻的麻烦了
litigation will be the least of your worries.

311
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,970
毕竟  我想我们都不愿意
I mean, after all, I don't think either of us

312
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,130
看到你第一本书的作者问题出现争议
wants any controversy about the authorship of your first book.

313
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,750
对吧
Do we?

314
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,540
密查姆  送耶茨先生出去好吗
Meechum, will you please escort Mr. Yates out?

315
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,790
祝你好运  汤姆
And good luck to you, Tom.

316
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,690
书的事真遗憾
Too bad about the book.

317
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,350
你不是真那么想
You don't really mean that.

318
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
没错
No, I don't.

319
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,450
格雷森先生来电  先生
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.

320
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,890
你说什么
What was that?

321
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,980
格雷森先生来电  先生  他说是急事
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir. He says it's urgent.

322
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,970
他在1号线上  先生
He's on line one, sir.

323
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,350
赛斯
Seth?

324
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,370
好的  我最好待在华盛顿
All right. I better stay in Washington.

325
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,580
告诉沃恩
Let Vaughn know.

326
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,980
给我接克莱尔
Get me Claire.

327
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,800
你觉得宣布时机是算计好的
You think the timing is strategic?

328
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,460
他和邓巴关系很好
Well, he and Dunbar are close.

329
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,540
你对提名谁有想法吗
Do you have any idea who you're going to nominate?

330
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,090
我们明早会过一遍总名单
We'll go through our master list in the morning,

331
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,750
但这会让我无法按计划做宣传
but this'll take me off the campaign trail.

332
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,760
我一两天内还不能去爱荷华  你能替我吗
I won't be in Iowa for a day or two. You're okay to cover me?

333
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,790
当然可以  我会继续挥舞捧花
Yes, of course. I'll keep waving my pom-poms.

334
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,670
你能单独宣传真是个圣人
Well, you're a saint to do it without me,

335
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,830
但也许这样更好
but it's probably best.

336
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,560
他们更喜欢你
They like you even better.

337
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,080
你跟汤姆谈过了吗
Did you speak with Tom?

338
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,880
谈了  他不太乐意  但我说得很明确
I did. He didn't take it well, but I made it very clear.

339
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,180
我又看了一遍那一章
I read it again. The chapter.

340
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,150
别管了  我们摆脱他了
Let it go. We're done with him.

341
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,390
克莱尔
Claire?

342
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,090
抱歉  上场活动持续了很久
Sorry. Uh, the last event went quite long.

343
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,080
我累坏了
I'm fading.

344
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,100
你休息吧  明天再说
Well, you get some sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.

345
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,640
好  晚安  弗兰西斯
Okay. Good night, Francis.

346
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,660
晚安
Good night.

347
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,080
真是惊喜
This is a nice surprise.

348
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,440
时机不对吗
Now a bad time?

349
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,710
不会  你怎么进来的
Not at all. How did you get in the building?

350
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,850
没人通知我
Nobody called me.

351
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,230
接待员最喜欢的书是《天蝎》
The receptionist. Scorpio is her favorite book.

352
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,520
当然啦
Of course, it is.

353
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,800
在忙什么呢
What are you working on?

354
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,710
约旦河谷的机密行动
Covert operation in the Jordan Valley.

355
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,500
你老板安德伍德既不承认也不否认
Your boy Underwood has refused to confirm or deny,

356
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,770
但你看看这个
but take a look at that.

357
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,280
这是写给贾斯汀·尼克斯家人的信
That's a letter to the family of Justin Nix.

358
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,490
机密行动当天死亡的海豹突击队队员
Navy SEAL who died the same day as the covert operation.

359
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,460
总统签了字
Signed by the president.

360
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,570
上面写他在演练中丧生
Says it was a training exercise.

361
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,810
我刚跟国防部的线人通了电话
I just got off the phone with a source in the DOD

362
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,620
他们说当天没有海豹突击队演练
and they said there were no SEAL training exercises that day.

363
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,860
而10月18日
His death is the only

364
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,170
只报告了他一人阵亡
military KIA reported on October eighteenth.

365
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,990
我是不是打破你对他的美好幻想了
Am I shattering your illusions about the guy?

366
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,150
他炒了我
He fired me.

367
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,300
什么  为什么
What? Why?

368
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,710
我不想给你发邮件
I didn't want to e-mail it to you.

369
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,200
你的书
This is it?

370
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,670
第一章
The first chapter.

371
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,910
雅各布斯法官尽职尽责地服务了国家
Justice Jacobs served our nation with duty and distinction.

372
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,120
当法院意见不一致时
And when the Court was strongly divided,

373
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,760
在他任职的23年里  他数次
as it was many times during his 23 years on the bench,

374
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,380
凭自己的关键票
it was his swing vote

375
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,710
创造了流传后世的法律判例
that created legal precedents that will last for centuries.

376
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,410
虽然替任者很难找  但我一定会找到
Now, it will not be an easy seat to fill, but fill it I must.

377
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,170
先生
Sir.

378
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,010
邓巴的人刚联系我
Dunbar's people just reached out to me.

379
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,360
她回华盛顿了  想见你
She's back in Washington and she wants to meet with you.

380
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,660
干什么
What for?

381
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,380
她想谈法官提名的事
She wants to talk about the nomination.

382
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,510
她想推荐人
She wants to propose someone.

383
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,920
没错  她自己
Yes. Herself.

384
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,250
找个时间  找个隐秘的地方
Find a time. And find somewhere discreet.

385
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,240
别让任何在职人员看到她
I don't want anyone on staff seeing her.

386
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,540
早上好  我是克莱尔·安德伍德
Good morning. I'm Claire Underwood.

387
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,120
我刚给她换了尿布
Uh, I just changed her diaper.

388
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,090
还没来得及洗手
I haven't had a chance to wash my hands.

389
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,070
她叫什么  她好漂亮
What is her name? She's beautiful.

390
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,800
-凯拉  -凯拉  你叫什么
- Kayla. - Kayla. And what's your name?

391
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,780
-苏茜  -你好  苏茜
- Suzie. - Hi, Suzie.

392
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,460
我只想感谢你的支持
Well, I just wanted to thank you so much for your support.

393
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,370
对我丈夫和我意义重大
It means so much to my husband and me.

394
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,730
我不支持他
I don't support him.

395
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,230
我看到了外面的标志
I saw the signs out front.

396
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,830
那是我丈夫的  我支持希瑟·邓巴
Those are my husband's. I support Heather Dunbar.

397
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,560
我们来踩点时  她丈夫在
When we vetted the house, the husband was here.

398
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,080
你会考虑改变想法吗
Um, would you ever consider changing your mind?

399
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,540
抱歉  安德伍德夫人
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood,

400
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,040
我不想上电视或报纸
I don't really want to be on TV or in the papers.

401
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,310
抱歉
My apologies about that.

402
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,260
介意我进去坐坐吗
Would you mind if I just came inside?

403
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,820
不拍照  只有我
No cameras, just me?

404
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,790
应该可以吧
I guess so.

405
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,980
我们得先排查这间房子  夫人
We need to do a sweep of the house first, ma'am.

406
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,630
不用  他们留在外面
No. And they stay out here.

407
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,960
你好  希瑟
Hello, Heather.

408
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,980
罗伯特怎么样
How's Robert?

409
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,730
他很难过
He's sad.

410
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,090
但他至少能体面地退出
But at least he's making his exit with grace.

411
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,920
你在新闻发布会上
Those were some very nice things

412
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,210
说他的话很不错
you said about him during your press conference.

413
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,530
你之前怎么跟我说的
Well, what was it you said to me...

414
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,420
要把什么说成好听的
about, uh, making things palatable?

415
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,910
-不堪的目的  -没错  不堪
- The obscene. - Ah, yes. The obscene.

416
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,690
的确是不堪  他这么好的头脑不再灵活
Well, it is obscene, a mind like his losing its sharpness.

417
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,600
我不指望去总统办公室  但这...有意思
I didn't expect the Oval, but this is interesting.

418
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,930
这是我和佩特罗夫在峰会时抽雪茄的地方
This is where Petrov and I smoked cigars during the summit.

419
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,370
这是他在墙上戳灭烟头的地方
That's where he put his out on the wall.

420
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,260
赛斯跟我说你想要法官提名
So, Seth tells me you want the nomination.

421
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,220
不  我是为了进门才那么说
No. I just said that to get in the door.

422
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,310
罗伯特认为如果这意味着我退出竞选
Robert thought you'd say yes in a heartbeat

423
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,400
你会立刻答应
if it meant me dropping out of the race.

424
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,530
但是退不退出
But the decision you have to make

425
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,620
是你要做的决定
is whether you'll drop out or not.

426
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,060
我为什么要那么做呢
And why would I do that?

427
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,610
我知道克莱尔在流产一事上撒了谎
I know Claire lied about the abortion,

428
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,740
我也有日记作为证据
and I have the journal to prove it.

429
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,660
我是在给你体面退出的机会
I'm giving you an opportunity to bow out gracefully,

430
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,790
就像罗伯特那样
just like Robert.

431
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,150
但是你要在党团会议之前退出
But you have to do it before the caucus.

432
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,090
我给你三天时间
I'll give you three days.

433
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,340
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

434
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,680
就是你让道格销毁的那本
The one you asked Doug to destroy.

435
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,740
他或许没有照做
I wouldn't be so certain that he did it.

436
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,560
那么...
So...

437
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,370
你终于也变成我们这种人了
you're finally one of us.

438
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,910
什么人
One of who?

439
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,420
待在烟雾缭绕的密室里的男人
The men. In their smoky back rooms.

440
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,540
如果日记真的存在
And even if there was a journal...

441
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,710
你也没这个种
you don't have it in you.

442
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,370
随便你怎么想
Make whatever assumption you want.

443
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,160
罗伯特是对的  我会把提名给你
Well, Robert was right. I would offer you the nomination.

444
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,880
你应该采纳睿智之人的建议
You should take the advice of a smart man.

445
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,350
三天  总统先生
Three days, Mr. President.

446
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,860
想想克莱尔
Think about Claire.

447
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,410
请送我出去
Show me out, please.

448
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,910
她怎么冲我来都可以
She can go after me all she wants,

449
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,930
可她敢找克莱尔的麻烦
but she goes after Claire,

450
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,420
我就在光天化日之下割了她喉咙
I'll slit her fucking throat in broad daylight.

451
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,540
他赦免了沃克  还有那个有钱人
Like when he pardoned Walker, and that other guy, the rich one.

452
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,760
-雷蒙德·塔斯克  -对  就是他
- Raymond Tusk. - Yeah, him.

453
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,340
他们是坏人  结果却被他放走了
I mean, those were bad people, and he let them off the hook.

454
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,340
还有  他说不参选  结果还是参选了
And then he says he's not running and he does.

455
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,190
这个嘛  比你说的
Well, it's a little more complicated

456
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,440
要更复杂一些
than the way you're putting it.

457
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,380
有很多因素
There's a lot of variables

458
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,840
导致他做出那样的决策
that go into making decisions like that, and...

459
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,630
那时我就在他身边  我知道他多痛苦
I can tell you I was right beside him and he was agonizing.

460
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,560
抱歉  她饿了
I'm sorry. She's hungry.

461
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,100
我还在给我女儿喂奶
I still breastfeed my girl.

462
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,010
-请回避一下  -夫人
- Go outside, please. - Ma'am?

463
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,750
出去一下就好
Just go outside.

464
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
你要是希望的话  我也可以回避
I can go out too, if you like.

465
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,380
不必了
No, it's okay.

466
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,330
只要你不介意看到我的胸
As long as you don't mind seeing some boob.

467
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,930
她有兄弟姐妹吗
Does she have any brothers or sisters?

468
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,720
没有  她是独生女
No, this is the only one.

469
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,070
詹姆斯和我努力了好一阵儿
James and I have been trying for a while.

470
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,290
我一直怀不上
Had some trouble getting pregnant.

471
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,190
-詹姆斯是你丈夫  -是  他叫吉姆
- James is your husband? - Yeah. He goes by Jim.

472
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,890
但我更喜欢叫他詹姆斯
But I like James better.

473
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,130
他肯定是信任我丈夫的  毕竟他支持他
Well, he must trust my husband. He's supporting him.

474
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,460
詹姆斯都不知道那个词什么意思
James doesn't know what that word means.

475
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,570
-信任吗  -对  整个镇子都知道
- Trust? - Yeah. The whole town knows it.

476
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,940
只要是女人他都追
He runs after anything in a skirt.

477
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,930
说实在话  我不怎么介意
Which I don't mind so much, to be honest.

478
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,280
我自己也放纵过几回
I mean, I've had a fling or two myself.

479
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,260
我不喜欢他为此撒谎
What I don't like is how he lies about it.

480
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,510
然后  当他问我有没有另找过
And then, when he asks me if I've been with someone

481
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,730
而我说有的时候  他就气得发疯
and I say yes, he flips out.

482
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,270
就好像存在双重标准似的
Like there's some kind of double standard.

483
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,990
他想在克里斯蒂·莫利根
I mean, he wants to dog Christy Mulligan

484
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,740
新车的后座上跟她后入式
in the back of her brand new Escalade?

485
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,930
行啊  那为什么我就不能为凯拉的婴儿床
Fine. Why shouldn't I be able to give Kyle Beckenbauer some head

486
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,230
给凯尔·贝肯鲍尔吹箫致谢呢
for building Kayla's crib?

487
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,440
不好意思
I'm sorry.

488
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,890
这就是三个月不睡的结果
This is what happens when you don't sleep for three months.

489
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,910
你们两口子打架吗  你和你丈夫
You two fight? You and your husband?

490
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,100
每对已婚夫妇都吵架的
Every married couple fights.

491
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,010
我是指真正的打架  能把警察招来那种
I mean, really fight. Like, the cops get called.

492
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,220
或者说  他要不是总统  警察就会来那种
Or they would, if he wasn't the president.

493
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,830
因为
'Cause I mean,

494
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,730
治安官如今几乎是我们家一员了
the sheriff is practically a family member at this point.

495
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,980
现在我们又为这该死的选举打架
Now we're fighting about the damn election.

496
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,570
比如院子里那些破标语
Like those stupid yard signs.

497
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,620
有时候我真希望能收拾东西离开他
Sometimes, I wish I could just pull up stakes and leave him.

498
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,190
但是我做不到  为什么呢
But I can't. Why not?

499
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,590
因为这个小家伙
Because of this little one.

500
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,500
我们最后一次做试管婴儿时  我对自己说
Last in vitro we did, I said to myself,

501
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,900
如果这次还不行  我就走人
if this one doesn't work, I'm outta here.

502
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,090
我们为了要孩子把房子二次抵押了
We had to double mortgage the house to pay for it.

503
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,040
但好使了  于是就这样了
But it worked. And... here I am.

504
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,080
如果我像你  没孩子
If I was like you... didn't have a kid...

505
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,970
能告诉你个秘密吗
Can I tell you a secret?

506
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,810
没有哪个母亲会承认  但有时候我幻想
No mother will admit this, but sometimes I fantasize,

507
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,360
用这块枕头...
like, like this pillow here...

508
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,520
趁凯拉在摇篮里的时候
I mean, and when Kayla was in her crib.

509
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,370
就两分钟就行  我就能离开了
Two minutes. That's all it would take, and I could go.

510
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,010
我不用留在一个我想离开的男人身边
And I wouldn't be stuck to a man I want to leave,

511
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,660
往乳头上抹乳液  好让它软
rubbing lotion on my nipples, they're so raw.

512
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
我可以重新开始
I could start over.

513
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,540
当然  我不是真那么想  我绝不会那么做
Of course, I don't mean it. I mean, I'd never to do that.

514
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,270
但...人会胡思乱想
But... you have thoughts.

515
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,850
苏茜
You know what, Suzie,

516
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,770
我觉得我占用你太多时间了
I think I've taken up too much of your time.

517
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,730
你知道我不是真那么想吧
You know I'm not serious, right?

518
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,540
当然
Of course.

519
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,360
抱歉  我就是...
I'm sorry. I'm just...

520
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,250
好累啊
I'm so tired.

521
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,610
你真是个好倾听者
You're a really good listener.

522
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,650
真希望你能去竞选总统
I wish you were running for president.

523
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,560
如果你想可以告诉他们我支持你丈夫
Hey, you can tell them I'm for your husband if you want.

524
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,010
我大概都不会参加党团会议
I probably won't even caucus.

525
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,240
祝你好运  苏茜
Good luck to you, Suzie.

526
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,070
安德伍德夫人  她改主意了吗
Mrs. Underwood, did she change her mind?

527
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,900
没有  她坚持己见
No, she stuck to her guns.

528
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,140
但你不能怪一个女人坚持信念
But you can't blame a woman for having conviction.

529
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,370
总统刚刚打来找您
The president just called for you.

530
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,700
我上车后给他打回去
I'll call him back from the car.

531
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,080
听我说  我要告诉你件事  你别慌
Listen to me. What I'm about to say, I don't want you to panic.

532
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,740
怎么了
What is it?

533
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,710
日记  邓巴说在她手里
The journal. Dunbar claims she has it.

534
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,160
-怎么会  -我不知道
- But how? - I don't know.

535
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,930
看来可能是道格
It looks like it might have been Doug.

536
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,470
-他不是...  -我知道  我也难以置信
- He was supposed to-- - I know. It's hard for me to believe.

537
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,180
不  弗兰西斯  这绝不行
No, Francis. This can't happen.

538
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,090
密查姆正在找他
Meechum is tracking him down now.

539
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,790
亲爱的  听我说
Sweetheart, listen to me.

540
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,310
不  这件事...这件事
No, the whole thing, it-- The whole thing--

541
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,700
她只是威胁了我
All she did was make the threat.

542
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,230
她未必真会那么做
That doesn't mean she actually has it.

543
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,520
不论如何  解决这事  弗兰西斯
Whatever you have to do. Just fix it, Francis.

544
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,910
我会的  我保证
I will, I promise you that.

545
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,010
但是现在  你得回来
But in the meantime, you have to come back here.

546
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,540
你得上飞机  你得回来
I need you to get to the plane. You have to come back.

547
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,710
如果我们被奇袭了  我不希望你还在外面
I don't want you there, out on the road, if we get blindsided.

548
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,920
克莱尔  克莱尔
Claire? Claire.

549
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,070
我这就回去
I'll come home.

550
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,320
马上登机  就说你不舒服
You go straight to the plane. We'll say you weren't feeling well.

551
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,740
好
Okay.

552
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,480
上帝  让我平静接受我无法改变的事
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

553
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,320
让我勇敢改变我可以改变的事
the courage to change the things I can,

554
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,830
并拥有分辨二者的智慧
and the wisdom to know the difference.

555
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,510
坚持来  如果有帮助  就继续努力
Keep coming back. It works if you work it.

556
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,470
怎么样
So?

557
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,490
你还真以为他会喜欢这个吗
You honestly believed he'd go for this?

558
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,580
是啊
Yeah.

559
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,320
内容很好  而且很坦诚
The writing is good. And it's honest.

560
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,430
但哪个神经正常的候选人
But what candidate in their right mind

561
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,830
会希望这样的东西发表啊
would want something like this out there?

562
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,880
我要你报导出去  他想扼杀这本书
I need you to write about it. That he's trying to suppress this.

563
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,430
-你需要的是睡眠  -帮帮我吧  凯特
- What you need is sleep. - Do this for me, Kate.

564
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,880
-不行  这有利益冲突  -得了
- I can't. It's a conflict of interest. - Come on.

565
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,380
我们一上床  就越界了
The moment we slept together, we crossed the line.

566
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,200
去他的界线
Fuck the line!

567
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,570
我不能因为你的书没戏就赌上我的名誉
I'm not risking my reputation because your book is dead.

568
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,960
不  还有戏呢
Oh, no. Not dead.

569
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,810
我会写完的
I'm gonna finish it.

570
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,710
如果有必要  我会改掉名字  当成小说
I'll change the names if I have to, call it fiction.

571
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,960
他是美国总统
He's the President of the United States.

572
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
-那又如何  -他能毁掉别人
- So what? - He crushes people.

573
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,470
放手吧  重新开始
Let this go. Just start something new.

574
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,170
"重新开始"
"Start something new."

575
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,970
天呐  你根本不懂
Jesus... Christ, you don't get it.

576
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,430
我经常这样
I do it all the time.

577
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,600
我的编辑毙掉一篇报导  我继续做下一篇
My editor passes on a story, I move on to the next one.

578
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,950
我现在对你太他妈失望了
I'm so fucking disappointed in you right now.

579
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,560
我吗
Me?

580
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,670
我是想把你从幻想中拯救出来
I'm the one trying to save you from your own delusions.

581
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,330
他就是这么说的
That's exactly what he said.

582
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,570
也许他说得对
Maybe he's right.

583
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,440
我都快对你有感情了
I almost felt something for you.

584
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,610
进来吧
Come in.

585
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,340
外套给我吧
Let me take your coat.

586
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,160
要给你拿点什么吗  拿点喝的
Can I get you anything? Something to drink?

587
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,180
不不  不用  谢谢
No. No, I'm good. Thanks.

588
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,380
多谢你来我家  但我不会改变主意的
I appreciate the home visit, but I'm not gonna change my mind.

589
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,460
不不  我没觉得你会改主意
No, no. I didn't think you would.

590
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,880
出什么事了吗
Something wrong?

591
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,850
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

592
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,630
我以为
I figured...

593
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,610
我邀你加入竞选时
when I asked you to join the campaign,

594
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,170
我以为你会答应
I just assumed you would say yes.

595
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,320
我们就可以一起工作
That the two of us, we would be working together.

596
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,210
而且
And...

597
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,870
我...我
I... I...

598
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,360
我无法停止想你
I can't stop thinking about you.

599
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,960
你结婚了  杰姬
You're married, Jackie.

600
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,370
因为错误的原因
For the wrong reasons.

601
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,110
我以为你们彼此相爱
I thought you loved each other.

602
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,770
不是这种爱
Not like this.

603
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,150
我没做我想做的人
I'm not the person I want to be.

604
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,720
你做了你应该做的  看看你的成就
You're who you need to be. Look at what you've achieved.

605
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,920
但你做到了  你彻底放弃了
But you did it. You gave it all up.

606
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,290
毫不犹豫
In a heartbeat.

607
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,270
我们是不同的人
We're different people.

608
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,060
你该走了
You should go.

609
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,680
把这些抛在脑后
Put this behind you.

610
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,440
看来以为我们依能保持亲密是我天真了
I guess it was naive to think that we could remain close.

611
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,660
到此为止了吗
So this is it?

612
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,760
是的  到此为止了
Yeah. It is.

613
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,930
杰姬
Jackie?

614
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,950
杰姬
Jackie...

615
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,120
她说在她那儿
She says she has it.

616
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
她撒谎
She doesn't.

617
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,330
我怎么知道没有其它副本
How do I know there aren't other copies?

618
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,810
你的烟放在哪
Where do you keep your cigarettes?

619
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,520
在那上面的碗里
In the bowl up there.

620
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,990
我当初让你销毁时  你为什么不销毁
Why didn't you destroy it when I first asked you to?

621
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,950
不知道
I don't know.

622
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,700
有什么阻止了我  也许有一天我会用到
Something stopped me. Maybe I would need it one day.

623
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,700
为了你  证明我的忠诚
For you. To prove my loyalty.

624
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,650
你告诉她了  我可没法称之为忠诚
You told her. I'd hardly call that loyalty.

625
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,930
我得向她表明我是认真的
I had to show her I was serious.

626
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,620
这份日记就能证明
The journal was a way to do that.

627
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,020
我从没想过把日记交给她
I never came close to putting it in her possession.

628
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,070
我还要知道什么吗
Anything else I should know?

629
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,100
我戒酒了  已经87天了
I'm sober. It's been 87 days.

630
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,060
我是说关于邓巴
I meant in regards to Dunbar.

631
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,980
这是有关的  现在双方势均力敌
It is related. This is a tight race.

632
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,210
让我做你的幕僚长
Make me your Chief of Staff.

633
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,850
你保证过的
You promised.

634
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,580
你保证等我准备好了  这里会有我一席之地
You promised there'd be a place for me here when I was ready.

635
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,440
那是在你旧瘾复发
That was before you fell off the wagon

636
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,110
拿着日记走进来之前
and walked in here with that journal.

637
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,350
我犯过错
I've made mistakes.

638
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,730
我不止一次跌倒
I've fallen down more than once,

639
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,490
而你总会扶我起来
and you've always been there to pick me up.

640
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,030
但过去一年  你也不断跌倒
But you've been falling down for the past year, too,

641
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,850
这次你需要一个人来扶你
and you need someone to pick you up this time.

642
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,530
不是雷米  不是赛斯
It's not Remy. It's not Seth.

643
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,550
是我  弗兰克
It's me, Frank.

644
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,790
我怎么知道我能再次信任你呢
And how can I know I can ever trust you again?

645
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,980
因为我刚刚烧掉了两百万美元
Because I just lit two million dollars on fire.

646
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,520
到会人数可能比以往多  在180到220之间
We expect higher than usual turnout, anywhere from 180 to 220.

647
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,090
人越多越好
The higher the turnout, the better.

648
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,040
我们在女性和学生中较受欢迎
We're stronger with women and students.

649
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,030
-我们已争取到...  -抱歉  我得接这通电话
- We've got a GOTV-- - Excuse me, I have to take this.

650
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,130
道格
Doug?

651
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,070
关于日记  我有新消息要告诉你
I have an update regarding the journal.

652
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,100
是什么
What is it?

653
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,910
来自总统的口信
A message from the president.

654
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,410
我只有一件事要说
I have only one thing to say.

655
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,340
去你妈的
Go fuck yourself.

656
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,380
天呐  感觉太棒了
Christ, that felt good.

657
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,450
列一份最高法院的
Start putting together a shortlist

658
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,400
人选名单
of potential nominees for the court.

659
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,500
你已经...
You already...?

660
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,650
有我呢  先生
I'm on it, sir.

661
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,770
克莱尔
Claire.

662
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,660
要我叫楼下厨房
Want me to have them make you something

663
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,160
给你做点什么吗
from the downstairs kitchen?

664
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,970
不用  我在机上吃了  就是有点热
No, I ate on the plane. Just feeling a little warm.

665
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,720
会过去的
It'll pass.

666
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,750
道格怎么说
What did Doug say?

667
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,540
已经销毁了
It's destroyed.

668
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,050
我亲眼看他烧的
I watched him burn the page myself.

669
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,010
-有副本吗  -他说没有
- What about copies? - He says there aren't any.

670
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,170
你信任他吗
And you trust him?

671
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,940
他有的是机会搞破坏  但他没有
He had ample opportunity to do us real damage and he didn't.

672
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,880
-但他留了那么久  -我信他  克莱尔
- But he held onto it for so long-- - I believe him, Claire.

673
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,900
我信他
I believe him.

674
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,500
我要让他做幕僚长
And I'm gonna make him my Chief of Staff.

675
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,290
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

676
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:41,640
我们需要他  克莱尔  如今更甚以往
We need him, Claire. We need him now more than ever.

677
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,150
他背叛了我们  弗兰西斯
He betrayed us, Francis!

678
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,800
他把我的事告诉了邓巴
He told Dunbar about me.

679
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,520
是为了赢得她的信任  不是为了背叛我们
To gain her trust, not betray ours.

680
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,020
听我说  道格是我们一直以来唯一能信任的人
Look, Doug is the only person we've ever been able to trust,

681
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,640
而且他这次手段很高明
and he played this very smart.

682
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,150
他从未真的让我们有危险
He never put us in any real danger.

683
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,720
日记已经销毁  她做不了什么
The journal is gone. She can't do anything.

684
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,780
你让他回来之前  为什么不跟我商量
Why didn't you ask me before you brought him back?

685
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,730
-我们这不在商量吗  -你已经雇了他
- Bec-- We're discussing it now. - After you hired him!

686
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,920
听我说  我知道这事让你很揪心
Look. I know this must have been harrowing for you,

687
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,770
-但听我说  都结束了  -不  我不...
- but listen, it is ov-- - No. I don't--

688
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,740
我开始质疑一切了  弗兰西斯
I'm starting to question all of it, Francis.

689
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,720
这一切究竟有什么意义  我们这么做是为了什么
What any of it is worth. What... what are we doing this for?

690
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,980
为了这栋房子
For this house.

691
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,340
为了总统之位
For the presidency.

692
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,570
听我说  如果你需要休息几天  那没什么
Now, look, if you need to take a few days off, that's fine.

693
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,020
你明天不用跟我去爱荷华州
You do not have to come with me to Iowa tomorrow.

694
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,360
不  我当然要去
No. Of course, I'll be there.

695
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,250
欢迎回来  道格  恭喜了
Welcome back, Doug. Congratulations.

696
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,810
谢谢
Thank you.

697
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,370
我只想问下你打算
I just wanted to get a heads up on

698
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,120
什么时候正式宣布
when you'd like to make the formal announcement.

699
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,950
党团会议之后吧
Let's do it after the caucus.

700
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,040
不要让大家的注意力偏离竞选
I don't want to draw any attention away from the campaign.

701
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,600
那你今天别参加新闻发布会了
You probably shouldn't attend the press briefing today.

702
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,570
嗯  我会在那之前走的
No. I'll take off before then.

703
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,760
给  你该看看
Here, you should see this.

704
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,160
10分钟前曝出的
This just came out ten minutes ago.

705
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,350
你给总统看了吗
Have you shown the president?

706
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,720
我起草了讲话要点
I drafted up some talking points.

707
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,040
我觉得你会想去跟他说
I figured you'd want to brief him.

708
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,570
我回办公室了
I'll be in my office.

709
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,020
赛斯
Seth.

710
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,710
总统告诉我你也想做这工作
The president told me you asked for the job.

711
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,180
我当时不知道你也有这打算
Yeah, I didn't realize that you were in contention.

712
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,060
我不希望你怨我
I don't want you to resent me.

713
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,510
我是专业人士的
Hey, I'm a professional.

714
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,000
你如果要改讲话要点告诉我
Let me know if you want any changes made to the talking points.

715
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,780
肯定写的很好
I'm sure they're good.

716
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,420
拿去给总统吧
You can share 'em with the president.

717
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,650
你不要先过目吗
You don't want to look 'em over first?

718
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,940
不用  我相信你
No. I trust your judgment.

719
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,920
我可以告诉大家  名单正在筹办
I can tell you that the shortlist is coming along,

720
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,190
我有意在接下来两三周里
and it is my intention to nominate someone

721
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,400
就做出提名
within the next two or three weeks.

722
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,030
我们一定要行动快
It's very important that we do this quickly,

723
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,130
让参议院有时间进行听证
so that the Senate has time for their hearings.

724
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,940
这个位置本来也不好空太久
And we shouldn't leave that seat empty too long anyway,

725
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,710
法庭还要继续运行
while the Court is still in session.

726
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,580
-总统  -萨拉
- Mr. President? - Sara.

727
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,570
总统先生  您能就鲍德温女士关于
Mr. President, would you comment on Ms. Baldwin's article

728
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,270
约旦河谷行动的文章做下评论吗
about the Jordan Valley operation?

729
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,610
我觉得鲍德温女士的文章
I think Ms. Baldwin's article

730
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,310
不过是臆测
is really nothing more than speculation.

731
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,880
-但是证据  -什么
- But the evidence... - I'm sorry?

732
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,060
但她提出的证据很有说服力
But the evidence she presents is convincing.

733
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,520
证据  一封信吗
Evidence? A letter?

734
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,280
很遗憾  我虽不愿意
Unfortunately, I have to write letters like that

735
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,760
却不得不常写这种信
more often than I would like.

736
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,300
我觉得这仅仅能证明
And I don't think it's proof of anything more than

737
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,560
我曾写信给一个为国捐躯的
I reached out to the family of a young man

738
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,130
年轻人的家人
who sacrificed his life for our country

739
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:41,270
以及我对此永远充满谢意
and for which I am eternally grateful.

740
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,840
总统先生
Mr. President?

741
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,200
鲍德温女士  我们讨论的是你的文章
Well, Ms. Baldwin, it is your article we're discussing.

742
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,810
我想如果我不让你提问
I suppose I'd get hammered

743
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,530
恐怕会挨批评
if I didn't allow you to ask a question.

744
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,180
谢谢  总统先生  我的问题很简单
Thank you, Mr. President. My question is very straightforward.

745
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,180
您在信中提到
You mentioned in the letter

746
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,730
尼可斯中尉在演练中丧命
that Lieutenant Nix died in a training exercise.

747
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,390
您亲自在信上签名
You signed this letter with your own hand.

748
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,210
您能如实告诉我们他是这么死的吗
Can you tell us in all honesty that this is how he died?

749
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,390
我要告诉你
I can tell you that

750
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,090
这就是五角大楼向我报告的情况
this is exactly what the Pentagon reported to me.

751
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,070
除此之外  政府和国防部
And beyond that, it's not the policy of this administration

752
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,990
都不会讨论关于特种部队士兵
or the Department of Defense to discuss any specifics

753
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,860
死亡的详细情况
about any Special Forces deaths.

754
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,920
我能再问一个问题吗
May I ask one more, please?

755
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,700
我想这个话题已经讨论完了
I believe we're finished with that subject now.

756
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,830
是关于爱荷华
It's about Iowa.

757
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,900
好吧  问吧
Yes, all right. Go ahead.

758
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,800
您妻子出席了多场竞选活动
Your wife has been doing a lot of events.

759
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,050
她辞去在联合国的职位
Did she resign her post at the United Nations

760
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,890
是因为您觉得她作为竞选筹码
because you think she's more valuable as a campaign asset

761
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:24,900
比当大使更有价值吗
than an ambassador?

762
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,620
克莱尔确实出席了很多活动  这是事实
Claire has been doing a lot of events, that is true,

763
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,270
跟她以前参与我的每场竞选一样
as she has in every campaign that I have ever run.

764
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,650
我想我的策略是希望美国人民
I'm hoping, I suppose my strategy is that if the American people

765
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:34,950
看到我能凭聪明才智
can see that I was smart enough

766
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,950
娶到像克莱尔这样出色的女人
to marry an extraordinary woman like Claire,

767
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,340
他们或许会认为我也有
well, they might think I'm smart enough

768
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,220
当美国总统的脑子
to be President of the United States.

769
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,560
至于大使的事
As for the ambassadorship,

770
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,070
那完全是她的决定  不是我的
that was entirely her decision, not mine.

771
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,010
她喜欢竞选宣传  我也希望能今天稍后能
She enjoys campaigning, and I'm looking forward to getting back

772
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,880
回到爱荷华州陪伴她
to Iowa with her a little later today.

773
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,800
非常感谢各位
Thank you all very much.

774
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,620
我们知道他在加拉加斯[委瑞内拉首都]附近
We know he's somewhere near Caracas.

775
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,780
我需要找他回来
I need him back.

776
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,340
委瑞内拉方面不太配合
The Venezuelans haven't been cooperating.

777
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,060
我们有引渡令
We have extradition.

778
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,600
不代表他们会执行
Doesn't mean they'll enforce.

779
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,390
那就给我个准确地址
Then get me a precise location.

780
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,150
为什么
Why?

781
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,860
这跟你没关系
It doesn't concern you.

782
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,250
跟我有关  局里很多人
It does concern me. There are a lot of people

783
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,660
因为他的偷偷离境
at the agency who are embarrassed that

784
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,600
而丢了人
he crossed the border without us knowing.

785
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,420
那不是我的错
That's not my problem.

786
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,700
是你吗  护照解锁
Was it you? Passport lock?

787
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,080
能办到这事的再就只有国安部
The only other agency that could've lifted it is Homeland.

788
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,590
我知道你那里有朋友
I know you have friends there.

789
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,980
我到处都有朋友
I have friends everywhere.

790
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,040
我不会帮你擦屁股的  道格
I'm not gonna help you clean up your mess, Doug.

791
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,480
如果是你帮他出逃的话
Not if you helped him escape.

792
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,650
这不是请求
This isn't a request.

793
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,420
我现在是总统的幕僚长
I'm Chief of Staff to the president now.

794
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,190
-他还没宣布呢  -他会的
- He hasn't announced anyone. - He will.

795
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,330
如果你希望我的第一项正式工作
And if you want my first official task

796
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,500
就是找人代替你  那行啊
to be finding your replacement, so be it.

797
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,010
否则  就告诉我嘉文在哪
If not, you tell me where Gavin is.

798
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,400
我今早看了新闻发布会
I watched the press conference this morning.

799
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,900
我觉得鲍德温的文章会被淡忘的
I think the Baldwin article will blow over.

800
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,300
毫无力量  站不住脚
A non-story. No legs.

801
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,510
你说是我决定辞职的
You said it was my decision to resign.

802
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,270
确实是啊  不是吗
Well, it was, wasn't it?

803
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,160
至少我们是这样表现的
I mean, at least that's how we presented it.

804
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,800
我昨天在爱荷华跟一个女人聊天
I spoke with a woman yesterday in Iowa, who...

805
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,020
她说她不会支持我们
said she couldn't support us...

806
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:23,580
因为她不信任你
because she doesn't trust you.

807
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,540
我又不是第一个不被一些人信任的政客
Well, I'm not the first politician that some people don't trust.

808
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,700
我们已经撒谎很长时间了  弗兰西斯
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.

809
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,750
当然  想想如果我们开始说出真相
Of course we have. Imagine what the voters would think

810
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,310
选民会怎么想
if we started telling the truth.

811
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,100
不是对选民
Not to them.

812
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,390
是对彼此
To each other.

814
00:46:45,060 --> 00:47:10,060
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}提名最高法院法官  往往是一名美国总统任内最重要的工作之一
由于美国最高法院法官是终身制
一旦获得任命  大法官就可以一直工作下去
一名总统最多只能在白宫发号施令8年
他所提名的大法官却可以在最高法院影响美国社会长达几十年
在寻找合适人选时  总统们会选择同自己政见相似的候选人
但是由于任职后没有选举压力
大法官们在判案时并不见得总会站在自己所属的党派一边
小布什总统在离任前提名共和党人约翰·罗伯兹为最高法院首席大法官
但是当民主党总统奥巴马的《医疗保险改革法案》遇到麻烦时
罗伯兹却把自己关键的一票投给了支持奥巴马的一方

816
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:35,060
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}目前在任的九名大法官中
已经82岁高龄的民主党人露丝·金士堡是年龄最长的一位
金士堡曾两次罹患癌症  虽然都已治愈  但是健康状况欠佳
许多民主党人都在劝她尽快退休
这样现任总统奥巴马就有机会提名一位民主党法官来取代她
一旦民主党在2016年大选中失手  被共和党人占了白宫
而金士堡在2016年后退休  就会被一名共和党人取而代之
打破最高法院现有的平衡
但是倔强的金士堡拒绝听取这些劝退的意见
她总是回答说  奥巴马不可能找到比我更好的人选
在过去连续两年的国情咨文演讲中  奥巴马在台上口若悬河
坐在台下的金士堡却在打盹儿
不久前她在接受访问时承认  今年参加国情咨文前
跟最高法院几位法官同僚喝了几杯  才会在会场上忍不住打盹儿
