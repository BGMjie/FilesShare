谢尔登  先生  我是退休警员
Sheldon, sir. I'm a retired police officer.

17
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,720
那谢尔登一定是全州
Well, then I can only imagine that Sheldon must be

18
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,770
最安全的地方了
one of the safest places in this state.

19
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,310
我们尽力而为吧
We do our best.

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,130
但我儿子  他是海军陆战队  派驻在德怀尔营
But my son, he's a marine, stationed at Camp Dwyer.

21
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,000
他比我更能保护我们国家
He keeps our country safer than I do.

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,860
我和我妻子想问
Me and my wife were wondering,

23
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,270
如果他被派去约旦河谷
if he got sent over to the Jordan Valley,

24
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,130
这真能保护我们的安全吗
will that really keep us safer?

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,670
因为看起来  整个维和行动
Because it sure seems like the whole peacekeeping mission

26
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,220
只让局势更加危险了
is only making things more dangerous.

27
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,440
谢谢提问  可以给我吗
Thank you for that. May I?

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,610
首先  容我说
Well, first of all, let me say

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,750
我十分感激你儿子的奉献
how grateful I am for your son's service.

30
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,260
我知道大家都很感激
I know we all feel exactly the same way.

31
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,110
现在  我回答你的问题
And now, uh, let me try to answer your question.

32
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,250
俄方是否与我们产生了矛盾
Have we run into some difficulties with the Russians?

33
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,520
是的
Yes, we have.

34
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,610
以色列和巴勒斯坦之间是否关系紧张
Is there tension between the Israelis and the Palestinians?

35
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,720
没错
Absolutely.

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,700
但这正是此次行动如此重要的原因
But, that is the very reason that this mission is so important.

37
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,950
我们集结了一支七国联合军队
We have gathered together a coalition of seven nations

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,750
稳定一个数十载
to bring stability to a region

39
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,980
动荡不安的地区
that has suffered from unrest for decades.

40
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,480
这自然需要时间
It will take time.

41
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,950
可能会有人牺牲
And there may be lives that will be lost.

42
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,970
但这不仅仅事关中东安定
But this is not just important for the Middle East's security,

43
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,650
也关系到美国
it's important for the security

44
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,110
和整个世界的安全
of the United States and the rest of the world.

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,780
希望你的问题得到了解答
And I hope that I've answered your question.

46
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,530
下面谁来
Now, who was next?

47
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,040
我看看
Uh, let's see here.

48
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,710
这位年轻的小姐吧
Well, how about this young woman right here?

49
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,940
我把麦克风给你
Now, I'll give you my microphone,

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,490
但你得答应会还给我
but only if you promise to give it back.

51
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,750
他似乎不怎么想给我呢
He seemed to want to hang onto it for a while.

52
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,750
-给  -我叫安妮·怀茨
- There you are. - Um, my name is Annie Wietz,

53
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,900
我也担心那位警官所说的事
and I'm also worried about what the officer was just saying.

54
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,930
我希望我孙辈能生活在安全的世界里
I want a safe world for my grandkids--

55
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,830
把麦克风给我  我回答你
Give me back the mic - and I'll answer your question.

56
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,540
我还没提问呢
No, sir. I haven't asked my question yet.

57
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,760
抱歉  我着急了  请
Apologies. I'm ahead of myself. Go ahead.

58
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,070
那项秘密行动  导致以色列入境的
The covert operation, the one that caused the Israelis to invade.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,550
是我们吗  因为看起来
Was that us? Because that really seemed

60
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,550
那事把情况搞得一团糟
to make a mess of everything.

61
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,950
-可以给我吗  -请
- May I? - Please.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,640
谢谢  安妮
Thank you. Now, Annie?

63
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,880
-是安妮吧  -是  先生
- Is that your name, yeah? - Yes, sir.

64
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,610
这事我已经说过了
Now, I have said this on this matter before,

65
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,400
我知道大家或许有不满  但事实如此
and I know it may be frustrating, but it is the truth.

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,520
对任何国家的秘密行动
When it comes to covert operations by any nation,

67
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,750
或情报问题  出于安全考虑
or matters of intelligence, for security purposes,

68
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,070
也包括我们本国战士的安全
including the security of our own soldiers,

69
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,810
我实在不能发表评论
I simply cannot comment on these issues.

70
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,130
但是  先生  抱歉
But, sir, I'm sorry,

71
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,390
如果你不肯回答
but what is the point of having us ask questions

72
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,010
-我们还何必提问  -被她说着了
- if you won't answer them? - Well, she's got me there. Uh...

73
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,740
除了这个问题我都能回答
I can answer any question but that one.

74
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,770
事实上  希望大家能问问
In fact, I hope that we can ask some questions about

75
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,230
我们要如何解决国内的一些问题
how we're gonna focus on things right here at home.

76
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,000
楼上二等座的人来问吧
How about someone up there in the cheap seats?

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,010
有人想问吗
Anyone have a question there?

78
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,210
约旦河谷的局势
The situation in Jordan Valley,

79
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,920
可能会引起境外流血冲突
it threatens to bleed across the border.

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,630
已经有难民请求进入约旦了
We already have refugees requesting to enter Jordan.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,910
抱歉  里亚德王子
Forgive me, Prince Ryad.

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,250
你们虽然要应付几百个难民
You may be dealing with a few hundred refugees,

83
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,980
但我们可是要面对迫击炮袭击
but we are facing mortar attacks.

84
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,670
这两周就发生了14起
Fourteen in the last two weeks.

85
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,040
你们还没死人呢
None of your people have died yet.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,400
最后的一次  离一所学校只有50米
The last one came within 50 meters of a school.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,370
你们的军队袭击民宅  杀死了十数名巴勒斯坦人
Your troops have killed over a dozen Palestinians in house raids.

88
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,840
你还指望我们不还击吗
You expect us not to fight back?

89
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,490
暴力冲突必须停止
We need the violence to stop.

90
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,400
如果继续下去  维和任务会分崩离析
If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart.

91
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,010
而维和任务是长久稳定的最佳机会
And it's our best hope for long-term stability.

92
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,430
你能跟哈马斯和真主党沟通吗
Can you speak to Hamas and Hezbollah?

93
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,100
让他们同意停火
Get them to agree to a cease-fire?

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,850
以色列自维和任务开始后
Israel has twice as many troops in the region

95
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,620
在当地的驻军翻了一番
as before the peacekeeping mission began.

96
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,610
不  我们才是在自卫
No, it is we who are defending ourselves.

97
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,770
你答应撤离两千士兵了
You agreed to remove two thousand troops.

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,440
如果迫击炮袭击停止
If there's a cessation of mortar attacks,

99
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,660
如果俄军离开
and if the Russians leave.

100
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,900
派军削减三分之一
A one-third troop reduction.

101
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,130
这足以说服你们的人了吧
That should be enough to convince your people, no?

102
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,470
等以军离开  我再去找他们  之前不行
Once the troops leave, I engage them, but not before.

103
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,820
显示点诚意吧  就算到时你还有四千士兵呢
Show some goodwill. You'll still have 4,000 troops there.

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,430
因为这样下去将毫无进展
Because we cannot accomplish anything

105
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,510
除非能证明双方都愿缓和局势
unless we have proof of de-escalation on both sides.

106
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,580
那俄国呢
What about Russia?

107
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,460
这是另外的问题了  我们改日再解决
That's a separate issue. We will tackle that another time.

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,960
你能向耶路撒冷转达
Can you convey to Jerusalem

109
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,500
此次部分撤军的重要性吗
the importance of this troop reduction?

110
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,950
可以  但结果无法保证
Yes, but no promises.

111
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,990
好吧  谢谢各位
All right. Thank you, everyone.

112
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,280
我们明早再会面
We'll meet again tomorrow morning.

113
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,230
谢谢  夫人
Thank you, madam.

114
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,960
伊莉安娜
Eliana.

115
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,150
我们得讨论禁飞区的问题
We need to discuss the no-fly zone.

116
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,670
那是给俄国人定的  不是维和军
It's only for the Russians, not the peacekeepers.

117
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,070
他们如果断了粮  就待不下去
They can't stay if they have nothing to eat.

118
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,680
你打算怎么做  把供给货机打下来吗
What are you going to do, shoot down a supply plane?

119
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,780
希望他们不会逼我们做这个选择
We hope they won't make us face that choice.

120
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,550
他们会无视的
They'll ignore it.

121
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,080
你这样只会激怒莫斯科
And you're just going to antagonize Moscow.

122
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,860
抱歉  但禁飞区的事是上方定下的
I'm sorry, but the no-fly zone is above my pay grade.

123
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,080
或许你丈夫可以去跟总理谈谈
Perhaps your husband can talk to the prime minister.

124
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,020
什么时候开始
When are we looking at?

125
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,500
或许是明天  或许一周后
Could be tomorrow, could be a week.

126
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,290
那些事已经轮不到我插嘴了
I'm not a part of those conversations anymore.

127
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,490
我们可以审查问题
We could vet the questions.

128
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,030
那在爱荷华州行不通  只会激起民愤
That doesn't work in Iowa. It'll piss people off.

129
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,690
即便如此也无济于事
Even if we did, it wouldn't make a difference.

130
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,870
整个国家的心思都在约旦河谷上
The country is preoccupied with the Jordan Valley.

131
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,980
话题完全跑偏了
We're off message.

132
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,610
现在
In the meantime,

133
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,350
我们可以暂停市政厅集会  只做巡回宣传
we can put the town halls on hold. Just do the stump.

134
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,250
我觉得辩论也最好延迟
I think we should also postpone the debate.

135
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,200
邓巴会为此狠狠攻击你  说你在回避
Dunbar'll hit you hard for that. Say you're dodging.

136
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,090
那让杰姬提出推迟
Have Jackie request the postponement.

137
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,390
-什么理由  -我不管
- What's her reason? - I don't care.

138
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,060
只要不是我们提出来就行
Just as long as it isn't coming from us.

139
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,520
跟她谈谈  谢谢了  各位
Talk to her. Thank you, gentlemen.

140
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,760
接下来什么事
What's next?

141
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,420
为竞选筹款打电话  直到4点15
Uh, you're slated for fundraising calls until 4:15,

142
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,360
然后是国防部的简报
then a DOD briefing.

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,030
另外  你桑蒂诺的朋友  蒂姆·科贝特打来了
Also, your friend from The Sentinel called, Tim Corbet.

144
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,990
谢谢
Thank you.

145
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,140
我自己会叠衣服
You know, I can fold my own clothes.

146
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,650
不费事
Took me two seconds.

147
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,770
记得我大四那年我们睡一间房吗
You remember when we shared a room my senior year?

148
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,040
我要是把一只袜子丢在地板上  你就会抓狂
And if I left, like, one sock on the floor, you'd freak?

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,890
我后来开始有意那么做  好看你发火
Yeah, I started doing that on purpose, just to see you flip out.

150
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,340
嗯  我记得
Yeah. I remember.

151
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,820
得了  别管了  随意点
Come on, leave it. Be a rebel.

152
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,880
亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,090
告诉她如果动了  就是要掉了
Well, tell her if it wiggles, it means it's gonna fall out.

154
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,630
好  让她听
Okay. Let me talk to her.

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
听我说
Uh, now, listen to me. You--

156
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,910
我知道你妈妈不让你动
I know your mom doesn't want you playing with it,

157
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,410
你得听她话
so you have to do what she says.

158
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,440
因为牙仙不喜欢上面沾满指纹
Well, because the tooth fairy doesn't want fingerprints all over it.

159
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,870
好  我答应  但你保证
Okay, I'll do it, but you have to promise me

160
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,420
你和你弟弟都不会再摆弄牙了
that you and your brother will stop playing with your tooth.

161
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,130
好  准备好了吗
Okay, you ready?

162
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,040
真的准备好了吗
Are you super ready?

163
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,390
咪咪喵  咪咪喵  咪咪喵
Boogala, boogala, boogala, boogala, boogala.

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,250
好了  让妈妈听
Okay. Put your mom back on.

165
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,690
推迟多久
How much of a postponement?

166
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,790
直到我们解决危机
Until we get this crisis resolved.

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,860
邓巴一眼就看穿了
Dunbar will see right through that.

168
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,110
除非是你说
Not if it's coming from you.

169
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,900
就说你现在想当面接触民众
Say you want to focus on meeting people face to face,

170
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,210
而不是电视辩论
not a televised debate.

171
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,160
我们会支持你
We'll back you up.

172
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,030
好  我跟我手下谈谈
All right, I'll talk to my staff.

173
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
我们起草一下言辞  再给你看一下
We'll draft some language and I'll run it past you.

174
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,150
杰姬
Jackie?

175
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,160
我想跟你谈谈两周前的那件事
I want to talk to you about what happened a couple weeks ago.

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,630
-我越界了  -雷米  你不用解释
- I crossed a line. - Remy, you don't have to.

177
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,380
我想解释一下
I want to. I want to explain myself.

178
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,140
我对你还有感觉  这我不否认
I still have strong feelings, I'm not gonna deny that.

179
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,860
如果情况不同  我不做这个
Maybe a different job... A different time, different place.

180
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,850
可是...
But, uh...

181
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,260
听我说
Look...

182
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,030
我以前也放下过曾经爱过的人
I've loved people before, and I've learned to let 'em go.

183
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,640
我再不会让你为难了
I'm not gonna put you in that position again.

184
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,880
对我也不容易
It's been hard for me, too.

185
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,100
你还有工作
You've got work.

186
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,380
我很高兴你说出来了
I'm glad you said something.

187
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,510
喂
Hello?

188
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,620
蒂姆  是弗兰克
Tim, it's Frank.

189
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,680
抱歉这么晚才回你电话
I'm sorry it took me all day to get back to you.

190
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,390
没事  你现在一定忙死了
Ah, no worries. Your plate must be pretty full.

191
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,580
我的确希望能没这么多事
Well, more than I'd like at the moment.

192
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,930
打扰你了吗
Is this a bad time?

193
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,570
我还是能腾出点时间
I think I can spare a few minutes

194
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,450
跟美国总统通话的
for the President of the United States.

195
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,920
-你好吗  -挺好
- Are you good? - Yeah.

196
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,580
最后一个孩子也去大学了
Good. Uh, last kid got off to college,

197
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,060
家里就剩贝丝和我了
so Beth and I are on our own.

198
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,330
总算  生意不错
Finally. Yeah, the business is strong.

199
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,980
我还打算扩张到格伦伍德峡谷呢
I'm actually, uh, I'm thinking of expanding to Glenwood Canyon.

200
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,930
那好啊
That's great.

201
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,530
听我说  我打给你是因为
Listen, I called because that,

202
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,910
那个作者来找我了
that writer reached out to me.

203
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,840
给你写书的那个
You know, the one doing your book.

204
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,080
说要跟我谈谈桑蒂诺的事
Said, uh, he wanted to talk about The Sentinel.

205
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,210
你怎么说的
What'd you say?

206
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,850
我说我有点急事  回头打给他
I said I was in a rush and I'd call him back later.

207
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,320
没跟你商量过  我不想多说什么
I didn't want to say more without talking to you first.

208
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,070
他应该先问我的
Well, he should've checked with me beforehand.

209
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,800
我可不希望他去骚扰我的朋友
I don't want him harassing my friends.

210
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,470
他倒是没有骚扰我  他人不错
He wasn't harassing me at all. He's a nice guy, actually.

211
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,010
如果对你的书有用  我乐意跟他谈
I mean, I'm happy to talk with him if it'll help your book.

212
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,630
这书不是讲桑蒂诺的
Well, the book isn't really about The Sentinel,

213
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,710
真不知他是何必
so I don't know why he'd bother,

214
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,590
但我会跟他谈谈  回头给你回复
but I'll talk to him and I'll let you know.

215
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,870
随你  总统先生
Whatever you need, Mr. President.

216
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,120
你够了
Stop that.

217
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,370
听我说  我们给三军统帅打对折
Hey, listen, uh, we run a half-price special for Commanders-in-Chief.

218
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,990
你什么时候来科罗拉多州
So, uh... if you're ever in Colorado

219
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,380
又有时间
with some time on your hands...

220
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,130
希望前总统也有这待遇
Well, I hope the same goes for ex-presidents, too.

221
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,590
不行  只针对在任总统  你最好拿下选举
Nope. Only sittin' ones. So you better win that damn election.

222
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,000
那我尽力  跟你聊天真愉快  蒂姆
I'll do my best. Nice talking to you, Tim.

223
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,300
我也是  弗兰克
You too, Frank.

224
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,980
单独安排汤姆·耶茨明天来见我
I want to set aside time for Tom Yates, in person. Tomorrow.

225
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,820
是  先生
Yes, sir.

226
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,820
嗯
Yes.

227
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,430
弗兰西斯
Francis?

228
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,700
我刚跟凯茜打完电话
I just got off the phone with Cathy.

229
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,020
以色列要实施禁飞区了
The Israelis are instituting the no-fly zone.

230
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,480
我安排了明天跟总理通话呢
I'm scheduled to have a call tomorrow with the prime minister.

231
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,790
他们要取消通话
They want to cancel the call.

232
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,410
我看看能不能现在接通他
Let me see if I can get him on the phone now.

233
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,740
他们已向所有大使馆发布了公告
They just sent out a communiqué to all embassies.

234
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,110
早上好
Good morning.

235
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,910
诸位...
As you--

236
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,580
抱歉  昨晚很繁忙
Excuse me. It's been a long night.

237
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,850
谢谢
Thank you.

238
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,420
以色列于当地时间今早6点  在约旦河谷上空
Israel instituted a no-fly zone over the Jordan Valley,

239
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,150
实施了禁飞区
6:00 a.m. today, Israeli time.

240
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,090
我虽然反对此举
And while I disagree with this action,

241
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,380
我能理解其初衷
I understand the reason behind it,

242
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,740
我们必须与同盟同一阵线
and we must stand with our ally.

243
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,200
我们的主要目标仍是缓和当地局势
Our chief goal remains de-escalation in the region.

244
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,320
安德伍德大使和国务院
Ambassador Underwood and the State Department

245
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,010
在与各相关方为此目标进行努力
are working with all interested parties toward that end.

246
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,940
我们的优先考虑是保证平民安全
Our utmost priority is guaranteeing civilian safety.

247
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,160
-以色列已经证实...  -什么时候去得梅因[爱荷华首府]
- And Israel has confirmed -When are you off to Des Moines?

248
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,930
两小时后  还得先给几个资助人打电话
A couple of hours. I have to make some donor calls first.

249
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,510
今天有手术吗
You have surgery today?

250
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,580
两个搭桥手术  明天三个
A double bypass. Triple tomorrow.

251
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,530
但之后一周几乎没什么安排
But nothing scheduled for almost a week after,

252
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,520
所以或许我可以去爱荷华州  我们...
so maybe I can come out to Iowa and we can--

253
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,580
-俄国飞机如无视...  -怎么了
- Russian aircrafts that ignore this... - What's going on?

254
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,050
可能遭受军事打击
...could potentially be subject to military action...

255
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,680
约旦河谷真是一团糟
This Jordan Valley thing's a mess.

256
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,130
他有大麻烦了
He's in big trouble.

257
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,090
...此类举动
...any such actions...

258
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,020
还有《美就法》那档子事
And then there's the whole AmWorks thing.

259
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,870
去年留下的包袱
All the baggage from last year.

260
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,430
-你后悔了吗  -不知道
- You having doubts? - I don't know.

261
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,960
或许吧
Maybe.

262
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,180
这好像挺严肃啊
That sounds serious.

263
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,440
如果说有抛弃他的理想时机  就是现在了
If there was an ideal time to walk away, now is it.

264
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,190
然后呢
And then what?

265
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,210
专心于国会
Focus on Congress.

266
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,350
但你的野心不止如此啊
Yeah, but you want more than that.

267
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,540
我可以多陪陪你和孩子
I could spend more time with you and the kids.

268
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,580
我不希望妻子
Well, I don't want a wife who's miserable

269
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,670
因为放弃了白宫而怨念不已
because she turned her back on the White House.

270
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,590
听我说
Look...

271
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,170
手术一旦开始  就不能停下
The thing about surgery is, once you're in, you're in.

272
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,940
你面前是一颗跳动的心脏  别人的生命
There's a beating heart in front of you. Someone's life.

273
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,960
不能有迟疑
There's no room for doubt.

274
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,250
不论出了什么问题
So, whatever goes wrong...

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,910
比如大出血  或者血块  也只能去应付
say hemorrhage or a blood clot, you deal with it.

276
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,470
你不能放弃
You don't get to walk away.

277
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,770
但那是生死大事  这不是
But that's life or death. This isn't.

278
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,370
对你来说是的
It is for you.

279
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,820
维持国际和平和稳定
...to maintain international peace and security.

280
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,770
美国决心解决当前事态
The United States is committed to defusing this situation.

281
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,570
我们会支持以色列  支持巴勒斯坦
We are here for Israel, we are here for Palestine,

282
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,440
也支持俄罗斯
we are here for Russia.

283
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,410
我们会...
And we are here for--

284
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,670
-可以去参加会面了吗  -嗯
- Ready to go to your meeting? - Yeah.

285
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,890
走吧
Come on.

286
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,560
我在想
I was thinking...

287
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,080
你前一阵
you know how a while back,

288
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,290
说要让孩子从俄亥俄州过来
you mentioned the kids coming out from Ohio?

289
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,500
你希望他们来吗
You want them to visit?

290
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,540
或许你不希望他们看到我这样
Well, maybe you don't want them to see me like this?

291
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,560
-复健  戒酒  -你表现一直很棒
- Doing my 60 days? - You've been doing great.

292
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,470
我当然乐意让他们来看叔叔
I'd be thrilled for them to come out here and meet their uncle,

293
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,030
如果你真想的话
if that's something you want to do.

294
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,090
我可以在沙发上睡几晚
I could hit the couch for a few nights.

295
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,960
你们睡卧房
You guys can have the bedroom.

296
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,330
我打给萨拉
I'll call Sarah.

297
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,330
我要对以色列说  留着你们的领空吧
I say to Israel, keep your airspace.

298
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,260
留着你们的禁飞区吧
Keep your no-fly zone.

299
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,960
我还是会飞过去
I will be flying through it, nevertheless.

300
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,280
你要是想  就把我打下来
Shoot me down, if you wish,

301
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
因为什么都别想阻止我
because nothing can stop me

302
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,860
去跟我的同胞站在一起
from standing side by side with my countrymen.

303
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,630
我要去拥抱为国奉献的士兵
I will embrace the men who serve this country,

304
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,430
因为我是俄国人
because I am Russian,

305
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,790
俄国人  不抛弃自己人
and Russians... do not abandon their own.

306
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,640
俄国电视台
Russian TV.

307
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,360
45分钟前  可能是大话
Forty-five minutes ago. It could be hot air.

308
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,360
佩特罗夫想让全世界都看到
Petrov wants the world to see this.

309
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,960
如果不是真心的  就不会公开放话
He wouldn't put it out there unless he meant it.

310
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,340
以色列说他们打算执行禁飞区令
Israel says they're prepared to enforce the no-fly zone.

311
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,960
他们不会把一国元首打下来的
They'll never shoot down a head of state.

312
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,390
那他们就会丢面子
Yeah, which means they'll lose face

313
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,880
进而增加派军  来挽回这个面子
and compensate by increasing their ground presence.

314
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,170
我让耶路撒冷同意部分撤军了
I got Jerusalem to agree to a pullout.

315
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,710
-两千士兵  -如果佩特罗夫飞过去就没戏了
- Two thousand troops. - Not if Petrov flies there.

316
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,760
如果我们把佩特罗夫的行为说成政治作秀
If we downplay Petrov's move as political theatrics,

317
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,670
我或许还能说服以色列人按原计划走
I might be able to convince the Israelis to follow through.

318
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,240
不行  我们得直接回应俄罗斯
No, we need to respond to Russia directly,

319
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,720
而不是跟以色列浪费时间
not waste our time with Israel.

320
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,300
以色列是我们的同盟  跟他们谈
Israel is our ally. We're far more likely

321
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,510
比跟俄罗斯谈更可能产生结果
to have a productive dialogue with them than with Russia.

322
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,210
对  但我们的主要目标是什么
Yes. What's our main objective here?

323
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,980
让俄军撤离约旦河谷
To get Russian troops out of the Jordan Valley.

324
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,960
我们别再拐弯抹角了
Let's stop poking around from the sides.

325
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,650
我们得正面面对问题
We need to tackle this head on.

326
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,500
跟莫斯科取得联系
Open up a line of communication with Moscow.

327
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,490
告诉他们我要亲自去约旦河谷
Tell them I'm coming to the Jordan Valley myself.

328
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,370
先生
Sir, I--

329
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,980
我要在当地跟佩特罗夫面谈
I'm gonna meet with Petrov face to face, on the ground.

330
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,180
-总统先生  这么做的风险  -我知道
- Mr. President, the risk factors of - I'm well aware.

331
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,470
佩特罗夫一动身就通知我
I want to be notified the moment that Petrov is on his way.

332
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,260
你跟中情局和国防部合作
You work with the CIA and DOD

333
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,890
解决一切必要后勤和安全问题
to figure out any logistics and security you have to.

334
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,200
找赛斯  开始起草措辞
Talk to Seth. Let's start drafting our message.

335
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,070
凯茜  我要跟你和国防部谈谈
Cathy, I want to sit down with you and Defense,

336
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,250
看我们有什么筹码
and work out bargaining chips.

337
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,300
谢谢各位
Thank you all very much.

338
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,210
马上行动
I meant now.

339
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,400
-不得打扰我  -您安排了跟耶茨先生的见面
- I'm not to be disturbed. - You have a meeting with Mr. Yates.

340
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,280
让他等  告诉他我得好一会儿
Have him wait and tell him it might be a while.

341
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,190
是  先生
Yes, sir.

342
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,260
莫里科夫大使为您接通了
You're on with Ambassador Moryakov.

343
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,210
-亚历克西  -你在浪费时间  克莱尔
- Alexi? - You're wasting your time, Claire.

344
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,800
我们不能让佩特罗夫去
We can't let Petrov go.

345
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,320
我无能为力
I'm powerless.

346
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,890
那告诉我能找谁去说动他
Then tell me who we can speak to who can influence him.

347
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,600
他心意已决  没人敢为此跟他唱反调
His mind is made up. No one would dare challenge him on this.

348
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,070
好吧  那我去纽约  我们见见卡斯皮
All right, then I'll come to New York. Let's meet with Caspi.

349
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,870
我们一起安抚耶路撒冷的担心
We'll ease Jerusalem's fears together.

350
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,720
不行  我正要去华盛顿
I can't. I'm on my way to Washington.

351
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,450
-为什么  -大使馆召我去
- What for? - The embassy sent for me.

352
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,060
我被召回了
I'm being recalled.

353
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,330
-是因为...  -我不知道
- Is it because...? - I don't know.

354
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,180
亚历克西  如果你需要什么
Alexi, if you need anything--

355
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,350
大使已经挂断  安德伍德夫人
The ambassador has ended the call, Mrs. Underwood.

356
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,350
-安德伍德夫人  -你好
- Mrs. Underwood. - Hello.

357
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,460
-艾德华  -稍等
- Edward? - Wait here a moment.

358
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,640
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am?

359
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,990
他来干什么
What's he doing here?

360
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,690
总统要见他
The president wanted to meet with him.

361
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,100
他叫我安排他去楼上等着
He asked me to have him wait upstairs.

362
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,330
-谢谢  -夫人
- Thank you. - Yes, ma'am.

363
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,620
如果他的要求还跟此前一样
If he wants the same terms as we had before,

364
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,950
我会努力说服我们北约的盟国
I'll smooth it over with our NATO allies.

365
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,620
失去波兰的确不妙  但我觉得芬兰海
It's tough to lose Poland, but I think that we can compensate

366
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,570
这里巡逻的反导弹潜艇可以起补偿作用
with anti-missile subs on patrol here in the Finnish Sea.

367
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,310
弗兰西斯  有空吗
Francis? Do you have a moment?

368
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,200
我就回来
I'll be right back.

369
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,820
让我们单独谈谈
Give us a minute.

370
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,980
我觉得这是个错误  你这是追他
I think this is a mistake. You're chasing him.

371
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,630
-让我去做以色列的工作  -你一直在做
- Let me work with Israel. - You've been working with Israel.

372
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,270
结果现在闹出个禁飞区  进一步  退两步
Now there's a no-fly zone. One step forward, two steps back.

373
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,860
外交需要时间
Diplomacy takes time.

374
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,460
爱荷华两个月后就投票了
Iowa is in two months.

375
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,170
你不能让竞选决定外交政策
You can't let the campaign drive our foreign policy.

376
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,840
如果我拿不下爱荷华  就没什么外交政策可言了
If I don't win in Iowa, there is no foreign policy.

377
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,310
抱歉  总统先生
Excuse us, Mr. President.

378
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,150
我们别在这儿说了
Let's not talk out here.

379
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,080
如果你去了约旦河谷
If you go to the Jordan Valley,

380
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,740
就必须谈出个结果来
you have to walk away with a solution.

381
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,480
他也知道  这样筹码就都在他手里了
And he knows that, which means he gets all the leverage.

382
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,140
我们现在也没什么筹码啊
Well, it's not as if we have much leverage at the moment.

383
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,330
他会希望中止维和任务
He's going to want the peacekeeping mission out.

384
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,760
没错  还有拆除导弹防御系统
That's right. And the missile defense system, too.

385
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,670
如果有必要  我两样都会满足他
And I'm prepared to give him both if necessary.

386
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,810
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

387
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,970
别放弃维和任务  弗兰西斯
Don't toss the mission aside, Francis.

388
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,990
克莱尔  这事你太动感情
Claire, you're too invested in this.

389
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,110
维和任务已经完了
The mission is dead.

390
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,700
那些士兵炸死的时候就完了
It was dead the moment those troops got blown up.

391
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,470
你的计划失败了  很抱歉
Your plan failed. I'm sorry.

392
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,010
是我的错  是我批准了
It's my fault. I approved it.

393
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,220
但现在  我得去挽救
But now, I have to fix it.

394
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,190
你为什么不肯相信外交手段
Why won't you place faith in a diplomatic solution?

395
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,630
这就是外交
This is diplomacy.

396
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,780
有时候就得靠两个人  在一个房间里谈
Sometimes it comes down to two men in a room.

397
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,530
我现在对联合国已经不抱希望了
I have no faith in the UN anymore.

398
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,420
但我相信我可以跟此人谈妥
I do have faith in my ability to negotiate with this man.

399
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,500
弗兰西斯  我知道你看重我的想法
Francis, I know you value my opinion.

400
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,300
当然  超过一切
Absolutely, above all others.

401
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,330
我们对如何处理俄罗斯
We have both put a great deal of effort

402
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,020
都耗尽心思和努力
and thought into how to handle Russia.

403
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,540
我希望这次我们能共同做决定
I'd like for this to be a decision we make together,

404
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,470
而不是冲动地回应...
instead of an impulsive response--

405
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,880
-待会儿的  -佩特罗夫起飞了
- Not right now. - Petrov's in the air.

406
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,280
接戴尔海军上将
Get Admiral Dale on the line.

407
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,980
克莱尔  我看重你的想法
Claire, I value your opinion.

408
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,690
但我这次不认同你
I just don't agree with it this time.

409
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,890
耶茨先生
Mr. Yates.

410
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
总统只能重新安排了
The president's gonna have to reschedule.

411
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,660
托马斯
Thomas.

412
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,080
能让我们谈谈吗  艾德华
You give us a few moments, Edward?

413
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,590
是  夫人  我就在楼梯处
Yes, ma'am. I'll be by the stairs.

414
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,210
书写得如何了
How's the book coming?

415
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,450
我有点遇到障碍了
I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

416
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,970
缺失了很大一块
There's a big piece missing.

417
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,800
-是什么  -你
- What is it? - You.

418
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,570
他完全没提我吗
He hasn't... mentioned me at all?

419
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,470
提过很多  但不够
Plenty of times, but... it's not enough.

420
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,220
他怎么说的
What has he said?

421
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,200
你这让我很难做啊  安德伍德夫人
You're putting me in an awkward position, Mrs. Underwood.

422
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,400
你不想背叛他的信任
You don't want to betray his trust.

423
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,830
他和我有协议
He and I have an agreement.

424
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,360
我理解  我不该打听  我不打扰你了
I understand. I shouldn't pry. I'll leave you be, then.

425
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,040
他说他爱你超过一切
He said he loves you more than anything.

426
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,600
说没有你就不能入主白宫
That there wouldn't be a White House without you.

427
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,640
他带我去了加夫尼  你们第一个家
He showed me your first house... in Gaffney.

428
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,200
你种郁金香的地方
Where you planted the tulips.

429
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,350
他说他很羞耻
And he said he was ashamed.

430
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,540
为什么
Of what?

431
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,020
你嫁给了他  因为你能找更好的
That you married him. Because you deserve better.

432
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,460
你真的应该出现在这本书里  安德伍德夫人
You should really be in this book, Mrs. Underwood.

433
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,200
我有很多从他视角出发的故事
I've got a lot of stories from his perspective.

434
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,510
但没有一个是你的视角
Not a single one from yours.

435
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,830
是他要竞选总统啊  不是我
Well, he's the one running for president, not me.

436
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,650
嗯
Yeah.

437
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,640
我也说不好  或许是我错了
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

438
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,950
我觉得人们要听听你的声音才能听到他的话
I think people need to hear your voice to hear his.

439
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,760
我们可以安排一次见面吗
Can we set up a time to meet?

440
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,170
我想想吧  谢谢你  托马斯
I'll think about it. Thank you, Thomas.

441
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:38,970
好吧
Okay.

442
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,580
赛斯  这不错  但再把期望降低一些
Seth, this is good, but downplay expectations even more.

443
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,250
结果还很难说呢
There's no telling what we'll walk away with.

444
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,000
-是  先生  -出于安全考虑
- Yes, sir. - We shouldn't inform the press

445
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,040
我们应该等您着陆再通知媒体
until after you land, for security purposes.

446
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,020
唐纳德
Donald...

447
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,010
-如果我出了事  -我准备好了
- If anything should happen to me - I'm prepared.

448
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,140
-但不会有事的  -上帝保佑
- But nothing will. - God help us.

449
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,330
丹顿会给你完整的情况报告
Danton will walk you through the full brief.

450
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,710
战况室都准备好了
Everything's set up in the Situation Room.

451
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,280
-好运  总统先生  -谢谢  我就回来
- Good luck, Mr. President. - Thank you. I'll be right back.

452
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,000
听我说  我知道你对此有反对
Now, listen, I know you have reservations about all this.

453
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,570
你在采取你认为最好的办法
You're doing what you think is best.

454
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,890
一定小心
Please be careful out there.

455
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:17,860
我会的
I will.

456
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,050
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. - I love you, too.

457
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,620
走吧
Let's go.

458
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,210
有人吗
Hello?

459
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,020
你好  天呐  你们还真像
Hello! Wow! You guys really look alike!

460
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,380
好吧
Okay.

461
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,950
我们一家人喜欢抱抱
We're a hugging family.

462
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,170
看出来了
I see.

463
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,560
你是弗朗辛吧
Hi, you must be Francine.

464
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,390
-才不是  -她喜欢叫弗朗琪
- No, I'm not! - She likes Franke better.

465
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,310
认识你很高兴  弗朗琪
Nice to meet you, Franke.

466
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
-不要  -没错
- No. - Yep.

467
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,760
-我说了吧  -小心点
- I told you! - Careful.

468
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,370
-这是道格叔叔  -这是谁啊
- It's your Uncle Doug. - Hey, who's that?

469
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,290
要去跟道格叔叔抱抱吗
Do you want to give your Uncle Doug a hug?

470
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,450
过来
Come here, you.

471
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,910
我们会在特拉维夫市着陆
We'll land in Tel Aviv,

472
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,390
然后由特种部队护送
then take a special forces convoy

473
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,090
至河谷边界
from there to the perimeter of the valley.

474
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,660
到达河谷之前  以色列都会提供空中支援
The Israelis will provide air support until we get to the valley,

475
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,200
然后我们的直升机接手
then our helos will take over.

476
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,300
达到营地后
Once we get to the camp,

477
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,570
俄国人坚持我们只保留地面小队
the Russians insist on ground units only.

478
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,990
我们会通过一个检查点
We'll pass through a checkpoint--

479
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,730
这里有多安全
How secure is this location?

480
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,960
该地点的防守我们并不满意
The position is not fortified to our liking.

481
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,340
不能防爆
It's not blast-proof.

482
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,640
长官  我们要请您穿防弹衣戴头盔
Sir, we're going to ask that you wear your Kevlar and helmet.

483
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,130
先生
Sir?

484
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,640
玛丽
Mary.

485
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,420
为什么没有让记者随行
Why were no press allowed to go?

486
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,040
鉴于安全局势
Given the security situation,

487
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,960
我们不想让记者涉险
we didn't want to put any press in harm's way,

488
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,730
或冒险让敌方提前得知消息
or risk any hostile elements knowing in advance.

489
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,730
那么总统已经着陆了吗
So the president has already landed?

490
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,240
大概90分钟前
About 90 minutes ago.

491
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,950
马克
Mark.

492
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,020
总统究竟希望达成什么目的
What exactly does the president hope to achieve?

493
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,830
理想情况是俄方离开该地区
Ideally, we'd like the Russians to vacate the region.

494
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,340
但这无法保证
We can't promise that they will.

495
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,790
但总统希望
But the president hopes

496
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,120
我们能就撤兵取得进展
that we can make progress toward a withdrawal.

497
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,380
凯特
Kate.

498
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,060
这可被视为选举作秀
This could be seen as an election stunt.

499
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,620
他在民调中落后邓巴  所以想挽救大局
He's trailing Dunbar in the polls, so he wants to save the day.

500
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,100
我保证  这绝非作秀
I guarantee you this is no stunt.

501
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,040
总统为解决这一危机采取了非常手段
The president is taking extraordinary measures to end this crisis.

502
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,240
总统先生  您请
Господин президент, пожалуйста.

503
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,630
总统先生
Mr. President.

504
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,380
你现在可以脱下防弹衣了  总统先生
You can take your vest off now, Mr. President.

505
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,430
-这里很安全  -你相信这些墙吗
- We're safe here. - You trust these walls?

506
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,310
你要是害怕  就不该来
If you're frightened, you shouldn't have come.

507
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,580
我在克格勃的时候  在阿富汗待了六个月
When I was in the KGB, I spent six months in Afghanistan.

508
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,290
这地方比起
This place is a palace

509
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,600
我当时待的地洞简直是宫殿
compared to the hole in the ground I lived in.

510
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,310
来  你得保持水分
Here. You should stay hydrated.

511
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,600
-我用飞机拉来了一箱水  -谢谢
- I brought a shipment of water in on my plane. - Thank you.

512
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,470
以色列还说要断我们的补给呢
So much for the Israelis stopping our resupply.

513
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,800
真希望我们能处在河谷更肥沃的地带
I wish we were in the fertile part of the valley, though.

514
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,360
听说有些地方绿意盎然  十分美丽
I hear it's quite green and beautiful.

515
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,460
这里更合适拍照嘛
Well, this is better for pictures.

516
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,290
什么意思
How do you mean?

517
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,580
如果你飞去个天堂般的地方
Well, if you flew into a paradise,

518
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,790
那就没什么效果了  是吧
wouldn't be as effective, now, would it?

519
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,760
你这人的确有表演天赋
You do have a flair for the theatrical.

520
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,690
我也可以这么说你
I can say the same about you,

521
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,990
这样跑到我家门口
showing up on my doorstep like this.

522
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,500
这不是你家门口
This isn't your doorstep.

523
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,180
你跑到你不该来的地方了
You're squatting where you shouldn't be.

524
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,240
我觉得我的手下可不会那么看
I don't think my men will see it like that.

525
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,910
你的手下可知道
Do your men know that

526
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,540
是你杀了他们的同志
you're responsible for killing their comrades?

527
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,180
指责
Accusations.

528
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,090
你就打算拿这个说服我吗
That's how you plan to convince me?

529
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,900
你要什么才肯撤军
What do you require to pull out of the valley?

530
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,570
你方军队也离开
That your troops leave as well,

531
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,030
结束整个维和行动
and the entire peacekeeping operation.

532
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,310
只要俄军一撤离
Well, as soon as your troops withdraw,

533
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,070
我一定让联合国军队也撤走
I'll make sure the UN forces do exactly the same.

534
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,000
你还得削减导弹防御
And you scale back missile defense.

535
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,120
就像我们之前曾两次说好的那样
As we agreed to twice already.

536
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,210
当时我们的谈判可完全不同
That's when we were making an entirely different deal.

537
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,430
现在最大的区别是
The main difference now

538
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,800
如今我们都在沙漠里
is that we're both standing in the desert,

539
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,460
而你不能只带着一鞋底的沙子出去
and you can't leave with nothing to show but sand in your shoes.

540
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,240
我同意削减防御  跟之前的条件一样
I'll agree to the scale-back. Same terms as before.

541
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,350
你多快能开始撤军
How soon can you mobilize a withdrawal?

542
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,610
联合国军队一撤  我们也会撤的
Well, the moment UN forces begin to pull out, we will do the same.

543
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,720
我已让五角大楼
I've had the Pentagon

544
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,180
制定了一个最早明天就能执行的
come up with an exit plan that we can put into effect

545
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,720
撤退计划  至于其他联合国军队
as early as tomorrow. As for the rest of the UN forces,

546
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,330
我可以马上联系联合国秘书长
I can reach out to the Secretary General immediately.

547
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,560
你  还是你妻子
You or... your wife?

548
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,360
当然  她大概会代表我去打电话
Well, yes, she would probably make the call on my behalf.

549
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,870
我觉得还是不要了
I don't think she should.

550
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,590
你想让我打电话吗
You think I should make the call?

551
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,280
不止如此
More than that.

552
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,780
我觉得她该走人
I think she should be gone.

553
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,150
什么意思  不再参加谈判吗
Gone in what way? Gone from these negotiations?

554
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,290
不再做大使
As ambassador.

555
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,280
这是我最后的条件
My final condition.

556
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,330
这不能拿来商量
That cannot be on the table.

557
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,600
能  而且没得商量
It is. And it's non-negotiable.

558
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,910
邓普西女士  我是丽萨的朋友
Ms. Dempsey. I'm a friend of Lisa's.

559
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,070
-麦克斯  -对
- Uh, Max? - That's right.

560
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,020
她叫我告诉你  她要晚一会儿
Yes, she told me to tell you she's running a few minutes behind.

561
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,440
好  那我在外面等  谢谢
Okay, I'll just wait outside. Thank you.

562
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,010
不  外面太冷
No, it's... chilly.

563
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,610
进来去她房间吧
You can come on up to her room.

564
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,020
好
Okay.

565
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,800
我只想说  我很遗憾
I just want you to know... I'm so sorry.

566
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,480
丽萨告诉我们了  我们都为你祈祷
Lisa told us and our prayers are with you.

567
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,620
太感谢了
Thank you so much.

568
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,360
她说您和丈夫就像她父母  的确不难看出
She said you and your husband  were like parents to her. I see why.

569
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,530
请进
Come on in.

570
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,300
麦克斯
Max, hey.

571
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,490
抱歉我迟了
Sorry I'm late.

572
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,570
给  拿回去吧
Here, I want you to take that back.

573
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,060
不不  这钱是给你的
No, no, no, that money's yours.

574
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,480
不  我不能接受
No, I can't. I can't take it.

575
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,370
团契的人一起凑的
Everyone at the fellowship pitched in.

576
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,710
-还给他们吧  -我不能
- Just give it back to 'em. - I can't.

577
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,840
你说你需要钱买药的
You said that you needed the money for the medicine.

578
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,610
坐下吧
Yeah, sit down.

579
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,990
抱歉  请坐
Sorry, please.

580
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,090
好吧
Okay.

581
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,590
我要跟你说的事  听上去会很糟糕
What I'm about to tell you is gonna sound fucked up,

582
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,390
但你说什么之前  先听我说完  好吗
but just hear me out before you say anything, all right?

583
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,650
好
Okay.

584
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,440
我要走了
I'm leaving.

585
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,130
再也不回来了
And I'm not coming back.

586
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,580
我要走  是因为我有危险
And... I have to leave because I'm in danger.

587
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,720
我不叫麦克斯
My name isn't Max.

588
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,710
我也没有艾滋
I don't have AIDS.

589
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,490
-等等  -听我说完  拜托了
- Wait. Hold on. - Let me finish, please.

590
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,620
我想向你解释一切  但我不能
I want to explain everything to you, but I can't.

591
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,990
你知道得越少越好
The less you know, the better.

592
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,840
但听我说
But listen to me.

593
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,470
如果联调局找来  你什么都不能说
If the FBI comes here, you can't say anything.

594
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,080
你得告诉他们你不认识我
You have to tell them you don't know me.

595
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,960
-联调局  -对  如果他们找来
- The FBI? - Yes, and if they do,

596
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,540
你去联系这个人  他叫道格·斯坦普
I want you to contact this man. His name is Doug Stamper.

597
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,690
-他能帮你  -麦克斯  这太疯狂了
- And he can help you. - Max. This is crazy.

598
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,700
那不是我的名字
It's not my name.

599
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,180
是我编的  我编造了一切
I made it up. I made up everything.

600
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,140
名字  女友  诊所
The name, the girlfriend, the clinic.

601
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,490
不  我也去了
No, I was there with you.

602
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,790
我装的  我没办法
I faked it. I had to.

603
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,190
如果你不是麦克斯  你是谁
If you're not Max... then who are you?

604
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,180
拿着  他会帮你
Take this. He will help you.

605
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,160
他能保护你
He can protect you.

606
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,660
求你  我知道这不公平
Please. I know it's not fair.

607
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,460
-你走吧  -你得收下这个
- Please leave. - Let me leave this with you.

608
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,940
我跟这一切毫无关系
I don't want to have anything to do with it.

609
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,250
你拿走吧
Please, just take it with you.

610
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,050
你走吧
Please leave.

611
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,220
你是个好人  丽萨
You're a good person, Lisa.

612
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,920
但我不是
I'm just not.

613
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,140
很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

614
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,520
除了她  我还能给你什么
What can I offer you instead of her?

615
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,530
没了
Nothing.

616
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,140
人道主义救济金呢
What about a humanitarian relief fund,

617
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,330
给你在非洲的盟友
for your allies in Africa?

618
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,550
你可以随意使用
You can distribute it any way you see fit.

619
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,970
几十亿美元吗  我没那么好收买
A few billion dollars? I'm not that easily bought.

620
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,500
那我们重新考虑伊兹密尔的基地呢
All right, let's say that we re-examine our base in Izmir.

621
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,760
国会不会允许的
Congress would never let you.

622
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,750
而且现实点说
And realistically,

623
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,080
你愿意拿重要战略性空港
you're willing to barter major strategic airfields

624
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,480
交换你妻子吗
on account of your wife?

625
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,990
你不能把这事扯到她身上
You can't make this about her.

626
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,150
她本来就没资格做大使
She was never equipped to be an ambassador.

627
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,230
你很清楚
You know that.

628
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,620
我理解
I understand.

629
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,880
你怎么能拒绝自己的妻子呢
How could you say no to your own wife?

630
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,590
但她让你蒙蔽了双眼
But she's blinding you.

631
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,430
-我是在帮你忙  -你这是小心眼
- I'm doing you a favor. - You are being petty.

632
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,600
你派去的海豹突击队
The SEAL team you sent.

633
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,180
看我们多容易就耍了她
Look how easily we manipulated her.

634
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,720
莫里科夫都没怎么下功夫
Moryakov didn't have to work too hard.

635
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,430
我们是不是炸死了自家战士
Did we blow up our own men?

636
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,890
或许吧
Maybe we did.

637
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,830
或许没有
Maybe we didn't.

638
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,460
但我们让她以为我们做了
But we made her believe that we did.

639
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,720
而她说服了你
And she convinced you.

640
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,040
这不叫被蒙蔽吗
Now, wouldn't you call that blindness?

641
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,830
你现在想杀了我  我看得出
You want to kill me now. I can see it.

642
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,250
我读过一篇有趣的文章
I read an amusing article about, um...

643
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,300
一个内战情景重现演员
a Civil War re-enactor,

644
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,920
他说你的曾曾祖父
who said that your great-great-grandfather

645
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,030
赤手杀了一名北方兵
killed a Yankee soldier with his bare hands.

646
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,690
我在阿富汗时  我们被圣战组织偷袭了
When I was in Afghanistan, we were ambushed by the Mujahideen.

647
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,600
那个打中我这里和这里的人
And the man who shot me here and here,

648
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,850
他的枪卡住后  还刺了我一刀
he stabbed me when his rifle jammed.

649
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,230
我把刀拔了出来  割了他的喉
I pulled the knife away and slit his throat.

650
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,020
知道  这故事你跟媒体说过十多次了
Yes, I know, you've told that story dozens of times to the press.

651
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,400
但我没说的是
The part I don't tell is

652
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,900
我割了他喉咙之后  我并没停下
that after I slit his throat, I kept going.

653
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,830
我们把他的头绑在一头驴上
We strapped his head to a donkey

654
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,270
让驴把他的头带回他的村子
so it would carry it back to his village.

655
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,500
我赤手空拳杀过人
I've killed a man with my bare hands.

656
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,600
那不是故事
It wasn't make-believe.

657
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,300
你觉得你能做到吗
Do you think you're capable?

658
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,090
我觉得你能
I think you are.

659
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,100
你无情
You're ruthless.

660
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,810
跟我一样
Like me.

661
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,190
有时候对恨我们的人  我们必须无情
Sometimes we must be ruthless with those who hate us.

662
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,810
有时候对我们爱的人  也要无情
And sometimes we must be ruthless with those we love.

663
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,600
我不明白你为什么那么在乎克莱尔
I don't see why Claire means so much to you.

664
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,100
因为你非常在乎她
Because she means so much to you.

665
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,380
你如果答应  我就知道你是真心的
And if you do this, I will know you're serious.

666
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,880
您妻子打来了  先生
Your wife is on the line, sir.

667
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,340
告诉她我再回电
Tell her I'll call her back.

668
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,760
我已经说两次了
I've told her that twice now.

669
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,590
-再说  -是  先生
- Tell her again. - Yes, sir.

670
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,440
你不用洗的  萨拉
You don't have to do that, Sarah.

671
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,570
没事  不费事的
I don't mind. It doesn't take long.

672
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,500
没事  我们洗吧  你去放松
No, no. Let us do it. You go relax.

673
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,540
我待会儿就抱俩小坏蛋上床
I'll move the monsters in a few minutes.

674
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,590
-好  -好
- Okay. - All right.

675
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,800
床上见
See you in bed.

676
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,260
明天见
See you tomorrow.

677
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,520
真希望我能睡那么香
I wish I could sleep like that.

678
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,550
你考虑过成家吗
You ever think of settling down?

679
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,650
自己也生俩孩子
Gettin' a couple of these for yourself?

680
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,390
从没想过
Hasn't ever crossed my mind.

681
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,170
从没
Never?

682
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,040
这不适合我  这种生活
It's not for me. A life like that.

683
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,300
我这种生活吗
You mean a life like mine?

684
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,350
-我没那么说  -我知道你一直这么想
- That's not what I said. - I know you've always felt that way.

685
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:49,570
房贷  朝九晚五  妻子  俩孩子  一条狗
A mortgage, nine to five, wife, two kids, a dog.

686
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,360
不是
No.

687
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,720
我就是重视自由
It's just my freedom's important to me.

688
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,570
我比你自由多了  伙计
I'm freer than you are, pal.

689
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,640
我待在哥伦布是因为喜欢
I stayed in Columbus because I liked it,

690
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,590
又不是有谁逼我
not because anybody made me.

691
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,530
我选择了扎根
I chose to put down roots.

692
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,510
而你一直在逃避
You've always been running from something.

693
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,530
我可没对你指手画脚  你也别来说我
Hey, I don't judge you. Don't judge me.

694
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,570
就听你哥哥说一句
Listen to your big brother for a second.

695
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,760
不  我现在最不需要的就是教训
No, last thing I need is a lecture right now.

696
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,640
你整个恢复期间
During your whole recovery,

697
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,700
一直说着要回去工作
all you kept talking about was getting back to work.

698
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,110
我来了一个月
Over a month I've been here,

699
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,290
用我自己的假期  还请了假
using all my vacation time and then some.

700
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,190
你如果不想来  那就回家啊
If you don't want to be here, then maybe you should go home.

701
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,620
不是为这个  道格
It's not about that, Doug.

702
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,870
我来是因为你是我的亲人
I'm here because you're family.

703
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,380
因为你比工作更重要
Because you're more important than work.

704
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,650
我要是因为你丢了工作  我就另找个
If I lost my job because of you, I'd find another one.

705
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,560
你有什么
What do you have?

706
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,720
弗兰克·安德伍德吗  这你都没有
Frank Underwood? You don't even have that.

707
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,720
你冰箱上有两张照片
You got two pictures on your fridge,

708
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,140
还是我的孩子
and they're of my kids.

709
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,480
这不叫自由
That's not freedom.

710
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,810
佩特罗夫要求外交人事变动
Petrov wants a diplomatic change.

711
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,030
联合国的人事
At the UN.

712
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,240
-我  -没得商量
- Me. - It was non-negotiable.

713
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,830
你显然没有拒绝
Clearly, you didn't say no.

714
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,390
我想先跟你商量
I wanted to discuss it with you first.

715
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,290
我打了好几次
I called more than once.

716
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,710
我想说服自己拒绝他
I wanted to convince myself to refuse what he asked.

717
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,230
但我做不到
But... I couldn't do that.

718
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,740
我就说你去是在犯错  弗兰西斯
I told you it was a mistake to go, Francis.

719
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,740
决议案也是错呢  科里根也是个错误
And the resolution was a mistake. And Corrigan was a mistake.

720
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,040
我们可以一个个细数错误  但情况就是这样
We could tally up all our mistakes, but we are where we are.

721
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,700
我现在得专心解决眼前的问题
I need to concentrate on what's in front of me right now.

722
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,150
我  我就在你眼前
I am. I'm in front of you.

723
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,750
俄国必须撤军  就这么简单
The Russians need to leave. It's as simple as that.

724
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,970
你要我说这样没事
You want me to say this is okay.

725
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,860
不
No.

726
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,480
弗兰西斯  我更希望
Francis, I would've preferred

727
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,830
你直接走进来  告诉我我被解雇了
if you had walked in and just told me I was fired.

728
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,890
他们耍了你  克莱尔
They played you, Claire.

729
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,370
莫里科夫根本不是良心发现
Moryakov was not having some crisis of conscience.

730
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:28,010
全是为了骗我们派海豹突击队去
It was all so that we would send our SEAL team in.

731
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,810
好让我们激怒以色列
So that we would provoke the Israelis.

732
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,620
我没看出来  因为我太信任你了
And I didn't see it, because I trusted you too much.

733
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,920
我没能客观地思考
I didn't look at it objectively...

734
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,140
因为你是我妻子
because you're my wife.

735
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,950
-佩特罗夫说的  -是

736
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,800
-你相信他  -是的

737
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,350
我会辞职

738
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,160
真希望不用走到这一步
I wish it didn't have to come to this.

739
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,200
我们怎么跟媒体说
What do we say to the press?

740
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,280
你想专注于竞选
That you want to focus on the campaign,

741
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,130
本来就如此打算
that that was your plan all along.

742
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,850
但我想先看到危机解决

743
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,460
没人会质疑的

744
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,860
告诉佩特罗夫
Tell Petrov.

745
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,090
我会
And I will...

746
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,450
在你需要的时候宣布

747
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,160

748
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:30,330
你说得对  我不该去
You were right. I shouldn't have gone.

749
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,090
那是你该做的决定  不是我

750

晚安
Good night.

751
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,760
我的决定
My decision.

752
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,450
有时候我觉得总统之位
Sometimes I think the presidency...

753
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,090
是有选择的假象
is the illusion of choice.

754
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,320
怎么了
What is it?

755
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,050
我得去白宫
I have to go to the White House.

756
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,490
这大半夜的
It's the middle of the night.

我吵醒你了

761
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,930
没事
It's fine.

762
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,120
反正我睡觉不实
I'm a light sleeper anyway.

763
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,800
就算不是你  警笛  垃圾车也能吵醒我
If it wasn't you, it would've been a siren or a dump truck.

764
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,550
我经常大半夜被吵醒
I get woken up in the middle of the night all the time.

765

世界什么地方出现危机了

766
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,440
战况室
Some... situation...

767

出现了什么情况
in the Situation Room.

768
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,290
比垃圾车好多了
Well, that's better than a dump truck.

769
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,510
你去找了蒂姆·科贝特
You reached out to Tim Corbet.

770
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,150
是啊
I did.

771
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,160
我几天前跟他通了话
I spoke to him a few days ago.

772
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,890
他专程打来通知我
He called to let me know.

773
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,010
那么你俩很亲密了
So you two are still close.

774
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,600
现在不是了
Not anymore.

775
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,530
在学校时是很亲密
At school we were.

776
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,280
我觉得他可能知道你当时是什么样子
I thought he might have some insight to how you were back then.

777
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,530
渐渐成熟起来的时期
Those are formative years.

778
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,700
可能对你更有价值
More formative for you than for me.

779
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,720
我也就是学会了走正步和开枪
I learned how to march and shoot a gun, that's about it.

780
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,440
我要是去了军事学院的确会更好
I would've been better off in military school.

781
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,750
是吗  为什么
Yeah? Why's that?

782
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:21,480
还不到合法喝酒的年纪  就从男妓
You go from turning tricks to being on the bestseller list

783
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,300
一跃成为畅销书作家  这对人没好处
before you can legally drink, it messes with you.

784
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,750
你告诉我是你朋友...
You told me your friend was the one who, uh...

785
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,480
我撒谎了
I lied.

00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,620
为什么  觉得耻辱吗

787

我第一次那么做  简直吓死了
First time I did it, I was scared out of my mind.

788
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,440
我敲门  门开了
I knock on the door, it opens...

789
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,380
那人穿了缎子睡袍

790
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,190
他很胖

头发粘粘的  梳过来盖住了秃顶的地方
Stringy hair, combed over his bald spot.

792
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,240
脸上汗如雨下

793
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,030
我差点掉头跑回电梯了
I almost ran back to the elevator.

794
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,920
但你没有
But you didn't.

796
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,710
我需要钱

车祸
Car accident.

800
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,480
他说他们本打算春天去东京玩

801

00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,030
有时候只是性

809
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,420
但更多时候不是的
But a lot of times, it wasn't.

00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,070
他们什么都告诉我
They would tell me everything.

811
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,380
这些人

812

那种窥视

让人上瘾

我不是作为你的传记作者问你

我们找了两个焦点小组做调查

我更喜欢深色

867
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,700
你不用解释  宣布辞职后
You don't have to explain. We'll do the color change

868
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,400

872
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,030
提不提名  不会靠你的头发

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}奥巴马刚刚就任不久  就在讲话中对巴勒斯坦流露出许多同情
令盟友以色列政府大为光火
2011年  由于不满奥巴马的讲话  到华盛顿访问的以色列总理内塔尼亚胡
在记者面前对奥巴马很不客气  大段大段地讲述中东历史
把美国总统当作小学生一般
随后在G20峰会上  奥巴马同法国总统萨科齐
私下抱怨内塔尼亚胡的言论意外曝光
记者听到萨科齐指责内塔尼亚胡是"说谎者"
而奥巴马则无奈地回答
"你受够了他  可我还不得不每天跟他打交道"
这段对话曝光后  奥巴马同内塔尼亚胡的关系更是跌至冰点

878
00:54:43,920 --> 00:55:08,920
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}最近一段时间  由于以色列反对白宫同伊朗正在进行的谈判
美以关系愈发紧张
今年年初  内塔尼亚胡接受众议院议长博纳的邀请到美国国会发表演讲
但是由于这个安排事先没有知会白宫  令奥巴马大为光火
遂以"不在外国领导人选举前举行国事会见"为由
拒绝在内塔尼亚胡来访时同他会面
同时在白宫的支持下
国会大批民主党议员也借故决定不出席内塔尼亚胡的演讲
白宫也把副总统拜登和国务卿克里安排到国外访问
这样内塔尼亚胡3月初到访美国时
只能去国会山给半个国会做个演讲
白宫却要把他拒之门外
