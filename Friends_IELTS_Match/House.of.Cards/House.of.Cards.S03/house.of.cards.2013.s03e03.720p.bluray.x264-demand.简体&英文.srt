00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,600
我们这就叫自由集会
This is what the freedom to assemble looks like!

32
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,860
停止操纵媒体
Stop silencing the press!

33
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,410
停止迫害异己
Stop persecuting the opposition!

34
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
停止关押同性恋人士
Stop imprisoning people simply because they're gay!

35
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,970
你是在毁掉俄罗斯的未来
You're destroying Russia's future!

36
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,550
佩特罗夫的车队来了之后
When Petrov's motorcade arrives,

37
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,750
让军乐队使劲大声演奏
have the band already playing as loud as they can.

38
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,960
我跟上校说一下
I'll speak to the Colonel.

39
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,270
-暴动小猫的姑娘呢  -我亲自跟她们交待了
- What about the Pussy Riot girls? - I briefed them myself.

40
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,450
她们希望你跟佩特罗夫谈这些问题
Here's a list of the issues they want you to discuss with Petrov.

41
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,030
-一切就绪了  -告诉她们我谈了
- We're good to go. - Tell them I did.

42
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,820
请她们共进晚餐真的好吗
Sure it's a good idea to have them at the dinner?

43
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,240
多聪明  她们是异见分子
It's a smart idea. They're dissidents.

44
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,010
肯定会让佩特罗夫头疼
They've been nothing but a pain in Petrov's ass.

45
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,940
他想拍张照就收买她们吗  可以啊
He wants to co-opt them with a photo? Fine.

46
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,890
对他重要的  对我也重要
If it's important to him, it's important to me.

47
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,660
-鲍勃  -总统先生
- Bob. - Mr. President.

48
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,680
得尽快把修正案敲定好
We have to get these amendments out of committee.

49
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,430
把《美就法》递交国会
Get AmWorks on the floor.

50
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,910
也许能通过一两个  七个不可能全过
We might be able to squeeze a couple through, but not all seven.

51
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,250
那就调整资金来源
Then restructure the funding.

52
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,200
一个委员会只递交一份修正案
Shoot for one amendment in one committee.

53
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,230
找财政委员会试试
Try Ways and Means.

54
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,290
一下子申请全款  共和党肯定不同意
The Republicans will never go for a lump sum.

55
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,320
得根据各个委员会职责分割法案
We have to split it up into jurisdictional parts.

56
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,820
我宣布《美国就业法案》时
When I announced America Works,

57
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,140
承诺了一千万就业岗位
I promised ten million jobs.

58
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,010
是不是该降低一下期望
Maybe it's time to lower expectations.

59
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,980
-不行  听我...  -抱歉  先生
- No, look-- - Pardon me, sir.

60
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,310
佩特罗夫总统的车队还有15分钟到
President Petrov's motorcade is 15 out.

61
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,840
-谢谢  -你去吧
- Thank you. - I'll let you go.

62
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,910
鲍勃  还有几分钟  先坐下
Bob, we have a few more minutes. Please sit down.

63
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,290
你今天的事够多了
You have a lot on your plate today.

64
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,430
不如今晚的国宴上接着谈吧
Why don't we pick it up tonight at the state dinner?

65
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,400
很期待呢  总统先生
Looking forward to it, Mr. President.

66
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,610
懦夫的脸什么样
What is the face of a coward?

67
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
临阵脱逃了  只能看得见后脑勺
The back of his head as he runs from the battle.

68
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,280
-欢迎  总统先生  -谢谢  总统先生
- Welcome, Mr. President. - Thank you, Mr. President.

69
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,930
第一次来白宫吗
This is your first visit to the White House?

70
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,240
是啊  但你是我经历过的第三任总统了
Yes, yes. But my third president.

71
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,930
我看过你对约旦河谷的提议了
I have reviewed your proposal for the Jordan Valley.

72
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,850
不错
Impressive.

73
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,630
你喜欢吗
So you liked the proposal?

74
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,120
不行
The answer is no.

75
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,600
我不是开玩笑  总统先生
It's not a joke, Mr. President.

76
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,660
我对你的计划没有任何兴趣
I have no interest whatsoever in pursuing your plan.

77
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,430
约旦河谷只是树木  我们不能不见森林
The Jordan Valley is the trees instead of the forest.

78
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,680
而这个双边政策  是在疏远我们
And this bilateral approach, it's... alienating.

79
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,130
我跟卡斯皮女士并不总能达成一致
I don't often see eye to eye with Ms. Caspi,

80
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,970
但你们似乎是在要求巴勒斯坦
but it does feel like you're asking the state of Palestine

81
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,790
支持一项我们不能参与商议制定的计划
to support a plan without having a seat at the table.

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,270
我们的目标是软化俄罗斯
Well, our goal is to soften Russia,

83
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,260
先让他们作为合作伙伴加入
to bring them in as a partner first--

84
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,060
如果能说服俄国组建联合部队
If we can get the Russians to agree to a joint force,

85
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,300
一起监控约旦河谷  他们会加入的
monitor the valley together, then they're invested.

86
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,410
之后他们就不会阻碍我们...
They won't be a thorn in our side when we move forward--

87
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,290
我们能指望俄罗斯吗
How can we count on the Russians?

88
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,680
你丈夫真认为佩特罗夫信得过吗
Does your husband truly believe he can trust Petrov?

89
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,980
总统很乐观
The president is optimistic.

90
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,600
我们只希望你们愿意考虑
All we ask is that you remain open-minded.

91
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,820
希望你把
I hope you'll convey our

92
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,160
我们的不满直接传达给你丈夫
dissatisfaction directly to your husband.

93
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,200
我一定转达你们的担忧
I'll be sure to share your concerns.

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,230
安德伍德大使会跟你们保持联络的
Ambassador Underwood will remain in contact with both of you.

95
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,920
之前不该插你的话
I shouldn't have interrupted you earlier.

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,040
会面时  太不应该了
In the meeting. It was out of place,

97
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,230
我该让你说的
and I should have let you do all the talking.

98
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,200
没事的
It's fine.

99
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,380
我知道你对我有怀疑
I know you have doubts about me.

100
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,080
休会任命的事  我们还没谈过
The recess appointment. We haven't discussed it.

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,290
-应该谈谈的  -真的没必要
- And we should. - It really isn't necessary.

102
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,490
这的确不合常规
It is an unorthodox dynamic, yes.

103
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,830
你也总归是第一夫人
You will always be the First Lady.

104
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,800
这也是你的飞机  但我们能处理好
This is your plane, after all. But we can work around that.

105
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,270
我知道  但我想告诉你...
Yes, I know, but I want you to know that--

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,950
安德伍德夫人  总统来电
Mrs. Underwood, the president is on the line.

107
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,790
怎么样
How'd it go?

108
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,870
-要接通凯茜吗  -不  直接跟我说
- Should we conference Cathy in? - No, just tell me.

109
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,980
有很对反对  他们不满意
A lot of pushback. They aren't happy.

110
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,090
等时机成熟  他们就会同意
Well, they'll get on board when the time comes.

111
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,330
-你那边怎么样  -他说不
- What about you? - He said no.

112
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,970
-这是他嘴里冒出的第一个字  -全盘拒绝吗
- First word out of his mouth. - No to everything?

113
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,560
他可能只是玩心理战
Oh, he might just be playing mind games,

114
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,900
让我自乱脚
trying to throw me off balance,

115
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,600
但他毕竟是克格勃出身
but this is a guy who was brought up through the KGB, after all.

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,780
你和凯茜出手得温柔点
We're gonna have to have you and Cathy use the light touch.

117
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,970
我们得软磨硬泡
We need to massage this.

118
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,440
我们接通凯茜吧
Let's include her in this phone call.

119
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,320
不  你直接告诉她  我马上要会面了
No, just tell her. I have to go in soon.

120
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,180
不直接告诉她很不好
It's important we don't bypass her.

121
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,050
好像我们有意不跟她通气  弗兰西斯
If it looks like we're leaving her out of the loop, Francis...

122
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,270
行  接通她
All right, put her on.

123
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,430
我无法形容这对我们团队是多么重要
I can't tell you how much it would mean to the team.

124
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,490
能有您这样履历的专业人士加入
To have your qualifications, your expertise on board.

125
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,710
光是把您的名字摆在网页上就够风光了
Even just having your name on the website.

126
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,700
很感激您这么说  议员先生
I appreciate your saying that, Congressman.

127
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,640
请叫我布拉德  实习生才叫我议员先生
Brad. Please. Congressman's what the interns call me.

128
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,350
行  就叫布拉德
All right. Brad it is.

129
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,310
至于您的头衔  特别顾问行吗
Now as for your title, I was thinking Special Advisor?

130
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,700
-头衔不重要  -随您怎么叫
- Title doesn't matter to me. - You pick what you want.

131
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,360
工作时间您说了算  想来就来  想走就走
And you make your own hours. Come and go as you like.

132
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,620
22万美元一年怎么样
Uh, compensation, would 220 a year work for you?

133
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,720
上限是17.3万
The cap is 173.

134
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,490
另外五万从我的改选资金里拨
Well, the extra 50K would come out of my re-election fund.

135
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,800
只拿最高工资不是亏待了您
I mean, you deserve more than the cap.

136
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,960
您的提议很慷慨
That's a very generous offer.

137
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,220
希望您能付出等价努力
Well, I expect you to earn it.

138
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,960
这次竞选我很想有所作为
I really want to make my mark this session.

139
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,260
-比安德伍德付的还多  -什么
- That's more than Underwood paid me. - I'm sorry?

140
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,270
我当他的幕僚长时  拿最高工资  
When I was his chief of staff, I made the cap.

141
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,650
他给的远不到22万
He never came anywhere near 220.

142
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,810
我说过  我觉得您该...
Well, like I said, I think you deserve--

143
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,470
工资太高了  议员先生
It's too much money, Congressman.

144
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,500
我不觉得  但是
Well, I disagree, but,

145
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,900
您想拿少点我不反对
hey, I'm not gonna argue if you want to get paid less.

146
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,450
我说了  这份运输法案
As I was saying, this transpo bill,

147
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,830
能产生很大的影响
we really have an opportunity to make a difference.

148
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,490
女士们  先生们  会面结束
Ladies and gentlemen, the session is over.

149
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,350
请往这边走  谢谢前来
Please, right this way. Thank you for coming.

150
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,290
我听说您最近开始冲浪了
I hear you've recently taken up surfing.

151
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,970
黑海那边有几个地方不错
We have a few spots on the Black Sea.

152
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,050
主要是我能摆姿势拍照
It's mostly so I can pose for the photos.

153
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,590
是  我看到照片了
Yes, I've seen them.

154
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,870
年轻人喜欢
It plays well with the young people.

155
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,630
让他们看到自己的总统有点乐趣很重要
It's important they see their president has some fun,

156
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,460
不会把自己搞得太严肃
doesn't take himself too seriously.

157
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,790
我给你准备了份礼物
I have a gift for you.

158
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,390
抱歉来晚了
I'm sorry for the delay.

159
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,120
希望没让你们等太久
I hope we didn't keep you waiting too long.

160
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,880
可以开始了吗
Shall we?

161
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,790
这是托马斯·吴亲手做的  很有才的美国手艺人
This was handmade by Tomas Vu, a very talented American artist.

162
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,700
一面用激光刻了画  另一面
He laser-etches images on one side, and on the other side...

163
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,320
是披头士的歌词
he puts Beatles lyrics.

164
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,130
回到苏联时期了
Back in the USSR.

165
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,740
这是博物馆藏品  但你还是能用它冲浪
It's a museum piece, but you can still ride it.

166
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,250
你什么时候来我索契的乡间别墅吧
You should come out to my dacha in Sochi sometime.

167
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,610
我们可以一起冲浪
We'll surf together.

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,210
水冷得刺骨  但当地女人很热情
The water is cold as hell, but... the women are very warm.

169
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,460
克莱尔怕是不会乐意
Oh, I'm not sure what Claire would think about that.

170
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,540
带她一起
Well, bring her along.

171
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,170
那里有很多艺术家
It's crawling with artists out there.

172
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,000
说不定她能找到喜欢的
She might find something she likes.

173
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,900
总统先生  我很好奇
Mr. President, I'm intrigued.

174
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,890
你一到美国对我说的第一个字就是"不"
The first thing you say to me is "No" the second you arrive,

175
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,130
紧接着又邀请我去你的乡间别墅
and the next moment you're inviting me to your dacha.

176
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,110
你到底是个什么样的人
Who am I dealing with?

177
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,640
我刚来就说清楚了  你有什么疑惑
I believe I was clear when we first met. What confuses you?

178
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,160
我们的代表团谈这些事谈了好几个月
Our delegations have been discussing these issues for months.

179
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,670
没错  但谈不代表达成一致
Yes, but discussions are not the same as commitment.

180
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,980
我现在告诉你
And, uh, I'm telling you now.

181
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,410
我们不会达成一致
There will be no commitment.

182
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,940
这你打电话就能告诉我了
You could've told me that on the phone.

183
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,130
我以为你邀我来是想弥补对我的侮辱
I assumed you were undoing an insult by having me here.

184
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,840
什么侮辱
What insult is that?

185
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,790
你的前两任都没邀请我来过华盛顿
Two of your predecessors never invited me to Washington.

186
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,030
这次峰会不是走过场
This summit is not just for show.

187
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,480
我希望能朝着和平的目标迈出一大步
I want to make meaningful strides toward peace.

188
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,460
历史告诉我们  中东地区是没救了
The Middle East is hopeless. History tells us that.

189
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,040
我是在给你创造历史的机会
I'm offering you the chance to make history.

190
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,170
我就跟你说实话了
I'll be honest with you,

191
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,590
毕竟你好心好意请我来
because you've been kind enough to invite me to your country.

192
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,930
中东和平  对俄罗斯毫无利益可言
Russia has nothing to gain from peace in the Middle East.

193
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,300
更重要的是  和美国合作也毫无利益
And more importantly, nothing to gain from working with America.

194
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,030
以色列一向不信任我们
Israel has always distrusted us.

195
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,490
你指望这有所改变吗
You expect that to change?

196
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,780
我们希望能慢慢建立信任
We expect to build trust over time.

197
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,840
你们今早和大使们的会面怎么样
How was your meeting with the ambassadors this morning?

198
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,900
阿鲁里大使给我打电话了
Ambassador Aruri called me.

199
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,920
他们有疑虑
They have their doubts,

200
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,190
但我们希望他们能愿意考虑
but we encouraged them to keep an open mind.

201
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,760
他说他十分担忧
He described it as grave concerns.

202
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,580
等我们确定了他们自然会适应...
They will acclimate as soon as we establish--

203
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,210
你丈夫直接向以色列和巴勒斯坦提议了吗
Has your husband made direct overtures to Israel and Palestine?

204
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,060
所有正式通讯
All formal communication

205
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,070
都经由国务院处理
has been handled through the State Department.

206
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,360
但你丈夫不可能认为他们会顺从吧
But your husband can't possibly believe they'll comply.

207
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,090
先生们  为了让谈话进行下去
Gentlemen, for the purposes of these talks,

208
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,260
请你们叫他总统
I'd appreciate it if you refer to him as the president,

209
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,670
而不是"我丈夫"
not as my husband.

210
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,390
当然  大使女士
Of course, Madam Ambassador.

211
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,510
而且你该向杜兰特国务卿发问
And you really should be addressing Secretary Durant.

212
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,280
她比我更能代表总统的意见
She speaks on his behalf more than I do.

213
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,820
抱歉  国务卿女士  请继续吧
Our apologies, Madam Secretary. Please, continue.

214
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,260
我们想把细节梳理完  请翻到12页
We'd like to finish reviewing the specifics, so page 12, please.

215
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,690
总统先生  我们已经在多个方面展开了合作
Mr. President, we're already working together on several fronts:

216
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,780
防核扩散协议  打击恐怖主义  朝鲜
nonproliferation, the War on Terror, North Korea.

217
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,360
为什么中东就偏偏不行呢
I don't see any reason that the Middle East should be any different.

218
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,760
-因为这是美国的计划  -不是那样
- Because it's an American plan. - It's not an American plan.

219
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,290
-我保证条件平等  -保证
- I'm promising equal terms. - Oh, promises.

220
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,010
{\pos(382,284)}{\an3}1978年在戴维营军事基地
卡特总统促成埃及与以色列之间
签署了《戴维营协议》

221
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,740
卡特总统保证双方平等参与
Carter promised equal involvement,

222
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,010
最后签协议的时候却没叫我们
then shut us out of Camp David.

223
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,600
波斯尼亚战争  克林顿也是如此
Clinton did the same with Bosnia.

224
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,710
现在我是总统
I'm the president now.

225
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,140
这次不会那样了
That won't happen this time.

226
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,820
直到18个月之后  你下台
Until 18 months from now, when you are replaced.

227
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,730
我很嫉妒  维克多
I'm jealous, Viktor.

228
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,910
你不用向任何人汇报  没有任何对手
You don't answer to anyone. You have no real opposition.

229
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,970
你也知道大选结果会怎么样
You know exactly how every election is gonna turn out.

230
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,780
美国可不是这样
Well, it's not like that in the United States.

231
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,540
我不竞选  是因为我
I'm not running because I can

232
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,990
能做到总统候选人做不到的事  比如这份提议
do things a candidate can't do, like this proposal.

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,560
得了吧  总统先生  你我都知道你会参选的
Please, Mr. President, we both know you'll run.

234
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,450
不过能不能赢  谁知道呢
Now, whether you win... Who knows?

235
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,440
直说吧  你究竟想要什么
Brass tacks. If you could have anything, what would it be?

236
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,020
我没什么想要的
I came with nothing to ask.

237
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,620
你这种人如果没有胃口  是不会赴宴的
Men like you don't show up for dinner without an appetite.

238
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,100
我旅途劳顿  总统先生
It was a long flight, Mr. President.

239
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,740
先谈到这儿吧
How about we stop here for now.

240
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,910
我休息休息眼睛
I rest my eyes a bit and

241
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,080
等精神好点再想想这个提案
put some thought into this with a fresh mind.

242
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,930
没准能想出我要什么
Maybe I'll... think of something I want.

243
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,460
等晚宴的时候再谈
We'll talk more later, at dinner.

244
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,260
可以啊  如果你想这样
Of course, if that's what you prefer.

245
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,050
他知道自己要什么  就是要别人求他
He knows exactly what he wants, but he needs to be wooed.

246
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,580
不过也算有进展
Progress, nonetheless.

247
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,850
不经过"也许"  是没法把"不"变成"好"的
You can't turn a "No" to a "Yes" without a "maybe" in between.

248
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,730
先生们
Gentlemen...

249
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,260
副局长来了
Deputy Director coming through.

250
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,880
奥尔西  跟我来
Orsay? Come with me, please.

251
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,950
我们抓到亚设了
We got Asher.

252
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,770
凌晨两点半  他要吓死了
Two-thirty this morning. He was scared to death.

253
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,400
15分钟之后  他给了我们6TB的压缩文件
By 2:45, he gave us six terabytes of compressed files.

254
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,690
两千五百万美国电话电报公司用户的信息
All 25 million AT&T users.

255
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,610
你的货存错地方了
You hid your goodies with the wrong person.

256
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,840
-不止他一个  -我觉得就他一个
- He wasn't the only one. - I think he was.

257
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,460
我的指控已经撤销了  你没法逮捕我
You can't arrest me for charges that have already been dropped.

258
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,410
放松  没人要逮捕你
Relax. No one's arresting you.

259
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,910
从我手上的报告看
From the reports I've been getting,

260
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,860
你工作一直很出色
you've been doing an excellent job for us.

261
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,260
好好继续干下去  前途无量
If you stay straight, sky's the limit.

262
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,400
接大任务  领导自己的团队
Bigger assignments. Manage your own team.

263
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,850
你知道我也是走投无路才来的
You know I wouldn't be here if I had a choice.

264
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,390
但你现在有选择了
But you do have a choice.

265
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,550
你可以充分利用这第二次机会
You can make the most of this second chance if you want to,

266
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,380
但你得证明你想要这机会
but... you have to prove you want it.

267
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,630
-名字  -我不求别的
- Names. - That's all I've ever wanted.

268
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,880
不行
No.

269
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,870
亚设会供出名字的
Asher's going to give up names.

270
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,080
-他不会那么做的  -或许会
- He wouldn't do that. - He might.

271
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,730
但愿他们不会抖出些
Let's hope none of them tell us

272
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,910
我们还不知道的你的罪行
about anything we didn't charge you for.

273
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,750
你在这里可以有大好未来  嘉文
You have a future here, Gavin.

274
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,860
好了  回去吧
All right. Back to it.

275
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,440
好好工作
Keep up the good work.

276
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,940
我们得去晚宴了
We have to wine and dine.

277
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,970
-要迷倒他们  -他们  还有谁
- Charm them senseless. - Them? Who's the other?

278
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,410
博奇  他压着《美就法》不肯动弹
Birch. He's sitting on AmWorks like his ass is afraid of the sun.

279
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,320
别逼我跟鲍勃聊天
Please don't make me talk to Bob.

280
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,930
你只用负责佩特罗夫  我来对付鲍勃
You just focus on Petrov. I'll deal with Bob.

281
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,430
打扰一下  先生  我们准备好了
Excuse me, sir. We're all set.

282
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,170
佩特罗夫总统在黄色椭圆厅了
President Petrov is in the Yellow Oval.

283
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,430
谢谢  卡莉斯塔
Thank you, Calista.

284
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,740
我可能需要弥补一下凯茜
I think I may need to do some damage control with Cathy.

285
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,090
-为什么  -我一直努力对她恭敬
- Why? - I've been trying to be deferential,

286
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,890
但她可能觉得我是自视高她一等
but I think it's coming off as patronizing.

287
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,040
-本就有这风险  -我知道
- Well, that was the risk. - I know.

288
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,620
她觉得受威胁了吗
Is she feeling threatened?

289
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,620
威胁  不会  可能有点被抢了风头
Threatened, no. Possibly overshadowed.

290
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,490
我的关注度太高
I think I'm getting too much attention

291
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,750
凯茜不跟我一队
and it's tough to be effective

292
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,020
我会举步维艰
when I don't have Cathy on my team,

293
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,800
我可能得讨她欢心
so I may need to win her over.

294
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,390
别忘了今晚的主角应该是谁
Well, let's not forget where the focus is tonight.

295
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,150
我什么时候不能一心二用了
Since when can't I do two things at once?

296
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,670
-你歪了  -什么
- You're crooked. - What?

297
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,410
-准备好去战斗了吗  -是的

大家的注意力都会在你身上  不是他们
All eyes at the table will be on you, not them.

307
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,170
门多萨参议员  不久就是总统候选人了
Senator Mendoza. Soon to be candidate Mendoza.

308
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,440
这就谣言四起了
The rumor mill begins.

309
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,680
你最开始是跟着里根  对吗
You started with Reagan, no?

310
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,240
他84年竞选团队的一员
Staffed on his '84 campaign.

311
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,510
他办公室里有张里根总统戴牛仔帽的照片
He has a portrait of the Gipper in his office wearing a cowboy hat.

312
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
那时男人还有男子气概
When men were men.

313
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,140
鲍勃  我有个想法
Bob, I had a thought.

314
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,980
大卫·布兰切特在军事委员会
Dave Blanchek is on Armed Services and--

315
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,600
我不想让后面的人久等
I don't want to hold up the line.

316
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,750
-总统先生  很荣幸  -移下博奇的位置
- Mr. President, a pleasure. - I want to move Birch.

317
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,580
门多萨换到我边上来
Put Mendoza next to me instead.

318
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,320
艾伦  收拾得挺利索

319
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,970
场合需要
Class by association.

320

-你的女伴呢  -我一个人来的
- Where's your date? - I don't have one.

321
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,810
你想得话  我可以陪你走进去
I can walk you in too, if you'd like.

322
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,690
不了  那不是要毁了你的照片

326
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,110
过了这么久才有机会在同一张桌子上坐下
It's taken us too long to sit at the same table.

327
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,440
你们在闭门会议时讨论了我们的问题吗
Did you discuss our issues in the closed talks?

328
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,130
我们讨论了很多事

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,990

感谢你们的光临
Спасибо, что вы пришли.

337
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,760
翻译过来就是
Which translates into:

338
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,490
"你好  请别偷银器"
"Howdy, and please don't steal the silverware."

339
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,970
卖弄完了我会说的所有俄语之后
Now that I have exhausted all of the Russian I know,

340

346
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,120
对于美国和俄国的看法是这样
in regards to America and Russia, the following:

347
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,290
"他们的出发点和道路不同
"Their point of departure and their paths diverse,

348
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,380
可是  两国似乎都
nevertheless, each seems called

349
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,200
受到了天意的秘密召唤
by some secret desire of providence,

350
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,590
终有一天要将半个世界的命运掌握在自己手里"
to one day hold in their hands the destinies of half the world."

351
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,090
今晚我想做点修改
Well, I'd like to amend that tonight and say,

352
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,660
并不只是半个世界
not just half the world,

353
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,140
全球都指望我们的领导
the entire world looks to us for leadership.

354
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,700
让我们敬佩特罗夫总统

358
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,470
永远别给法国人机会
Никогда не добрай францусзам.

359
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,770
翻译过来就是  "永远不要相信法国人"

00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,090
比德·托克维尔时代更晚一点
Now, a little more recently than de Tocqueville,

363
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,210
大概三十年前
about, uh, 30 years ago,

364
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,480
米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫来到白宫
Mikhail Gorbachev came to this very House

365
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,840
谈到为两国之间的"不满之冬"划上句号
and talked of an end to our "Winter of discontent."

366
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,660
我认为现在可以说那段寒冬早已结束
I think it's safe to say that that winter seems far gone now.

367
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
而现在  在这个醉人的五月夜晚
And here, on this beautiful May evening,

368
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,860
我迎来了这个"迷人之春"
I welcome a "Spring of enchantment."

369

我们都明白它的魅力从何而来

370
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,500
敬您  安德伍德夫人

375
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,600
我知道我们政见有分歧
Now, I know we had our differences.

376
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,600
但我也知道我们的出发点都一样

377
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,980
那就是对我们祖国深深的爱

- что подарил своим друзьям полстраны! - To Viktor Petrov,

383
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,200
他对祖国如此忠诚  以至要将半个国家

-拱手让于他人  -他是如此尊敬异己者

385
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,690
让他们都进了大牢

386
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,960
他开明地接受批评
Who's so open to criticism,

387
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,750
以至于大多批评他的人都已入狱

388
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,270
敬最高统帅维克多·佩特罗夫
За Виктора Пертова, Верховного Главнокомандующего,

389
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,470
他什么都不怕  却害怕同性恋者
которому не страшен никто! Кроме геев.

390
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,170
够了
Хватить!

391
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,550
你们的意思已经很明白了
You made your point.

392
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,900
现在  请坐吧  让我们大家
Now, please, sit and let us all

393
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,640
像真正的俄罗斯人那样开怀畅饮
drink and laugh, like true Russians do.

394
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,470
总统先生
Well, Mr. President,

395
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,290
这就证明你们不要孩子
this is proof why you made the right decision

396
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,680
是多么明智的决定
never to have children.

397
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,590
我的手下跟他们交待过
My staff prepped them.

398
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,510
-他们向我们做了保证  -没关系

399
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,000
-我敬佩你的胸襟  -没关系  无需多言

400
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,160
我就知道请暴动小猫不是个好主意
I knew Pussy Riot was a bad idea.

401
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,660
你该去处理
You should go.

402
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,650
不  最好的处理就是不作评论
No. Best thing is not to comment.

403
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,070
否则我们会沦为跟他们一个档次
It lowers us to their level.

404
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,190
喝果汁还是汽水
Juice or soda?

405
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,480
低热量的就行  如果你有的话
Diet something, if you got it.

406
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,570
照片上是谁
Who are they?

-资浅参议员  -没错
- Junior Congressman? - That's right.

414
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,370
我挺喜欢他  他人不错  很有野心
I like him. He's a good guy. He's ambitious.

415
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,060
他给我开了很高的工资
He offered me a lot of money.

416
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,320
-是吗  -22万年薪
- Yeah? - Two-twenty.

417
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,250
老天
Jesus.

418
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,220
我在白宫永远挣不了这么多
That's more than I would ever make at the White House.

419
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,970
-这工作是你安排的吗  -不是
- You arrange the job? - No.

420
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,820
是总统安排的
Did the President?

421
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,570
-你在说什么啊  -别糊弄我  赛斯
- What are you talking about? - Don't bullshit me, Seth.

422
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,410
我头一次听说这事
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

423
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,750
我认识他  我只是一时想不起来
I know him, I'm just drawing a blank right now.

426
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,420
不是他  是她
It's not him, it's a her.

427
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,150
弗朗辛·谭纳卡  如果你不知道谭纳卡是谁
Francine Tenaka. And if you don't know who Tenaka is,

428
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,430
那你根本不应该认识布拉德·帕蒂特
there's no reason you should know who Brad Petite is,

429
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,600
也不该知道他人怎么样  是否有野心
or that he's ambitious or a good guy.

430
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,240
这个工作机会是你或是总统安排的
This job offer came from you or the President.

431
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,050
我告诉你并非如此
And I'm telling you that it didn't.

432
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,800
我准备拒绝
Well, I'm turning it down.

433
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,110
你转告总统
You tell the President that

434
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,930
只要他需要我  我随时能回去工作
I'm ready to come back whenever he needs me.

435
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,320
我不需要辅助训练
I don't need training wheels.

436
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,100
我需要你今晚上做做博奇的工作
I need you to work on Birch while you're here.

437
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,680
看能不能打听出潜在候选人名单
See if you can get that list of possible candidates.

438
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,810
他被安排在了桌子边上
I don't think putting him down the far end of the table's

439
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,480
好像不太想聊天呢
put him in a very chatty mood.

440
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,130
冷藏  你是在说冷藏吗
Refrigeration. Are you talking about refrigeration?

441
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,500
不是  重新建立桥梁
No. Re-bridge nations.

442
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,940
要在两国之间
We need to re-bridgenate

443
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,790
重新建立桥梁  好增进信任
ourselves so we'll more trust each other.

444
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,280
对吗  对的
Da? Yes.

445
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,830
把修正案递交给国会吧
Let's get these amendments out of committee.

446
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,340
不用全部递交  一部分就行
Not all of them, just some of them.

447
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,660
我要是干涉国会  议长肯定要发飙的
The Speaker would go ballistic if I started meddling in the House.

448
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,280
你可是潜在候选人  他不会轻易跟你翻脸
Not if it means he's going to battle with the presumptive nominee.

449
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,950
他知道得靠谁吃饭
He knows where his bread is buttered.

450
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,340
你休会任命了你老婆  逼我接受
You shove your wife's recess appointment down my throat,

451
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,150
现在还找我帮忙吗
now you want my help?

452
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,670
总要有人担任那个职位
I had to fill the post.

453
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,650
华盛顿哪没有外交专家
And you have a city full of career diplomats.

454
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,950
任命她简直就是打参议院的脸
Her appointment was a slap in the Senate's face.

455
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,220
不要在一项任命上纠结
Let's not get hung up on appointments, all right?

456
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,450
赫克特  你要我签署什么都可以
Hector, whatever you want me to sign, I'll sign.

457
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,650
我不会拿否决要挟你
I will not hold a veto over your head.

458
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,180
你可以随便否决  反正也是帮我们16年的忙
You can veto whatever you want. Just helps our case in 2016.

459
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,120
失陪了
Excuse me.

460
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,840
哪个更醉人  是酒还是克莱尔·安德伍德
Which is more intoxicating, this wine or Claire Underwood?

461
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,690
你经常用这句台词吗
How often do you use that line?

462
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,610
-没你那句用得多  -哪句
- Not as often as you use yours. - Which line is that?

463
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,320
"维克多  你在恋爱吗"
"Viktor, are you in love?"

464
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,970
德斯科托总统说
President Descoteaux told me

465
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,370
他来的时候你也问了这句话
you asked him the same thing when he was here.

466
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,670
那晚我丈夫祝酒的时候
I believe my husband quoted

467
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,650
好像引用了俄国作家的话
a Russian author the night he gave that toast.

468
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,410
-我猜猜  托尔斯泰吗  -普希金
- Don't say, uh... Tolstoy? - Pushkin.

469
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,170
"升华友谊的谎言
"A deception that elevates us

470
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,020
要好过一堆无用的事实"
is dearer than a host of low truths."

471
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,320
他才没那么说
He didn't make that toast.

472
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,960
-是没有  -没有
- No, he didn't. - No, no.

473
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,520
说实话  你是真了解普希金
Tell me, do you actually know your Pushkin,

474
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,180
还是知道我来才研究的
or did you just study up before I arrived?

475
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,040
重要吗
Does it really matter?

476
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,400
他就是这么做事吗
So, this is what he does?

477
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,590
让你来诱惑别人
He leaves the seduction to you.

478
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,140
是不是有个词来着
Isn't there a... a word for that in English?

479
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,340
-什么词  -拉皮条  是吗
- For what? - "Pimping," Yes?

480
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,150
他在给你拉皮条
He's pimping you out.

481
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,990
你真有风度
How charming you are.

482
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,560
谢谢
Thank you.

483
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,190
据我的人说  你做第一夫人
And you make a much better First Lady than ambassador,

484
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,860
比作大使强多了
from what my people tell me.

485
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,330
开玩笑的
Only teasing.

486
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,520
再来点酒  给大使的
More wine... for the ambassador.

487
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,910
请吧
Please.

488
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,330
我得回去一会儿
I'm gonna have to go in a couple minutes.

489
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,830

00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,720
尤其是我的朋友  彼得·辛科蒂
But most especially to my friend, Peter Cincotti.

581
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,280
谢谢你
Thank you.

582
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,060
大老远来到白宫
Coming all the way here to the White House.

583
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,520
谢谢  谢谢你们带来的精彩一晚
Thank you. Thank you! Thank you for a wonderful evening.

584
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,410
精彩绝伦  感谢你  辛科蒂先生
Wonderful. And thank you to you, Mr. Cincotti.

585
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,920
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

586
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,640
您的车队准备好了  总统先生
Your motorcade is ready, Mr. President.

587
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,750
我送你出去
I'll walk you out.

588
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,210
但我想先带你看样东西  跟我来
But first, I want to show you something. Come with me.

589
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,260
-我们马上来  卡莉斯塔  -好的  先生
- We'll be right down, Calista. - Yes, sir.

590
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,200
我要是帮你换到别的机构去呢
What if I get you transferred? To some other agency.

591
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,520
这跟我在哪工作没关系  他会想出法子的
It doesn't matter who I work for. He'll find a way.

592
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,930
你很想留在这里吗
How much do you care about staying here?

593
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,390
-什么  特区吗  -这个国家
- What, DC? - In this country.

594
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,770
他们把我护照锁了
I'd have been long gone if

595
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,740
要不然我早跑了
they didn't put a travel lock on my passport.

596
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,620
那就解锁啊
So let's unlock it.

597
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,000
你能办到吗  要是我给你你想要的
Is that something you can do? If I get you what you want?

598
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,230
我需要知道她具体在哪
I need to know exactly where she is.

599
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,190
不要告诉我哪个州还是哪个市  我要地址
Not a state. Not a city. An address.

600
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,880
我要是用局里的软件查被抓包了
If I use the Bureau's software and get caught,

601
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,990
我会把你的名字抖出来
I'll give them your name.

602
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,890
我理解
I understand.

603
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,040
好吧
All right.

604
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,020
把你知道她的事全告诉我
Tell me everything you know about her.

605
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,370
晚安
Good night.

606
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,650
-深夜小酌一杯  -太晚了
- How about a night cap? - Oh, it's late.

607
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,240
大学之后就没喝过那么多伏特加了
And I haven't had that much vodka since college.

608
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,450
杜兰大学  是吗
Tulane, right?

609
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,900
别人是这么说的  我都记不清了
So they tell me. It's all a bit of a blur.

610
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,610
你在学校喝什么  飓风鸡尾酒吗
What did you drink in school? Hurricanes?

611
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,670
我们不是野蛮人  威士忌不加冰
Oh, we weren't barbarians. Scotch, no ice.

612
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,370
两杯芝华士  不加冰
Two Chivas, neat.

613
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,330
古巴货  偷运进来的
Cubans. Smuggled in.

614
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,420
想着你会喜欢这其中的讽刺意味
I thought you might appreciate the irony.

615
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,300
没错
I do.

616
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,130
这通到哪
And where does this lead?

617
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,680
地下室入口
Basement entrance.

618
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,460
尼克松的孩子从这儿带约会对象进来
The Nixon kids would bring their dates up this way.

619
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,670
肯尼迪估计也用来干过类似的事
Kennedy probably used it for similar reasons.

620
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,250
要知道  我现在离婚了
Well, you know, now that I'm divorced,

621
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,510
我用不着偷偷带人进克里姆林宫
I don't have to sneak anyone in and out of the palace.

622
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,480
他们能从正门光明正大地进来
They can come through the front door. With some dignity.

623
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,490
拿"光明正大"来形容情妇有点过了吧
Well, dignity's a bit overrated for a mistress, don't you think?

624
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,820
有些女人  比如你妻子那样的
You know, a woman like your wife, for example,

625
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,650
绝对值得人费这个事
would certainly make it worthwhile.

626
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,530
你会见过的总统的老婆你都亲吗
Do you kiss the wife of every president you meet?

627
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,190
可不是每位总统的老婆都像你妻子那么美
Not every president's wife looks like yours.

628
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,060
我真想立马把他从楼梯上推下去摔死再焚尸
I'd push him down the stairs and light his broken body on fire

629
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,660
眼看着他烧成灰
just to watch it burn,

630
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,760
只可惜那会引发世界大战
if it wouldn't start a world war.

631
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,150
-我能下去看看吗  -请便
- May I? - Of course.

632
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,170
你觉得他们能回心转意吗
Well, do you think they'll ever come around?

633
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,760
我可说不准
Oh, I don't know.

634
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,360
肯定还要开更多峰会  派国会代表团
There'll be more summits, a hundred CoDels.

635
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,520
像打乒乓那样来回扯好几个月
They'll ping-pong back and forth for months

636
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,400
佩特罗夫才会表明心意
before Petrov shows his hand.

637
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,120
-怎么了  -没什么
- What? - Nothing.

638
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,550
告诉我吧
Tell me.

639
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,950
我只是在想象布格考夫打乒乓的样子
I was just picturing Bugakov playing ping-pong.

640
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,020
布加耶夫
Bugayev?

641
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,110
想想他玩啤酒乒乓球的样子吧
Imagine him playing beer pong.

642
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,730
那这谈判也不用谈了
Then these negotiations would be over.

643
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:07,870
我可是ΔΦ联谊会的啤酒乒乓赛冠军
You are looking at the Delta Phi beer pong champion.

644
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,150
-不是吧  -是真的
- No. - Yes.

645
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,480
大二大三蝉联两届
Both sophomore and junior years.

646
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,970
大四怎么没赢
And what happened senior year?

647
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,400
我得备考法学院了
Well, I had to start studying for law school.

648
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,360
我虽然说不上是冠军
Well, I wasn't... a champion.

649
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,060
-不过玩得也不赖  -你
- I wasn't too bad, though. - You?

650
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,120
-咱俩该玩两局  -什么
- I think we should play. - What?

651
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,000
-你开玩笑的吧  -不好意思
- Oh, you can't be serious. - Excuse me?

652
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,240
能否去跟内务人员要几个乒乓球来
Can you ask housekeeping to bring us some ping-pong balls, please?

653
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,380
我得回家了
I have got to go home.

654
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,110
我们就按哈佛的规矩来
We'll be playing by Harvard rules.

655
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,040
他们的无畏值得尊敬
You have to admire their fearlessness.

656
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,520
不过他们不会理解的  对不对
None of them understand, do they?

657
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,000
统治需要的决断
What it takes to govern.

658
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,070
他们大喊大叫  上蹿下跳
They scream and yell and stomp their feet,

659
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,860
但要真让他们坐在我们的位子上
but if they had to spend just one day in our shoes,

660
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,970
体会一下我们肩上的担子
the weight we carry on our shoulders...

661
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,600
比如说  中东
Like, um... the Middle East?

662
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,880
我知道我们躲到这里抽烟是为什么
Oh, I know why we're here, smoking our cigars.

663
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,310
-怎么样  -你不会喜欢我的回答的
- And? - You're not going to like it.

664
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,170
中了
Yes!

665
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,550
快干了
Drink up.

666
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,890
好  为了哈佛
Okay. For the Crimson.

667
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,440
可恶
Damn!

668
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,320
神技仍在
Yes! I still got it.

669
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,780
你不用喝光了的
You don't have to drink that.

670
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,870
多谢你手下留情
I accept your mercy.

671
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,100
趁你没要求重赛  我赶紧回家吧
And I am going to leave before you challenge me to a rematch.

672
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,170
你都不给我在自己家里赢一回的机会吗
You're not even gonna give me a shot at winning in my own house?

673
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,010
外交界第一法则  见好就收
First rule of diplomacy: stop while you're ahead,

674
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,290
佩特罗夫敬第三杯伏特加时
which is what I should've done,

675
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,110
我也该见好就收的
after that third vodka of Petrov's.

676
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,620
你怎么看这个人
What do you think of him?

677
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,960
佩特罗夫吗  我不知道
Petrov? I don't know.

678
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,140
跟他聊了一晚上的人是你啊
You were the one who talked to him all night.

679
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,000
礼仪要求  我没得选
Well, I didn't have much of a choice.

680
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,900
看来你不喜欢他
So, not a fan?

681
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,100
我认为他很聪明  独具魅力
I think he's very intelligent. And he has a charm.

682
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,430
他亲你  有点过分了
That kiss was... too much.

683
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,310
不  他那是非常过分
No, that's just pushing buttons.

684
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,420
俄国人就喜欢这么惹别人
The Russians love to do that.

685
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,310
晚安
Good night.

686
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,270
我觉得不能相信他  凯茜
I don't think he's to be trusted, Cathy.

687
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,940
尤其是今晚之后  让我不禁思考
Especially after tonight. And it made me think...

688
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,420
继续说
Go on.

689
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,770
这让我重新考虑了弗兰西斯的计划
It made me wonder about Francis' plan.

690
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,380
我认为与佩特罗夫合作未必是好主意
I'm not sure that it's a good idea to be partnered with Petrov.

691
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,060
而且我们还破坏了与以色列和巴勒斯坦的关系
In the meantime, we alienate Israel and Palestine.

692
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,080
私下里告诉你  我也同意
Well... between you and me, I agree.

693
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,590
过来坐
Sit with me.

694
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,230
那你想采取什么不同的办法呢
What would you do differently?

695
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,660
这个
Well...

696
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,810
如果最终目标是向约旦河谷派军的话
If the goal is to get troops into the Jordan Valley,

697
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,520
达到目标的办法可不止一种
well, then there's more than one way to skin that cat.

698
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,540
多国部队吗
A multinational force?

699
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,670
我倾向通过联合国
I would go through the UN.

700
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,770
维和部队吗
Peacekeeping?

701
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,720
但俄罗斯会否决的
You wouldn't get past Russia's veto.

702
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,180
也许有个办法  但是...
There might be a way, but...

703
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,580
那样你就有很重的任务了
you'd have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders.

704
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,410
如果你能指点我  我相信我能处理好
Well, if you can give me guidance, I'm sure I can handle it.

705
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:55,150
以前有联合维和决议案的先例
There is precedent with the Uniting for Peace Resolution.

706
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,290
我们就是借这个  绕过苏俄发动了朝鲜战争
We used it to get around the Russians for the Korean War.

707
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,530
-全部吗  -从波兰到英国
- The whole thing? - From Poland to the UK.

708
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,810
我希望整个导弹防御系统都拆除
I want the entire missile defense system gone.

709
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,700
你知道那是为了防御朝鲜和伊朗
You know that's there to defend against North Korea, against Iran.

710
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,830
但比起朝鲜伊朗  却离我国更近
And far closer to my borders than theirs.

711
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,560
我只是希望你派几千部队进入约旦河谷
I'm asking for a few thousand troops in the Jordan Valley.

712
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,030
你却要求我废除欧洲的防御系统
You're asking me to dismantle Europe's defense system.

713
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,190
你真正的要求是让美国部队
What you're really asking for is American forces

714
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,730
进入高加索南部
just south of the Caucasus.

715
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,500
你肯定已经想好了战略规划
You must have a strategic play in mind.

716
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,560
这是为了地区稳定
This is about stability in the region.

717
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,550
你是想巩固在这个地区的地位吧
You're trying to consolidate your foothold in the region.

718
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,680
黑海  哈萨克斯坦  车臣  克里米亚
The Black Sea, Kazakhstan, Chechnya, Crimea.

719
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,630
拜托  别扯什么和平来侮辱我了
So, please... don't insult me with peace.

720
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,490
无论你的战略目标是什么
Whatever your strategic goals may be,

721
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,730
导弹防御系统是我的
the missile defense system is mine.

722
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,140
维克多  我邀请你来华盛顿的目的很纯粹
Viktor, I invited you to Washington with pure intentions,

723
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,260
就是为了我们能一起进餐  学习信任对方
so that we could break bread and learn to trust one another.

724
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,620
弗兰西斯  一顿美妙的晚餐
Francis, I don't get softened up

725
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,580
和与美丽的女士共舞不会让我心软的
by a nice dinner and dancing with a beautiful woman.

726
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,630
你问我想要什么
You asked me what I want.

727
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,880
我告诉你了
Well... I told you.

728
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,440
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

729
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,500
现在我要去睡会儿了
It's my turn to get some sleep.

730
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,600
等头脑清醒点再处理这些事吧
Let's attack all this with a fresh mind.

731
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,510
我们还没抽完雪茄呢
We've barely smoked our cigars.

732
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,050
我们不是那种无节制的人  对吧
We're not men of excess, though, are we?

733
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,740
不是吗
Aren't we?

734
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,160
不是
No, no.

735
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,230
不  你说得对
No, you're right.

736
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,050
这一晚上抽得够多了
Enough smoke for one evening.

737
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,710
你打算怎么办
What are you going to do?

738
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,070
不知道
I don't know.

739
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,860
想办法与他妥协吧
Try to meet him halfway.

740
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,360
凯茜和我聊了一会儿
Cathy and I were talking.

741
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,770
也许以色列人和巴勒斯坦人是对的
Maybe the Israelis and the Palestinians are right.

742
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,570
我们应该考虑从他们下手
We should consider starting with them.

743
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,690
利用联合国向俄罗斯施压
Use the United Nations to put pressure on Russia.

744
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,680
-怎么施压  -联合维和
- How? - Uniting for Peace.

745
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,420
让联合国大会推翻
General Assembly overrides

746
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,520
俄罗斯在安理会投的否决票
a Russian veto in the Security Council.

747
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,250
即便成功  也只会激怒他们
Well, that'll just antagonize them even if it works.

748
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,110
何况不可能成功
And it won't.

749
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,570
也许呢  凯茜似乎认为会成功
Well, it might work. Cathy seems to think it could.

750
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,000
我以为你对这计划有信心
I thought you believed in this plan.

751
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,850
我们只是在考虑别的选择
We were just... brainstorming alternatives.

752
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,010
我付出了这么多努力  怎么能前功尽弃
Well, I've worked too hard on it just to abandon it.

753
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,400
好吧  你知道怎么最好
Okay, you know best.

754
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,200
你介意吗
Do you mind?

755
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,340
什么
What?

756
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,720
关灯
The light.

757
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,890
弗兰西斯
Francis.

758
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,300
他是个恶棍
He's a thug.

759
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,680
很聪明  但也还是个恶棍
Smart, but he's still a thug.

760
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,390
别向他屈服
Don't cower to him.

761
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,970
在我的家乡
Where I come from,

762
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,470
我们会把生鸡蛋放进番茄汁里  然后喝掉
we drop a raw egg into some tomato juice and drink that.

763
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,590
还好我不来自你的家乡
Luckily, I don't come from there.

764
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,910
那份工作很适合道格
That's a perfect job for Doug.

765
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,750
真不明白他为什么拒绝
I can't imagine why he'd turn it down.

766
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,410
他觉得是我们在背后安排的
He thinks we were behind it.

767
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,040
我告诉他并没有  但恐怕他不相信我
I told him we weren't, but I don't think he believes me.

768
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,910
说他不需要辅助训练
Said he doesn't need training wheels.

769
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,190
我要你继续偶尔去看看他
Well, I want you to still stop in from time to time and see him.

770
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,020
是  先生
Yes, sir.

771
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,860
国防部长来了吗  让他进来
Is the Secretary of Defense here? Send him in.

772
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,660
-总统先生  -我们没多少时间
- Mr. President. - We don't have much time.

773
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,250
佩特罗夫90分钟后到  我们得谈欧洲的情况
Petrov gets here in 90 minutes. We need to talk Europe.

774
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,540
答案是可以
The answer is yes.

775
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,630
可以接受你的部分但并非全部要求
To some, not all, of what you asked.

776
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:01,550
好吧
I see.

777
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,020
我准备对导弹防御系统进行大规模削减
I'm prepared to scale back significantly.

778
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:08,700
我得先跟我的团队及我们的北约同盟国商量下
Now, I have to speak to my team first and my allies in NATO,

779
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,260
但我相信我们可以在波兰和捷克共和国
but I'm confident that we can do something meaningful

780
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,320
作出重要调整
in Poland and the Czech Republic.

781
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,820
我们双方可以就细节做进一步协商
Now, our people can work out the specifics.

782
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,930
但无论我们达成怎样的共识
And whatever it is we decide and agree on,

783
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,020
都不能让公众知晓
the public cannot know.

784
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,210
我醒来时满嘴都是昨晚抽过的雪茄味
I woke up with the taste of those cigars in my mouth.

785
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,200
让我想到了古巴导弹危机和肯尼迪
Thinking of Cuba and Kennedy.

786
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,440
我可不会像赫鲁晓夫
I won't be humiliated the way

787
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,380
在土耳其导弹问题上那样被羞辱
Khrushchev was with Turkey.

788
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,380
{\pos(382,286)}{\an3}古巴导弹危机时
美国最终从土耳其撤军
比苏联晚一些  而且是秘密撤军
表面上来看是这场危机的胜利者

789
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,550
你不能将我的提议
Well, you can't possibly compare

790
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:40,590
与当时的事件相提并论
what I'm proposing to what happened then.

791
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:42,600
只有你同意对外宣布
I can only consider a partial scale-back

792
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,970
我才会接受部分削减
if you announce it.

793
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,780
这场新闻发布会是关于约旦河谷问题
This press conference is about the Jordan Valley.

794
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,840
调整导弹防御系统的重点是削减
The most important thing about the missiles is the scale-back,

795
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,620
不是公关
not the PR.

796
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,410
我的人民需要知道我不是空手而归
My people would know I walked away with something.

797
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:58,570
而且对外宣布后  我就能逼你信守诺言
And, by announcing it, I can keep you to your word.

798
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,820
我可是做出了相当大的让步  维克多
I am more than meeting you halfway, Viktor.

799
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,600
你知道苏联解体最大快人心之处是什么吗
You know what the best part of the Fall of the Soviet Union was?

800
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,940
是汽车
The cars.

801
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,650
你坐过拉达牌汽车吗
Have you ever been in, um... a Lada?

802
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,710
拉达  没有
Lada? No, I haven't.

803
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,300
没有吗  那是世上最烂的车
No? Oh. It's the worst car ever built.

804
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,180
很小  很袖珍的一辆车
Tiny, little thing, you know.

805
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,970
车开过坑颠一下  你的头就会撞到车顶
Your head would hit the ceiling when you hit a pothole.

806
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,380
暖气永远不制热
And the heat never worked.

807
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,340
还没有空调
And no air conditioning.

808
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,360
大夏天皮肤都要粘到座位上
You know, your skin would stick to the seats in the summer.

809
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,350
简直是可移动的棺材
It was a coffin on wheels.

810
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,290
但苏联解体后  就能买到雷克萨斯
But then, after the Fall, we got the Lexus.

811
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,470
有空调  自动车窗
Temperature control. Automatic windows.

812
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,570
而且空间很大
And so much room.

813
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,150
我第一次上我前妻  就是在一辆雷克萨斯里
First time I fucked my ex-wife, in a Lexus.

814
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,890
在拉达里你想都不要想
You could never do that in a Lada.

815
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:54,720
空间根本不够
No space.

816
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,780
现在情况是这样  总统先生
You see, Mr. President.

817
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,700
我想要雷克萨斯
I want the Lexus.

818
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,420
你却向我推销拉达
And you're trying to sell me a Lada.

819
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,130
我去让你的车队来接你
I'll have them bring your motorcade around.

820
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,560
但还有新闻发布会
But the... press conference.

821
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,050
对啊
Right!

822
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,070
我忘得一干二净
I'd completely forgotten.

823
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,030
不过今天不做新闻发布会也不要紧
But I think we're gonna be okay without one today.

824
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,090
回程一路顺风  总统先生
Have a safe journey home, Mr. President.

825
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,490
多谢你的款待  总统先生
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. President.

826
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,350
给我接国务卿
Give me the Secretary of State.

827
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,550
总统将单独发表讲话
The President will be speaking alone.

828
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,190
不举行联合新闻发布会
No joint conference.

829
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,460
总统很快就来
The President will be out shortly.

830
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,270
昨晚  我有幸在白宫招待了
Last night, I had the pleasure of hosting

831
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,900
几位非常尊贵的宾客
some very special guests here at the White House.

832
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,250
几位真正的俄罗斯爱国者
True Russian patriots

833
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:56,280
他们展现了他们国家最优良的美德
who exhibit the very best that their country has to offer.

834
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,560
他们的名字是  娜迪亚·托伦科尼卡瓦
Their names: Nadya Tolokonnikova,

835
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,190
玛莎·艾柳金纳和彼得·韦奇洛夫
Masha Alyokhina and Pyotr Verzilov.

836
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,960
你们应该已经知道
As you're all aware,

837
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,070
他们敢于挑战佩特罗夫总统
they stood up to President Petrov,

838
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,970
并强迫他倾听他不愿听到的真相
and forced him to listen to the truths that he didn't want to hear.

839
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,040
这令我深受震撼
And, well, that had a profound effect on me.

840
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:17,840
因为这让我意识到
Because it made me realize

841
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,560
我也要勇于与他抗衡
that I need to stand up to him as well.

842
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,340
我们的国家也一样
As does our country.

843
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,290
我邀请总统来访
When I invited the President here,

844
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,090
是旨在结交盟友
I set out hoping to find a partner.

845
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,320
但佩特罗夫总统的要求让我明白
But the demands that President Petrov made proves to me

846
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,470
和平并非他的第一诉求
that peace is not a priority for him.

847
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:37,130
和平不该通过买卖取得
Peace should not have to be bought.

848
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,070
和平本就该足矣
Peace should be its own reward,

849
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,840
不论他是否是我们的盟友
and we will achieve it,

850
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,010
我们终会迎来和平
with or without him.

851
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,360
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

852
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,340
你知道怎样能绕过俄国
You have thoughts on how to bypass Russia.

853
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:51,960
就是要让俄国在联合国安理会的否决票无效
The idea is to negate Russia's veto in the Security Council.

854
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,660
我会让大使向您介绍我们的想法
I'll let the Ambassador tell you what we have in mind.

856
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:33,730
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}刚上任时  奥巴马渴望同俄罗斯进行合作
2009年奥巴马派遣国务卿希拉里到日内瓦会见俄罗斯外长拉夫罗夫
希拉里特意携带了一个具有象征性的红色按钮
称要同俄罗斯"重置"外交关系
作为一种友好姿态
美国主动终止了在捷克和波兰境内设置导弹防御系统的计划
然而时间证明
奥巴马和希拉里"重置外交关系"的努力并没有获得克里姆林宫的认可
白宫伸出的橄榄枝并没有收获合作与和平
美国前中情局情报员斯诺登向世界泄露大量美国军事机密后
到俄罗斯寻求庇护  得到普京收容
被媒体解读为打在奥巴马脸上的一记耳光

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2014年  随着克里米亚和乌克兰局势的恶化
美国政府更是发现俄国不仅没有同美国进行合作的意愿
而且在欧洲事务上几乎是一意孤行  唯我独尊
但是面对克里米亚和乌克兰危机
白宫除了联合欧洲盟国进行经济制裁
并没有其它更有效的办法制约普京
奥巴马因此也在美国国内招致很大非议
在过去的一年中  美国多个机构的民调结果都显示
美国多数民众对奥巴马处理外交
尤其是乌克兰事务的能力表示信心不足
