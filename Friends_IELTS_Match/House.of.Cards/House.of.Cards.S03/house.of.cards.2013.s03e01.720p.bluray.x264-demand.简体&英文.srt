00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,250
他们在准备棉花糖了
They're getting their marshmallows ready.

156
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,140
看看安德伍德的支持率
Look at Underwood's approval rating.

157
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,420
比沃克辞职之前的还糟
It's worse than Walker's before he resigned.

158

要从那个坑里爬出来  会很不容易
That's a deep, deep hole to climb out of.

159

共和党会得意一阵了
The Republicans are gonna have their fun for a while.

160
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,870
普选时有很多可以拿来打击他的东西

161

而且他们一心想伤人见血

《美国就业法案》的传言是真...
about America Works are true...

165
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,160
这计划对左派太右
For the left, that's just too far to the right

166
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,070
对右派太左
and for the right, it's too far to the left.

167
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,300
他们需要我回去
They need me back.

168
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,770
哪里  白宫吗
Where? The White House?

169

我们得扭转局势  开始为2016造声势

他或许能扭转乾坤呢
He might turn this around.

171
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,110
你不是真觉得他会赢吧
You don't really think he's gonna win, do you?

172
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,960
他经验丰富  安德伍德有很多...
The guy's experienced. Underwood has a lot...

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,130
他会恢复的
He'll recover.

174
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,030
他是个幕后推手
He's a behind-the-scenes guy.

175
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,740
他在聚光灯下不自在
He's not comfortable in the spotlight.

176
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,460
不如你先恢复吧
How about you recover first?

177
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,670
...假意热情  亲吻婴儿
...glad-handing and kissing babies.

178
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,480
如果这证明了什么  就是这18个月会很漫长
This is gonna be a long 18 months if this proves any indication.

179
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,960
会许下一堆空头承诺
It can be a lot of chest-thumping

180
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,680
但却毫无建树
but nothing really getting done.

181
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,780
解忧灵有助缓解抑郁症
The Xybenetrin will help with depression.

182
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,590
丁螺环酮是治疗焦虑的  给你

不  他还在睡呢
No, he's still asleep.

189
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,860
我得挂了
I have to go.

190
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,290
好

打扰你了吗
Is this a bad time?

192
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,700
没有  没事
No. It's fine.

193
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,530
就是没人告诉我你要来

196
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,930
不  我懂
No, I understand.

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,490

He did come before, when...

198
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,130

弗兰西斯  他真是无计可施了  共和党...
Francis, he's at his wit's end. The Republicans...

不肯给他一张他能签的法案

207

-民主党也好不到哪去  -鲍勃·博奇

你跟我说的原话
exactly what you told me,

234
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,680

有事打给我  我立刻坐飞机过来
I mean, I'm just a phone call and a plane ticket away.

307
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,030
一路顺风
Safe travels.

308
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,620
保重
Take care.

309
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,810
加里
Hey, Gary, I...

310
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,440
给我寄点孩子的照片来
Send me some pictures of the kids.

311
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,110
嗯  好
Yeah, I will.

312
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,040
我欣赏你的一点
But one of the things I admire about you

313
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,180
是在华盛顿特区
is that in Washington, DC,

314
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,120
效率这么低的地方  你总能办成事
which is so gridlocked, you get things done.

315
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,060
据我所知  你有一项新的法案
And I understand you've got, um, a new piece of legislation,

316
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,440
你要推出一项重要的新法案  是什么
a major new initiative you're rolling out. What is it?

317
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,120
没错
That is correct.

318
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,340
是一项新就业计划  《美国就业法案》
It's a new jobs program that we're calling America Works.

319
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,230
那么是奇幻小说喽
So it's a fantasy novel.

320
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,500
这项法案从根本上
This is a fundamentally different look

321
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,580
重新审视了解决就业问题之道
at how to solve the problem of unemployment.

322
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,960
它有罗斯福新政的规模和深度
It has the size and the scope of the New Deal.

323
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,040
那么说是社会主义的财富重新分配政策喽
So it's a socialist redistribution of wealth

324
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,600
让婴儿潮一带像七鳃鳗一样吸住千禧一代wherein the baby boomers will latch onto the millennials like a lamprey

325
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,600
{\pos(198,252)}分别指46年至65年出生的人和80年至00年出生的人

326
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,680
一直到把他们吸干为止
and just keep sucking until they're as dry as a crouton?

327
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,850
这项法案旨在促进就业
This is about putting people to work

328
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,190
完全避免福利政策
and avoiding the entitlements entirely.

329
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
这我喜欢
Well, I like the sound of that.

330
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,720
怎么  我们要让私营公司经营社保
So what, we're gonna privatize Social Security

331
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,650
然后靠把老人赶尽杀绝提高税收吗
and then raise revenue by hunting the elderly for sport?

332
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,660
-好计划  就这么办  -不  我说了
- Good plan. Use that. - No, as I said,

333
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,010
这是一种全新的方式
this is a fundamentally different approach entirely.

334
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,590
你觉得国会的
And you think that the Republicans

335
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,450
共和党人会配合你吗
in Congress will cooperate with you?

336
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,110
我想事实已经证明
Oh, I think that it has been proved

337
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,650
两党的心愿是一致的
that both parties want the same thing.

338
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,920
2016年换个总统吗
A new president in 2016?

339
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,930
不  我认为  彻底根除失业
No. No, I think actually, I think unemployment, eradicating it,

340
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,490
和强盛的经济  是两党共同的愿望
and I think a strong economy is something both parties want.

341
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,280
好吧  说到大家的心愿
Okay, speaking of everyone,

342
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,940
路透社最近做了一项民调
there's a recent poll by Reuters.

343
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,400
我要说对了  结果显示  十分之八的美国人
I wanna get this right. It says that eight out of ten Americans

344
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,520
都认为你  缺乏"效率和领导能力"
agree that you lack, quote, "Effectiveness and leadership."

345
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,360
听我说  我不为这样的民调操心
Uh, look, I don't let polls like that bother me.

346
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,640
我觉得等国人看到《美就法》执行
I think that once the nation sees AmWorks in action,

347
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,310
他们的态度就会转变
they will change their attitudes.

348
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,180
什么  "《美就法》"
I'm sorry, "AmWorks?"

349
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,170
抱歉  我还不知道是叫这么个名字呢
I'm sorry-- I didn't realize it was called AmWorks.

350
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,020
听着像安利啊  是传销吗
Is that like Amway? Is it a pyramid scheme?

351
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,280
这就是你向美国人民兜售的吗
Is that what you're selling the American people?

352
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,650
不  只是个缩略语  说起来方便
No, it's actually just an abbreviation to make it easier to say.

353
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,050
如果缩得够小
Well, if you make it small enough,

354
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,190
或许咽回去就更轻松了
uh, maybe it'll be easier to swallow.

355
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,360
要知道  虽然你是民主党人  我还是尊重你
You know, even though you're a Democrat, I respect you.

356
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,910
但我们先看看事实
But let's just take a look at the facts here for a second.

357
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,350
你才做了六个月的总统
You've been president for six months,

358
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,050
我还是...要说对了
and again, I wanna get this right,

359
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,180
失业率上涨了
unemployment has gone up,

360
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,250
我们与中国的贸易逆差也上涨了
our trade deficit with China has increased,

361
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,500
否决数也大幅激增
the number of vetoes has skyrocketed.

362
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,400
我不太确信
I'm not entirely sure that I'm confident

363
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,640
你能像根除你的支持率那样
that you'll be able to eradicate unemployment the same way

364
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,660
有效地根除失业
you've been able to eradicate your approval polls.

365
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,250
要知道...
What, you know, what do you--

366
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,180
你打算怎样让美国人民信服啊
How are you going to get it across to the American people?

367
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,540
道格
Doug?

368
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,740
赛斯
Seth?

369
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,820
嗯  是我
Yeah, it's me.

370
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,880
安德伍德夫人  她给了我这部手机...
Mrs. Underwood, she gave me this phone, but--

371
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,380
我知道  有什么问题吗
I know. Is something wrong?

372
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,520
没有  我想找总统
No. I want to speak to the president.

373
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,560
急事吗
Is it urgent?

374
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,170
我想跟他谈《美国就业法案》的事
I want to talk to him about the America Works program.

375
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,290
那就不是急事喽
So nothing urgent.

376
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,320
对  不紧急
It's not an emergency, no.

377
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,170
因为这电话是仅供紧急情况
'Cause that's what this phone is for.

378
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,310
你能转达下我的请求吗
Will you pass on my message?

379
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,530
你来迟了
You're late.

380
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,170
我换了三辆出租车
I switched cabs three times.

381
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,400
-你被人跟踪了吗  -不想抱侥幸心理
- Were you being followed? - Didn't want to take chances.

382
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,960
你知道我叫你来做什么
You know why I asked you here.

383
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,310
我不知道她在哪
I don't know where she is.

384
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,540
那你就给我找到
Then you need to find out.

385
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,370
我查了她的社保号  名字
I ran her social, her name,

386
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,160
警方记录  税务记录  都查了
police records, taxes, everything.

387
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,780
她说不定被哪个嫖客丢在阴沟里了
She could be tossed in a ditch by a john for all I know.

388
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,440
-你在联调局工作  -有我什么好处
- You work at the FBI. - What do I get in return?

389
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,180
我的保护  如你所说
My protection, like you asked.

390
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,250
我以为你真有什么  货真价实的东西
I thought you had something to offer. Something real.

391
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,030
钱吗
Like money?

392
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,250
比如帮我脱离联调局
Like getting me out of the Bureau.

393
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,340
你实现这一点  我或许能帮你
You make that happen, maybe I can help you.

394
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,360
说好的条件是撤销对你的指控
That was a condition, for your charges being dropped.

395
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,440
瞧  你现在没人脉了
See, you don't still know people.

396
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,750
我就不该来
I shouldn't have even come here.

397
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,610
我是你唯一的安全保障
I am your only safety net.

398
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,690
你以为我会交出那些美国电话电报公司的记录
You think I would have turned over all the AT&T records

399
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,650
而不给谁留个备份吗
without leaving a backup with somebody?

400
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,990
我不会为了无用功报销我的免牢金牌
I'm not gonna blow my get-out-of-jail card on a wild goose chase.

401
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,110
有人起疑吗
Does anyone suspect anything?

402
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,760
联调局那边
At the Bureau?

403
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,920
没人知道她
Nobody has a clue about her.

404
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,850
如果能让你安心的话
If that gives you any peace of mind.

405
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,190
道格
Doug?

406
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,480
告诉他是急事
Tell him it's urgent.

407
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,390
我们希望能安排在五月
We're aiming for sometime in May.

408
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,890
我们一跟俄国代表团敲定日期
As soon as we agree on a date with the Russian delegation,

409
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,930
就马上告诉你  格雷格
you will be the first to know. Uh, Greg.

410
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,650
与佩特罗夫在华盛顿的峰会
The Summit with Petrov here in Washington,

411
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,470
会谈重点将是什么
what'll be the focus of the talks?

412
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,490
对中东采取的双边政策
A bilateral approach to the Middle East.

413
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,050
你也知道  以色列军队不撤离约旦河谷
As you know, the Palestinians have refused to negotiate

414
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,140
巴勒斯坦就拒绝谈判
until Israeli troops leave the Jordan Valley.

415
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,680
我们希望与佩特罗夫总统商议此事
We hope to address this with President Petrov

416
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,300
也好继续谈很多其他问题
so that we can move on to a whole host of other issues.

417
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,140
萨拉
Sara.

418
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,280
那么这项政策的商议不包含以色列和巴勒斯坦
So this bilateral approach doesn't include Israel and Palestine.

419
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,720
国务院在向所有相关方做简报
The State Department is briefing all interested parties.

420
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,920
峰会只是第一步  艾拉
The summit's really just a first step. Ayla.

421
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,420
我想就《美国就业法案》提问
I'd like to change course to the America Works program.

422
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,220
请问
Please.

423
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,420
我采访了多位总统政策顾问
I've spoken to a number of the president's policy advisors,

424
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,920
他们说经济团队在这项就业计划
who say there's been a lot of disagreement on the economic team

425
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,490
该采取何种形式方面有很多分歧
as to exactly what form this jobs package should take.

426
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,290
-哪些顾问  -想得美
- Which advisors? - Nice try.

427
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,410
我要说明  这并不仅仅是一项就业计划
To be clear, this is far more than just a jobs package.

428
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,800
是一项全面的计划
It is a comprehensive plan,

429
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,430
其目的是两年内实现全面就业
which aims at full employment within two years.

430
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,840
就此而言  还有很多细节问题有待解决
So as such, there are a lot of details to be worked out.

431
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,500
所以你的消息来源不准确
So your sources are inaccurate.

432
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,790
并非是什么分歧
It's not so much a disagreement

433
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,610
而是就计划细节进行辩论  杰西
as it is debating the finer points of the plan. Jess.

434
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,060
我想再追问一句  都有些什么细节问题
Just to follow up. What are some of the finer points?

435
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,340
甚至是计划大致是如何
Or the broad strokes, even.

436
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,240
白宫没有任何人透露任何信息
No one from the White House has said anything.

437
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,150
等我们能拿出计划  我们就会拿出来
When we have a plan to present, we will present it.

438
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,570
杰西
Jess?

439
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,090
《美国就业法案》是否是
Is America Works a reaction

440
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,280
针对总统低支持率的举措
to the president's low approval ratings?

441
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,010
为给竞选造势  而向民众展现政绩
An effort to offer some sign of progress ramping up to the elections?

442
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,760
我们从第一天就开始准备这项法案了
We've been working on this plan since day one.

443
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,300
这与支持率毫无关系
It has nothing to do with the approval ratings.

444
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,980
但至于选举  今天该谁问了
But as for the election... uh, whose turn is it to ask today?

445
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,330
-马克  -总统会参加2016年竞选吗
- Mark? - Is the president running in 2016?

446
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,620
今天  重点是好好执政  但是...
Today, the priority is good government, but...

447
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,370
明天接着问吧
Ask me again tomorrow.

448
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,960
谢谢大家
Thank you, everyone.

449
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,920
10点钟有个空窗
We've got a window at ten.

450
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,190
我这就打给他
I'll call him now.

451
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,120
请坐
Please, sit down.

452
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,980
约翰  萨曼莎
John. Samantha.

453
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,900
你们跟记者说我们这屋里出现的分歧了吗
You spoke to a journalist about disagreements in this room?

454
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,140
再发生一次  你们就走人吧
If that happens again, you're off the team.

455
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,440
说到这屋里出现的分歧
And speaking of the disagreements in this room,

456
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,780
我们现在出现了更大的分歧
we now have an even bigger one,

457
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,710
雷米给我看了你们目前的成果
because Remy has shown me your work so far and...

458
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,110
无力
it's toothless.

459
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,660
我三个月前站在这间屋子里
I stood in this room three months ago

460
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,640
给你们下达了明确的指令
and gave you all very clear direction.

461
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,570
社会保险  医疗保险  医疗补助
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,

462
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,420
所有这些在吸干国库的福利项目
every entitlement program that is sucking us dry,

463
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,380
全都放在桌上
I want it all on the table.

464
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,050
这还远远不够
And this doesn't go nearly far enough.

465
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,670
所以我们显然是得回到一些基本问题上了
So we obviously have to get back to some basics.

466
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,560
回顾一些摆在我们面前的事实
Remind ourselves of some of the facts that are before us--

467
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,010
-先生  我能...  -不不不
- Sir, if I may-- - No, no, no, no.

468
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,800
我先说  然后你再说  保罗
I will speak first, and then you will speak, Paul.

469
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,100
这是国民一年平均从福利项目
This is what the average senior citizen gets,

470
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,700
得到的数额
one year from entitlements,

471
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,390
不管是清洁工  还是对冲基金经理
whether they were a janitor or they ran a hedge fund.

472
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,320
这笔钱  就是一份
That-- This money is a job

473
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,120
我们本可给一位单身母亲
we could be giving to a single mother

474
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,550
或应届毕业生的工作
or a student just out of school.

475
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,870
现在呢
Now, at the moment,

476
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,600
每一元的税中有44美分流向了这些项目
44 cents of every tax dollar goes to pay for these programs.

477
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,820
到2030年  就将超过一半  62美分
By 2030, it'll be over half, 62 cents.

478
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,600
福利项目在让国家破产
Entitlements are bankrupting us.

479
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,190
我让雷米进行了一项民调
Now, I had Remy conduct a little poll.

480
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,350
提出陈述为  "做对国家有益的事
Statement posed was: "Doing what's best for my country

481
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,280
等于做我不喜欢的事"
means doing some things that I don't like."

482
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,050
74%的人认同这一陈述
Seventy-four percent agreed with this statement.

483
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,580
74%  这说明什么
Seventy-four percent. Now, what does that tell us?

484
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,570
我们必须做人们不会喜欢的事
We have to do the things that people won't like.

485
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,830
即便我们做了
And even when we do,

486
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,870
也会有四分之三的人支持我们
three out of four of them will go along with us.

487
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,470
为什么  因为我们能保证就业
And why? Because we're promising jobs.

488
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,310
再说一遍  我们要在哪三个领域
And again, where are the three areas

489
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,900
创造就业呢
that we're gonna be creating these jobs from?

490
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,430
州和联邦基础建设项目
Infrastructure at the state and federal level.

491
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,600
扩大军队
Increasing the size of the military,

492
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,930
并与私营部门合作
and working with our friends in the private sector to start--

493
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,860
抱歉  先生  我必须打断
I'm sorry, sir, but I have to interrupt.

494
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,940
你要削减或砍掉的项目
The programs that you want to scale back or dismantle

495
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,530
是美国梦的基石啊
are the bedrock of the American dream.

496
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,180
工作努力  交税
You work hard, you pay your taxes--

497
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,180
不  抱歉  那曾是美国梦的基石
No, I'm sorry, they were the bedrock of the American dream.

498
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,740
但现在不是了
But they're not anymore.

499
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,870
尤其是对那失业的一千万人来说
Certainly not for the ten million people who are out of work.

500
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,420
但从实际角度出发  数千特殊利益群体
But practically speaking, a thousand special interests,

501
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,810
工会  两党都有反对声音
organized labor, opposition in both parties.

502
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,770
我们可以就你的提议折中一下...
Now, we can do a version of what you're proposing--

503
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,270
我不要折中
I don't want a version.

504
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,120
我要远大愿景
I want a vision.

505
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,680
作为团队领袖  我认为我可以代表所有人说
As head of this team, and I think I speak for everyone,

506
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,140
-我们已经...  -作为总统
- we have done-- - Speaking as the president,

507
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,020
我选择了这支团队  你们为我工作
who chose this team and for whom it works,

508
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,650
我要拿到五千亿美元
I want five hundred billion dollars

509
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,890
给一千万民众工作
to put ten million people to work.

510
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,860
我不管这多让人肉疼
I don't care how much it hurts.

511
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,350
我不管这有多具争议性
I don't care how controversial it is.

512
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,020
你们的职责  就是找出办法
Your job is to find a way.

513
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,190
说服国会和美国人民是我的工作
It's my job to convince Congress and the American people.

514
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,230
你们的工作不是向我推销你们的妥协方案
Your job is not to sell me on your version of my program.

515
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,840
大家都清楚自己该做什么了吗
Now, are we all clear on what our jobs are?

516
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,890
很好  因为我要在30天内
Good, because I want to present this proposal

517
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,020
向领导层呈递这份提议
to leadership in 30 days.

518
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
-我们实现这个目标吧  -保罗
- Let's make it happen. - Paul?

519
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,100
-我们不再需要你了  -什么
- Your services are no longer needed. - Excuse me?

520
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,000
别声张  保持和气
Let's keep it quiet, let's keep it cordial.

521
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,240
-多谢你的辛劳  -我去收拾东西
- Thanks for all your work. - I'll get my things.

522
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,600
我会叫人给你送到大厅的
I'll have them sent down to you in the lobby.

523
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,140
喂
Hello?

524
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,350
好的  马上就来
Yeah. I'm on my way.

525
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,470
天啊
God!

526
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,780
天啊
God!

527
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,860
请您稍等几分钟  请坐
It'll be a few minutes. Please, have a seat.

528
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
-你知道多久了  -两个月
- How long have you known? - Two months.

529
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,380
我作为法官的能力尚未受到影响
It hasn't impaired my judgment on the bench.

530
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,350
而且目前只是早期
And it's early on.

531
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,520
还要一段时间才会有一些明显的症状
We don't expect any real symptoms for quite some time.

532
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,390
暂时我还不会穿着
I won't be wandering around the Supreme Court

533
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,890
短裤在最高法院乱晃
in my boxer shorts anytime soon.

534
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,070
但是我想现在就趁早退休  别到那一步
But I'd like to retire now, long before we get there.

535
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,860
大法官  我非常感谢你能有勇气来
Well, Justice, I want to thank you for having the courage

536
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,030
告知我这个消息
to come and share this news with me.

537
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,090
你确定诊断无误吗
Are you sure the diagnosis is correct?

538
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,400
我的医生就是给副总统夫人看病的那位
My doctor's the same that treated the Vice President's wife.

539
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,870
他是美国最厉害的老年痴呆专家
He's the foremost Alzheimer's specialist in America.

540
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,320
是的  我任命唐纳德为副总统了
Yes, I made Donald my vice president.

541
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,150
与其让他在国会惹事  不如放在身边
I'd rather him be a pain in my ass here than over in Congress.

542
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,200
而且就算是共和党员
And even the Republicans

543
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,350
也不能拒绝刚刚经历丧妻之痛的人
couldn't refuse a man who just buried his wife.

544
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,340
玛乔莉走得这么快真是可怕
Terrible how quickly Marjory went.

545
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,320
我现在就告诉你
I'm telling you this now

546
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,580
这样你就有时间考虑一下人选
so you have time to think about candidates

547
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,050
然后我再宣布退休
before I announce my retirement.

548
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,450
-你能给我多长时间  -你需要多长时间
- How much time can you give me? - How much do you need?

549
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,870
我正要向国会提出《美国就业法案》
I'm about to introduce America Works to Congress.

550
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,470
肯定不会轻松
It's sure to be an uphill battle.

551
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,330
还是不要再加个最高法院法官提名来添乱了
And I'd prefer not to add a Supreme Court nomination to the mix.

552
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,420
共和党肯定会拿这个当筹码
The Republicans will just use it as leverage.

553
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,830
我听到了一些风声  要拿福利开刀吗
I've heard rumblings. Entitlements on the chopping block?

554
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,710
所以更需要你继续坐镇
All the more reason to keep you on the bench.

555
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,930
司法部肯定会提出异议
It's sure to be challenged in the Judiciary.

556
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,630
总统先生  我想和我妻子
Mr. President, I want to spend as much time

557
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,830
尽量多在一起
with my wife as possible

558
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,350
趁着我这两年还清醒
in the good years that I have left.

559
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,780
玛乔莉确诊的时候  她也是这么想的
When Marjory was ill, she wanted the same thing.

560
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,770
她离开了史密森尼学会  但是你知道吗
She left the Smithsonian, and you know what?

561
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,350
她在家每一秒都很烦躁  因为不能做事了
She hated every second of being at home, of not being productive,

562
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,240
不能从事自己热爱的事业
of not doing what she loved.

563
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,360
她那段时间过得很艰难
It made her time with us much harder, and...

564
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,860
也非常不开心
it made her deeply unhappy.

565
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,450
工作是最好的调剂  我真希望她当时没退休
Work is the best distraction. I wish she hadn't retired.

566
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,500
而且  她头脑还清楚的时候
And, uh... before she lost her lucid thought,

567
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,240
她说她也很后悔
she said she regretted it, too.

568
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,240
能不能再坚持六个月  最多一年
Can you give me six months? A year at the most? That's all.

569
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,640
让我在应付最高法院的争斗之前
Just enough time to get this program up and running

570
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,850
能有时间让这个法案顺利开展
before I have to face a Supreme Court fight.

571
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,210
-我得考虑考虑  -当然
- I need to think it over. - Oh, of course.

572
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,430
-和你夫人商量一下  -我送你出去
- Speak to your wife. - I'll walk you out.

573
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,830
-研究中心尽快给我落实  -说话算话
- I better get that research center. - Yes, a deal is a deal.

574
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,130
上帝啊  唐纳德  咱们赶紧干活儿吧
Now, good God, Donald, let's get something done.

575
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,420
现在你知道为什么唐纳德会同意了
Now you see why Donald said yes.

576
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,030
他虽恨我入骨
He may hate my guts,

577
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,260
但是再没什么比家庭成员去世
but there's nothing like a death in the family

578
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,270
更能让人识时务了
to separate the wheat from the bullshit.

579
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,780
让他进来吧
Send him in.

580
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,600
是  先生
Yes, sir.

581
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,600
总统可以见你了
The president is ready to see you now.

582
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,060
道格
Doug.

583
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,410
总统先生
Mr. President.

584
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,030
医生告诉我你恢复得很好
The doctor told me your recovery is going very well.

585
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,630
是啊  就是要用这个
Yeah. Well, there's this.

586
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,190
别的地方都恢复如初
But everything else is as good as new.

587
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,980
见到你真是太好了
It's great to see you.

588
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,000
克莱尔和我担心得要死
Claire and I have been worried sick about you.

589
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,200
谢谢你们的礼物
Thank you for the gifts.

590
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,840
也谢谢你们的照顾
For looking out for me.

591
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,900
我没多少亲密的朋友  你是其中之一
I don't have that many close friends. I count you among them.

592
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,490
我很感激你这么说  先生
I appreciate your saying that, sir.

593
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,640
别叫我先生  我们是老朋友了
Oh, drop the "Sir." We're old pals.

594
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,760
嗯
Well...

595
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,010
我才应该道歉
I'm the one who should apologize.

596
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,100
你又给了我个机会  你相信我
You gave me another chance. You trusted me.

597
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,360
这一切我一人承担
And what happened, I take responsibility for that.

598
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,760
让你陷入那种处境
No, for putting you in that position.

599
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,260
别  没这必要
Stop. It's not necessary.

600
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,760
-我让你身陷危机  -没错  但我只在乎
- I endangered you just as-- - Yeah, but all I care about

601
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,760
你还活着  在逐渐恢复
is that you are alive and getting better.

602
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,560
其它的都过去吧
Let the rest of it go.

603
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,140
-你知道我多忠心  -这不用你说
- You know how devoted I am. - You don't have to say it.

604
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,280
你一次又一次地证明了自己
You proved it time and time again.

605
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,810
来  坐下
Now, come on, come on, sit down.

606
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,040
坐在这儿
Right here.

607
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,180
当初有机会时我就该解决了她
I should've taken care of her when I had the chance.

608
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,810
我还没找到她
I haven't found her yet.

609
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,830
等我找到她  一定确保别人再找不到
But when I do, I'll make sure that no one else does.

610
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,220
我向你保证  先生
You can count on that, sir.

611
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,180
你打算怎么办...
How is it, uh...?

612
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,320
我不告诉你可能比较好
Probably better if we don't talk about it.

613
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,960
嗯  是啊
Right, of course.

614
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,240
他们说你要见我
Well, they told me you needed to see me.

615
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,100
先生  我知道这要求很过分
Well, sir, I... I know that it's a lot to ask,

616
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,680
我给我们惹了这么大麻烦
and that I probably don't deserve it,

617
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,470
我或许也不配
considering the mess I put us in.

618
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,790
你肯定也有顾虑
And I'm sure you have your doubts.

619
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,970
我知道我不能明目张胆  但...
I realize it couldn't be anything too visible, but...

620
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,560
我一直在跟进《美国就业法案》的报道
I've been following everything with America Works.

621
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,200
这扯哪去了
Well, that's a ways off.

622
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,720
我觉得我能帮上忙
But I was thinking that I could help.

623
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,680
游说委员会领导层应该有明确目标
There should be a targeted plan for lobbying committee leadership.

624
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,470
我能配合政治团队
And I can work with the political team,

625
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,030
协调国会立法主任和幕僚长
coordinate with House leg directors, chiefs of staff--

626
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,600
我昨天去了加夫尼给我父亲扫墓
I was in Gaffney yesterday, visiting my father's grave.

627
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,200
他从不好好照顾自己
He never took care of himself.

628
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,890
不顾自己心脏有病  最终付出代价
He ignored his heart problems and... he paid the price.

629
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,750
你得尊重自己终有一死的命运  道格
You have to respect your own mortality, Doug.

630
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,060
我不想给你收尸
I don't want to be standing over your grave.

631
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,230
告诉你...
Now, look...

632
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,630
我保证你在这里会有一席之地
There is a place for you here, I promise.

633
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,080
但心急吃不了热豆腐
But we have to go about this slowly.

634
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,790
我在家工作  只跟你和雷米直接接触
I'll work from home. Only direct contact with you or Remy.

635
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,460
要知道你帮我的最好办法
You know the way that you can help me the best

636
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,400
就是好好恢复身体
is to do exactly what you're doing right now,

637
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,250
不要分心
focusing on your recovery.

638
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,730
如果我操之过急
I would never forgive myself

639
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,910
让你压力太大  我绝不会原谅自己
if I put too much on your plate too soon.

640
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,690
没错
You're right.

641
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,900
抱歉
I'm sorry.

642
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,360
谢谢
Thank you.

643
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,900
抱歉  我得走了
I'm sorry, I have to go.

644
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,420
但我说的都是真心话
But look, I meant what I said.

645
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,760
等你准备好了再说
When you are truly ready.

646
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,200
是  先生
Yes, sir.

647
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,540
你想待多久待多久
Stay as long as you like.

648
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,990
三小时前  我们定位到
Three hours ago, we pinpointed him here,

649
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,940
他在也门的夏卜瓦省
in the Shabwa region of Yemen.

650
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,630
配合方面呢
Cooperation?

651
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,010
我几分钟前和外交部长谈过
I spoke to the foreign minister a few minutes ago.

652
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,280
-有多少平民  -二十几个  不明身份
- Civilians? - Two dozen, non-IDs.

653
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,460
太多了
That's too many.

654
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,730
我们担心他可能随时离开
Our concern is that he could be on the move at any moment.

655
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,520
先生  鉴于佩特罗夫要来华盛顿...
Sir, with Petrov coming to Washington--

656
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,150
我们花了两年才找到阿卜杜拉
It's taken us two years to track Abdullah down.

657
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,220
不能为了峰会就放弃一切机会
We can't ignore every opportunity between now and the summit.

658
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,990
你们看到村子情况了吗
Do you have eyes on the village?

659
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,830
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

660
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,750
他就在这栋房子里
He's in this building here.

661
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,150
50米内不留活口
Kill zone is anyone within 50 meters.

662
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,620
如果没有平民伤亡就能除掉他
If we take him out with no civilian casualties,

663
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,840
我就同意这次袭击
I'll authorize the strike.

664
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,460
先生  恕我冒昧  我真心认为
Sir, if I may, I really think--

665
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,830
还有不到两个月佩特罗夫总统就将来访华盛顿
President Petrov is coming to Washington in less than two months.

666
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,500
我们整个中东政策都靠这次峰会
Our entire Middle East policy hinges on that meeting.

667
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,940
如果可能  我们不想给穆斯林社会任何
We don't want to give the Muslim community any viable reasons

668
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,250
阻挠进程的借口
to obstruct things if we can avoid it.

669
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,880
想办法不杀死平民就除掉他
So find a way to do this without killing civilians.

670
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,200
非常感谢各位
Thank you all very much.

671
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,750
能单独谈会儿吗  是克莱尔的事
May I have a moment? It's about Claire.

672
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,780
如果你丈夫提名你  我不会手下留情的
If your husband nominates you, I can't pull any punches.

673
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,070
没经验  任人唯亲
Lack of experience. Nepotism.

674
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,080
没错
That's right.

675
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,490
你觉得我太业余
And you think I'm a dilettante.

676
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,450
不  但很多人会这么认为
No. But plenty of people will.

677
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:46,540
打从弗兰西斯一就职我就在准备了
I've been preparing since Francis took office.

678
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,600
经验的缺乏我会用职业道德补上
What I lack in experience I'll make up for in work ethic.

679
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,740
为什么要当联合国大使
Why Ambassador to the UN?

680
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,820
你作为第一夫人有更大的影响力
You wield far more influence as the First Lady.

681
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,960
那和切实地去做贡献不一样
That's not the same as contributing in a concrete way.

682
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,370
如果我们投票否决了你
If we vote down your confirmation,

683
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:03,580
你能接受在公众面前丢面子吗
are you comfortable with that sort of public embarrassment?

684
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,590
我知道有这风险
I know that's a risk.

685
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,750
-你2016年会竞选吧  -无可奉告
- You're running in 2016, right? - No comment.

686
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,480
弗兰西斯和我都惊讶于
Francis and I are impressed

687
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,720
共和党人如此支持你
by how the Republicans are consolidating around you.

688
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,280
你会是一个优秀的候选人
You'll make a good candidate.

689
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,820
但不能和总统夫人勾结
Not by linking arms with the president's wife.

690
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:25,370
如果我搞砸了  这会是有力的竞选广告
If I'm a disaster, it makes for a good campaign ad.

691
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,130
如果我做得好  那你更是无可指摘
If I do a good job, nobody can fault you.

692
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:31,160
无论如何这都不会影响你2016的竞选
Either way, it doesn't hurt your chances in 2016.

693
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:37,260
我很感激你在公布消息前先来找我
Well, I appreciate you coming by before going public.

694
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,320
很有风度也很周到
It is classy, and thoughtful.

695
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,920
我不会故意阻碍你的
I won't actively block you.

696
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,630
剩下就靠你自己努力了
The rest is on your shoulders.

697
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:48,020
谢谢  参议员
Thank you, Senator.

698
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,240
告诉总统我这么做是出于对你的敬意
Tell the president I'm doing this out of respect to you.

699
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,460
我在普选上打败弗兰克前  他都会在我黑名单上
Frank's still on my shit list till I beat him in the general.

700
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,560
好的
I will.

701
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,650
你怎么不立刻过来
Why didn't you come right away?

702
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,240
我有个会面不能错过
I had a meeting I couldn't miss.

703
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,880
该死的华盛顿
Fucking Washington.

704
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,530
-会有些疼  -我知道
- This is gonna hurt. - I know.

705
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,550
这是扑热息痛  能止痛
Here's some Percocet. It'll help with the pain.

706
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,850
我给你开个30天的处方
I'll write you a 30-day prescription.

707
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:17,970
我不能
I can't.

708
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,470
-我不能...  -什么
- I'm not supposed to-- - What was that?

709
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:24,470
没事
Nothing.

710
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,170
好了  你可以走了
All right. You're good to go.

711
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,470
-和门多萨谈得如何  -我觉得还不错
- How did it go with Mendoza? - Well, I think.

712
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,700
他会支持你吗
He'll support you?

713
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,090
他不会公开反对
He won't openly fight it.

714
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,940
那可以一大进步
Well, that is a big step forward.

715
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,730
-道格说了什么  -没什么新消息
- How did it go with Doug? - No real news.

716
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,410
你今晚还要在这里睡吗
Hey, are you in here again tonight?

717
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,340
我感冒还没好  不想传染给你
I'm still getting over this cold. I don't want to get you sick.

718
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,140
好吧  别做事做得太晚了
Well, don't stay up with all that too late.

719
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,190
弗兰西斯
Francis?

720
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,490
我们什么时候公布提名
When do we announce the nomination?

721
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,780
听着  我今晚本来不想谈这事
Listen, I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight,

722
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,410
可你得知道国务院那边
but you should know that there are some serious doubts

723
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,370
有很多疑虑
from people at the State Department.

724
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,110
你是说凯茜
You mean Cathy.

725
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,450
还有她的一些手下
And some on her staff.

726
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:00,730
什么样的疑虑
Like what?

727
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,660
就是"能力不足""身兼两职"之类的
Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.

728
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,750
你是不是不想这么做了才这么说
And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?

729
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,870
当然不是  我告诉你  是希望你完全明白
Not at all. I'm sharing with you so you fully understand

730
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:12,260
你要面对的情况
what you're getting into.

731
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,790
我明白
And I do.

732
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,590
或许我们不该着急
Maybe we shouldn't rush this.

733
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,890
-你现在也有疑虑了  -我可没这么说
- You're having doubts now, too. - I didn't say that.

734
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,690
只是你该多考虑考虑这么做
Only you should put more thought into whether

735
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,300
是否对你合适  就是这样
this is the right move for you. That's all.

736
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,550
晚安  弗兰西斯
Good night, Francis.

737
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,450
早日康复
Feel better.

738
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,730
弗兰西斯
Francis.

739
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,510
我想你这周宣布提名的消息
I want you to announce the nomination this week.

740
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,690
我不想等了  没有什么好时机
I don't want to wait. The timing will never be good.

741
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,830
我明明能积攒实战经验
And I don't want to waste time

742
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,320
何必要浪费时间呢
when I can be getting real experience under my belt.

743
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,250
定个日子举办新闻发布会吧
So set a date, hold a press conference, and let's do it.

744
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,810
克莱尔
Claire!

745
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:19,370
我提到凯茜并不是说我认为
I was not trying to suggest that you not be the ambassador

746
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,700
你不该当大使  我只是...
when I brought up Cathy. I was just--

747
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,310
我们早说好了
We made a deal,

748
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,150
现在你却要食言了
and now you're trying to back away from it.

749
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,070
-不是这样的  -那你就会告诉凯茜
- That is not true. - Then you would've told Cathy

750
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,190
事情就是这样  让她接受
it's happening to make her peace with that.

751
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,080
-没那么简单  -就是那么简单
- It's not that simple. - Yes, it is.

752
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,090
-你是总统  -我不能控制国会
- You're the president. - I can't control Congress.

753
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,660
我想启动两项重要项目
I'm trying to get two major initiatives off the ground

754
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,910
我的每一步行动都将产生影响
and every move I make will have an effect.

755
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,440
我们早在走进白宫之前就已经说定了
We agreed to this before we ever stepped foot in this house.

756
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,360
-我知道我们说定了  -如果我没有
- I know what we agreed to. - How am I supposed to run for office

757
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,300
令人信服的资历  日后我怎么竞选总统
at some point if I don't have a legitimate track record?

758
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,630
我们必须撑过接下来这18个月
We have to survive the next 18 months,

759
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,170
取得点成绩  再说后面的事
accomplish something, and then look ahead.

760
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,370
弗兰西斯  我们还是现实一点
Francis, let's be realistic.

761
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,280
你能否当选总统完全是没准的事
There's no guarantee you'll get elected.

762
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:06,750
如果你落选  我得有所准备
I need to be prepared if you don't.

763
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,520
你对我还真是有信心啊
You have that much faith in me, do you?

764
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,440
看来比你对我的信心要大
More faith than you have in me, it seems.

765
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,540
我相信你胜过任何人  克莱尔
I believe in you more than anyone, Claire.

766
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,110
那表现出来  提名我
Then show it. Nominate me.

767
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,260
别让我再费口舌说服你
I shouldn't have to convince you.

768
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,010
不是说不说服的事
It's not about convincing.

769
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:20,070
而是我们得看清当下的政治气候
It's about being honest about the political climate

770
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,910
-我们现在的处境  -我快要年过半百了
- that we find ourselves-- - I'm almost 50 years old.

771
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,910
几十年来我一直当你的贤内助
I've been in the passenger seat for decades.

772
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,720
也该让我自主一回了
It's time for me to get behind the wheel.

773
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,340
必须现在就开始着手  赶在大选之前
That needs to start now. Before the election.

774
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,470
因为谁知道那时会发生什么
Because who knows what will happen?

775
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,970
万一你输了呢
What if you lose?

776
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,540
我不会只当个填座总统的  克莱尔
I will not be a placeholder president, Claire.

777
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:48,320
我一定会赢  我会名垂青史
I will win. And I will leave a legacy.

778
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,170
你是说我们会名垂青史
You mean we will.

779
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,240
打扰了  先生
Excuse me, sir.

780
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,910
国防部长来电  他说有要事
The Secretary of Defense is on the line. He says it's urgent.

781
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,210
什么事
Yes?

782
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,300
好的
Okay.

783
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,100
我这就去
I'm coming.

784
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,950
等我到了再开始
Not until I get there.

785
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,060
-我马上下去  -好的  先生
- I'll be right down. - Yes, sir.

786
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,320
穿好衣服  我有东西要给你看
Get dressed. I want you to see something.

787
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,330
进来
Come in.

788
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,420
-给  -多谢
- Here. - Thank you.

789
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:33,460
那好
Okay, great.

790
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,400
去脱吧
Get undressed.

791
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,030
这是怎么回事
How did this happen?

792
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:37,850
不重要
Doesn't matter.

793
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,830
我来帮你
Let me help you.

794
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,150
让我来
I'll... I'll do it.

795
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,410
我会小心的
I'll be gentle.

796
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,150
不用小心
Don't be gentle.

797
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,770
像这样吗
Like that?

798
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,210
没错
Yeah.

799
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,410
-搞什么鬼  -是波本
- What the fuck? - It's bourbon.

800
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,840
-我  -只是波本而已
- I-- - That's all. It's just bourbon.

801
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,020
-拿着  -我真不想
- Take it. - I really don't want to.

802
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,680
不是用来注射的
Nothing's going through the skin.

803
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,350
我只是想让你
I just want you to squirt it...

804
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:56,630
把酒射进我嘴里
into my mouth.

805
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,700
好吗  拜托了
Okay? Please.

806
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,700
-那是目标吗  -是的  先生
- Is that our target? - Yes, sir.

807
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,300
总统先生  这次行动是高度机密
Mr. President, this is a highly classified operation--

808
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,530
我授权第一夫人在场旁观行动
I'm clearing the First Lady for this operation.

809
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,540
好的  请原谅  先生
Yes, sir. Forgive me, sir.

810
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,450
随时准备发射  先生
We are armed and ready, sir.

811
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:25,780
阿卜杜拉就在那些车辆中
Abdullah is in one of those vehicles.

812
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,070
具体哪一辆我们还不清楚
We can't tell which one.

813
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,800
如果他们兵分三路行动的话
If they go in three different directions,

814
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,980
我们将不知道该摧毁哪一路
we wouldn't know where to strike,

815
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,820
如果让他逃回山中
and if he makes it back to the mountains,

816
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,780
我们的卫星就追踪不到他了
we'll lose our satellite track on him.

817
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,570
那些是孩子吗
Are those children?

818
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,930
我不能确定  先生  但有这个可能
I can't say definitely, sir, but they could be.

819
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,240
可以发动打击吗  先生
Do we have authorization, sir?

820
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,900
-行动吧  -执行打击
- Proceed. - Proceed with the launch.

821
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,570
倒计时10秒
And ten seconds.

822
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:59,970
And five, four, three...

823
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,610
目标已摧毁  先生
Target is destroyed, sir.

824
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,750
谢谢各位
Thank you, everyone.

825
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,400
我还是要提名
I still want it.

826
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:44,920
那好吧
All right.

827
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
那好吧
All right.

829
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:33,930
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2011年夏天  美国总统奥巴马同国会就"债务上限"展开激烈争斗
在谈判中最终败给国会新当选的一批共和党保守派"茶党"的议员
共和党取得了谈判胜利
"债务上限"一役使奥巴马民望大跌  不仅反对派共和党对他不以为然
民主党内也有很多人认为他缺乏领导能力
为挽回民望和政治影响力
奥巴马于2011年9月8日在国会发表全国性讲话
郑重推出《美国工作法案》(American Jobs Act)
该法案拟在不增加预算赤字的情况下
通过不同渠道筹款四千四百七十亿美元  用于创造就业

831
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:58,930
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}然而该法案推出后  不仅遭到国会共和党的强烈反对
在民主党占多数的参议院也没得到足够的支持
由于无法在国会得到通过  白宫被迫将这个法案分拆成几个小法案
但是即使委曲求全  分拆后的法案也大都没通过
