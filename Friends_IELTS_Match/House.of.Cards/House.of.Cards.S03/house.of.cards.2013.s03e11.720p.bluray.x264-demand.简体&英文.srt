Fifty-five years.

你叫什么  女士

是啊  没错
Yes. Yes, I do.

35
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,190
弗兰西斯和我的婚姻才到那一半的年头
Well, Francis and I are only halfway there,

36
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,590
但我打赌你对你丈夫就像对自己一样了解
but I bet you know your husband as well as you know yourself.

-我说得对吗  -对  是这样
- Am I right? - Yes, I do.

Well, I know Francis Underwood.

39

我知道什么让他夜不能寐
I know what keeps him up at night.

40
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,710
我确信那原因跟你们的丈夫一样
And I'm sure it's the same thing that keeps your husbands up, too.

41
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,030
是未来  我要怎么给家庭带来更美好的未来
The future. How can I ensure a better future for my family?

42
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,830
但是  弗兰西斯  作为总统...
Except... Francis, as President...

43
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,780
他的关注着全美国的家庭
his focus is on the progress of all American families.

44
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,370
你们知道他昨晚跟我说什么吗
You know what he said to me last night?

45
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,800
他说"克莱尔  我整个总统工作目标很简单
He said, "Claire, my entire presidential agenda, it's very simple.

46
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,640
我想看着每一个美国人的眼睛
I want to be able to look every single American in the eye,

47
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,010
知道自己让他们过得更好了"
and know that I have made their lives better."

48
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,540
请讲
Yes.

49
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,010
我得说  安德伍德夫人
I have to say, Mrs. Underwood,

50
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,930
我觉得您很有魅力
I find you very charming.

51
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,260
看起来也很诚实
And you seem quite honest.

52
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,620
但我无法相信
But I have trouble believing

53
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,160
您丈夫真的关心人民
that your husband truly cares about people.

54
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,990
弗兰西斯·安德伍德是个好人
Well, Francis Underwood is a good man.

55
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,680
他甘于奉献  慷慨大方
He's dedicated and generous.

56
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,430
我有28年的亲身经历为证
And I have 28 years of proof.

57
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,520
而且我可以说  即使我没嫁给他
And I can honestly say, even if I wasn't married to him,

58
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,700
也会投票给他
he would definitely have my vote.

59
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,860
谢谢你
Thank you.

60
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,390
渎职  任人唯亲
Negligence. Nepotism.

61
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,210
侵吞联邦基金
Misappropriation of federal funds.

62
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,250
外交政策失败  还有隐瞒事实

63
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,470

What do these five fingers have in common?

64
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,480
弗兰西斯·J·安德伍德
Francis J. Underwood.

65
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,570
金先生  我想回应一下
Mr. King, I would like to respond to that.

66
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,160
此人藐视法律
This is a man who believes in the rule of law-ish.

67
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,950
不顾立法程序  罔顾宪法
The legislative process-ish. The Constitution-ish.

68
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,140
这样的人应该当总统吗
Is this the man who should be president?

69
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,140
邓巴女士  你像个好律师那样
Ms. Dunbar, like any good lawyer,

70
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,100
有绝佳的辞令
you have a knack for rhetoric-ish.

71
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,140
但美国人民听够空话了
But the American people are tired of words.

72
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,590
他们渴望的是实际行动
What they crave is action.

73
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,300
我担心我强调"行动"这个词
My concern about focusing on the word, "action,"

74
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,430
她会用失败的行动回击
is that she'll just come back with failed actions.

75
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,220
《美国就业法案》  联合国维和任务
America Works, the UN mission.

76
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,910
"行动"在上轮民调的关键人群中反响不错
"Action" performed well with key demos in our last poll.

77
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,110
是  但这不会偏离主题吗
Yes, but doesn't this take us off message?

78
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,120
我们一直说  "支持弗兰克·安德伍德
We have been saying, "A vote for Frank Underwood

79
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,340
就是支持《美国就业法案》"
is a vote for America Works."

80
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,150
我们一直在宣传那个
That's what we've been running on.

81
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,400
你得找一个比《美国就业法案》更广的词
You need a word that goes beyond America Works.

82
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,050
任何情况都能用的
Something that can be used for anything.

83
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,440
雷米  你怎么看
Remy, what do you think?

84
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,320
我们在讨论"行动"这个词
We're talking about the word, "action."

85
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,540
抱歉  我刚刚...
Sorry, I was, uh...

86
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,100
我在想外交政策的论点
my mind was on the foreign policy argument.

87
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,420
-我想提前考虑好  -"愿景"怎么样
- I was just thinking ahead. - What about "vision"?

88
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,340
不会太泛泛了吗
Isn't that too generic?

89
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,210
就是这目的啊  越概括越好
That's what we want. I mean, the more generic, the better.

90
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,070
人们可以把任何事投射到"愿景"上
People can project anything they want on "vision."

91
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,920
我明天之前做好民调
I'll get it polled before tomorrow.

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,420
下面该准备与夏普的辩论了
We should work on Sharp next.

93
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,820
要我扮她吗
You want me to play her?

94
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,590
谢谢你这么认真地扮演  唐纳德
Thank you for taking your role so seriously, Donald.

95
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,340
你应该考虑当演员
You should consider a career on the stage.

96
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,830
因为他是别想跟我竞选了
Because he sure as hell isn't gonna be on my ticket.

97
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,660
你做这个很厉害  她们都喜欢你
You're good at this. They loved you.

98
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,370
竞选三十年  就知道怎么观察听众了
Three decades of campaigns, you learn how to read an audience.

99
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,060
我受不了自我推销
Self-promotion gives me hives.

100
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,560
真不知道你怎么做到的
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.

101
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,630
我是在推销我丈夫  不是我自己
I'm promoting my husband, not myself.

102
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,500
这借口真方便啊
That's a convenient way to spin it, don't you think?

103
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,860
你说话一向这么直白吗
Are you always this blunt?

104
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,860
我只能再随行两天了
I only have two days to tag along.

105
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,200
介意我跟你一车吗  我们时间挺紧的
Mind if I ride with you, since we have so little time?

106
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,160
我得打几个电话  也许以后吧
I need to make some calls. Maybe we'll find some time later.

107
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,880
雷米  你之前走神了  怎么回事
Remy, you were distracted earlier. What's going on?

108
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,250
没什么  一切都好
Nothing. Everything's good.

109
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,290
我需要你拿出最佳表现  雷米
I need you on your A-game, Remy.

110
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,710
这场辩论可能让我们领先
This debate could make us the front-runner.

111
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,260
只是又要竞选  又要管理白宫
It's just between the campaign and managing the White House,

112
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,970
我有点精疲力尽了
I'm a little burnt out.

113
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,140
我们还有好几个月要忙  普选前还有一年
We still have months to go. A year before the general.

114
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,760
只是暂时的  我会好起来
It's temporary. I'll get past it.

115
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,180
你能做到  我也能
If you can do it, I can.

116
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,360
嘉文
Gavin?

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,490
-你好  道格拉斯  -你想怎么样
- Hello, Douglas. - What do you want?

118
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,440
你还是不肯相信她死了  对吗
You still can't believe she's dead, can you?

119
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,300
你不该信  因为她没死
Well, you shouldn't. 'Cause she's not.

120
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,680
她还活着  我知道她的确切住址
She's alive, and I know exactly where she is.

121
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,730
我早就知道了
I've known for a while.

122
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,720
-什么  -看你的电脑
- What? - Look on your laptop.

123
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,160
不可能  你给我看过照片
No, you... you showed me the picture.

124
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,950
-她尸体的照片  -那不是她
- Of her body. - That wasn't her.

125
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,520
全是我伪造的  好让你给我的护照解锁
I forged it all so you'd lift my passport lock.

126
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,250
我已经逃出来了  道格
Well, I'm out now, Doug.

127
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,780
我很安全  但我朋友仍有危险
And I'm safe. But my friend isn't.

128
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,180
去找格林
Talk to Green.

129
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,280
给他拿到跟我一样的协议  撤销所有起诉
Get him the same deal you got me, all charges dropped.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,970
你照做  我就告诉你她在哪
You do that, and I'll tell you where she is.

131
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,040
-密查姆  -先生
- Hey, Meechum. - Sir.

132
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,050
总统先生
Mr. President.

133
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,420
感谢你赶来安德鲁空军基地
Thank you for coming all the way to Andrews.

134
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,770
雷米跟你说过总体方案了吗
Did Remy walk you through the broad strokes?

135
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,870
不论是国际还是国内的政策问题
No matter the policy question, foreign or domestic,

136
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,640
我们都抨击邓巴经验不足
we hammer Dunbar's lack of experience.

137
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,610
要猛烈攻击
We bludgeon it.

138
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,680
尽可能地强调"经验不足"
We cannot say "lack of experience" enough.

139
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,650
毫无疑问  她会提起克莱尔休会任命一事
And no doubt, she'll bring up Claire's recess appointment,

140
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,560
我不能发表看法  所以这个话题就交给你
where I can't take the bait, so I leave that entirely to you.

141
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,250
这正是我想跟你讨论的问题之一
This was one of the things that I was hoping to discuss.

142
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,500
你不想说她性别歧视吗
Oh, you don't want to call her "sexist"?

143
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,720
-这论点站不住脚  -能站住脚
- The argument doesn't hold. - It does hold.

144
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,710
她说克莱尔不胜任那份工作
She says that Claire was unqualified.

145
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,060
你说换了有同样履历的男人她就不会那么说
You say she wouldn't say that about a man with the same CV.

146
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,140
我觉得这未必
I'm not sure that's true.

147
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,860
而且指责另一位女性性别歧视
And calling another woman sexist

148
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,980
特别是台上还有一位男性
when there's a man on the stage--

149
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,750
没有比你更合适的人选
And who else is better but you

150
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,990
指责她在女性问题上
to call her out on what she's done for women,

151
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,590
根本无所作为
which is absolutely nothing?

152
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,570
而通过立法促进性别平等是你的标志之一
Whereas gender-equality legislation is one of your hallmarks.

153
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,860
但这对我的伤害可能远大于对她
But it could hurt me more than it hurts her.

154
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,780
我以为我们已达成共识
I thought we had an understanding.

155
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,350
你咄咄逼人  我保持气度
You were gonna play pit bull while I play presidential.

156
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,930
你会惹火上身吗  对  有可能
Will you get a little bloody? Yes, probably.

157
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,930
但这不就是辩论的目的吗
But that's what people want in their debates.

158
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,550
然后你与我携手  我们一起埋了她
And then you and I together, we bury her.

159
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,370
再下个星期你退选  转而支持我
You drop out next week, endorse me

160
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,610
竞选就此结束
and the race is over.

161
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,800
我不介意当打手
I have no problem being forceful.

162
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,260
但这个性别歧视  还有择校的问题
But this sexism thing, and the whole school argument, I--

163
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,240
你是说她的孩子
You mean her kids.

164
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,900
我真的不想把他们扯进来
I really don't want to involve them.

165
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,000
有两点我们希望美国人民知道
We have two things we want the American people to hear:

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,240
她经验不足
she lacks experience

167
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,070
还有她含着金钥匙出生
and she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.

168
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,610
但肯定还有别的办法
But there has to be another way.

169
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,250
她想鼓吹同一起跑线
She wants to trumpet an equal playing field?

170
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,290
那她为什么还送自己的孩子上私立学校
Then why does she send her own kids to private school?

171
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,410
这是一个简单清晰的观点
That is a clear and simple argument

172
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,160
所有人都能明白
that everyone can get their heads around.

173
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,140
而且加分的是
And it doesn't hurt

174
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,810
爱荷华州最大的雇佣单位就是公立学校系统
that Iowa's biggest employer is the public school system.

175
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,480
艾伦也送他的孩子上私立学校
Alan sends his kids to private school.

176
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,580
对  但他们不是你的孩子
Yeah, but they're not your kids.

177
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,260
我是他们的继母  我会被批为伪君子
They're my step-kids. And that makes me a hypocrite.

178
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,510
这才是你真正在意的吗
Is that really what you're concerned about?

179
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,810
被称为伪君子
Being a hypocrite?

180
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,020
这事关我的家人
It's my family.

181
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,290
相信我  等他们走进白宫
Oh, trust me, they'll understand

182
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,320
就会理解你的
the moment they step into the White House.

183
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,880
杰姬  真不该用我来说服你
Jackie, I really shouldn't have to convince you

184
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,450
为住进那里无所不用其极
to do what it takes to get a set of keys.

185
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,060
我会咄咄逼人的  总统先生
I'll be the pit bull, Mr. President.

186
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,130
谢谢你  杰姬
Thank you, Jackie.

187
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,600
-可以了吗  -媒体已经登机  先生
- Are we all clear? - The press has boarded, sir.

188
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,540
-好  确保没人看到她  -是  先生
- All right, make sure no one sees her. - Yes, sir.

189
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,440
今天飞往得梅因将用时两小时
Flight time to Des Moines today will be two hours...

190
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,520
真是可惜  她的坚决务实
Such a pity how much ruthless pragmatism

191
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,970
被家庭价值观拖了后腿
gets weighed down by family values.

192
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,400
要是没有她那位医生和满脸粉刺的孩子
Without her doctor and his pimply-faced brood,

193
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,680
她本可一飞冲天
she could soar as high as this plane.

194
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,820
我知道让她结婚是我的主意  不用你提醒
Oh, I know, the marriage was my idea. Don't remind me.

195
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,940
道格
Doug.

196
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,110
-你没事吧  -我没事
- You okay? - Yeah. I'm all right.

197
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,620
怎么了  被锁在门外了吗
What, did you get locked out or something?

198
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,190
我之前想喝酒
I felt the need to drink.

199
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,470
我走到这儿  然后阻止了自己
I got this far and I stopped myself.

200
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,590
好吧
Okay.

201
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,770
我想让你看到
I wanted you to see it.

202
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,940
我可以控制自己
That I could control it.

203
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,770
你想回去吗
You wanna go back up?

204
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,110
好
Yeah.

205
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,070
我知道这看起来很过激
I know it looks crazy.

206
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,820
但我必须那么做
But I had to do it.

207
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,330
为什么
Why?

208
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:26,980
有个女孩  我受伤之前认识的
There was this girl... before the injury.

209
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,550
她离开了我  然后我开始酗酒
She left me. So I started drinking.

210
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,790
我试过忘记她
I tried to shut her out,

211
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,300
但我还是忍不住去查邮件和短信
but I just kept checking my e-mails, my text messages.

212
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,060
不能再那样下去了
It needed to stop.

213
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,410
她是谁
Who was she?

214
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,930
算了  没关系
You know what? That's okay.

215
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,920
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

216
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,390
重要的是  你今天被推到悬崖边
What matters is that you got pushed to the edge today

217
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,640
却没掉下去
and you didn't fall off.

218
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,290
你做了你该做的
You did what you had to do.

219
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,490
我不因此指责你
I don't judge you for it.

220
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,730
我也不觉得这过激
And I don't think it's crazy.

221
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,590
我们本可以在暖和点的地方见面
We could've met somewhere a little warmer.

222
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,730
沃尔玛想把这片拆光  建起超市
Walmart wanted to knock this down, build a store here.

223
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,070
-但是被社区阻止了  -我知道
- But the community put a stop to it. - I know.

224
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,520
因为他们不答应税收抵免
Because they wouldn't give a tax credit

225
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,560
除非最低工资标准提高
unless entry-level wages were higher.

226
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,850
一份糟透了的工作和没有工作  哪个更好
So which is better? A shitty job, or no job?

227
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,940
-我想我知道你的答案  -别那么肯定
- Well, I think I know your answer. - Don't be so sure.

228
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,910
杰姬  你一再反对
Jackie, you have repeatedly

229
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,550
我想让领导层推行的
opposed the minimum-wage and CEO salary bill

230
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,220
《最低工资和高管薪酬标准法案》
I asked the leadership to introduce.

231
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,410
我考虑了很多
I've put a lot of thought into it.

232
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,060
这个社区表明了它的立场
This community took a stand.

233
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,670
如果足够多的人站出来  国会只能行动
If enough of them do, Congress won't have a choice but to act.

234
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,760
我们是为了讨论立法而来的吗
Are we here to talk about legislation?

235
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,020
因为我们六个小时后就都要参加辩论了
Because we both have a debate in six hours.

236
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,040
我想支持你
I want to endorse you.

237
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,420
今晚我不攻击你  我们一起攻击安德伍德
I'll lay off you tonight. You and I attack Underwood.

238
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,860
三天后  我退出并支持你
In three days, I'll drop out and endorse.

239
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,740
第一次党团会议还没开过呢
We haven't even had the first caucus.

240
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,760
你们俩势均力敌
You two are neck-and-neck.

241
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,570
我在爱荷华有14%  新罕布什尔是12%
I have 14 points in Iowa, twelve in New Hampshire.

242
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,480
你得到我选民的支持  就能在两个州稳赢
You get my people, you have a clear win in both states.

243
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
我的支持是很宝贵的
My endorsement is valuable.

244
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,730
那安德伍德有多看重呢
How much does Underwood value it?

245
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,650
-非常看重  -他开出什么条件
- Highly. - What did he offer you?

246
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,160
我更想知道你能开出什么价码
I'm more interested in what you have to offer.

247
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,130
他保证给你内阁席位
Did he promise a cabinet position?

248
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,710
还不止吗
More than that?

249
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,360
他要带你一起竞选  是吗
He offered to put you on the ticket, didn't he?

250
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,520
我不指望你会带我竞选  希瑟
I wouldn't expect to be on your ticket, Heather.

251
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,610
你需要个带把儿的南方人
You need a Southerner with a penis.

252
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,260
考虑到我的战争经验  我想要国防部长
I was thinking Secretary of Defense, given my war record.

253
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,480
但其他的我也愿考虑
But I'd be open to other ideas.

254
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,430
有你支持当然好  杰姬  但我不能给你什么
I would love your support, Jackie, but I offer you nothing.

255
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,850
但是...这能轻巧取胜
But... this is an easy win.

256
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,930
我不会还没入主白宫
I'm not gonna start selling off cabinet positions

257
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,830
就出售内阁席位
before I've won the White House.

258
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,220
这种决定应该完全按资质做出
Those decisions will be based purely on merit.

259
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,700
我要是帮你拿下了提名
If I'm gonna lock up this nomination for you,

260
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,460
就理应得到报酬
I deserve to be compensated.

261
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,520
我想获胜  杰姬  只是方法与你不同
I plan on winning, Jackie. Just... not your way.

262
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,960
不管你支不支持我
And with or without your support.

263
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,600
那我可就跟安德伍德一条心了
Then I'm sticking with Underwood.

264
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,100
你做你该做的吧
You do what you have to do.

265
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,710
杰姬在吗
Is Jackie in here?

266
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,030
鲍勃
Hi, Bob.

267
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,160
不好意思我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

268
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,720
-手术进行得如何  -糟透了
- How did your surgery go? - Terrible.

269
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,790
病人差点没挺过去
The patient almost didn't make it.

270
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,740
但是他还活着
But he's alive?

271
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,480
是她  还活着  情况稳定了
She. And yeah. Stable condition.

272
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,310
你能来对我意义重大
It means so much to me that you came.

273
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,080
妆化好了
All done.

274
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,250
-还满意吗  -很不错  谢谢
- Do you like? - It's good. Thank you.

275
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,810
-那什么怎么样了  -谢谢
- So, how'd it go with--? - Thanks.

276
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,460
她开出什么条件
What'd she offer?

277
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,330
什么都没有
Nothing.

278
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,390
-完全没有吗  -是啊  我也没想到
- Nothing at all? - I know, I was surprised, too.

279
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,420
太不明智了  她本可锁定胜局
It's foolish. She could lock this up.

280
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,340
但不得不承认  我几乎心生敬意
I have to say, I almost... respect it.

281
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,530
不管怎样  你是对的
Anyway, you were right.

282
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,490
忠于你了解的那个魔鬼
Stick with the devil you know.

283
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,160
孩子们今晚会看辩论吗
Are the kids watching tonight?

284
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,430
会的  他们把朋友都叫到家里了
Yeah. They've got all their friends over at the house.

285
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,360
那个  孩子...
Listen, the ki--

286
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,520
怎么了
What?

287
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,000
没什么  我看起来怎么样
Nothing. How do I look?

288
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,930
我想立马把你扔到床上
I'd throw you on that bed right now

289
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,450
可惜会弄乱你的头发
if it wouldn't mess up your hair.

290
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,570
看我准备吧
Watch me prep.

291
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,720
辩论结束之后你想怎么弄乱我头发都随你
You can mess up my hair all you want after the debate.

292
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,820
-她来了  -她来了
- She's here. - There she is.

293
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,930
安静  安静  她来了
Quiet, guys. Quiet, guys. Here she comes.

294
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,750
安静
Quiet, quiet!

295
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,970
谢谢  感谢你们  大家好
Thank you. Thank you. Hello, everyone!

296
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,130
非常感谢大家
Thank all of you so very much

297
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,250
为我们能拿下新罕布什尔这么努力
for working so hard to make sure we take New Hampshire.

298
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,120
正是这样的办事处能让我们赢得初选
It is field offices like this that win primaries,

299
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,600
总统想让大家知道
and the president wants you to know

300
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,210
你们的奉献对我们来说多么重要
how much your dedication means to us.

301
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,210
真的感谢大家  谢谢
Thank you so much. Thank you.

302
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,510
谁想看辩论
Now, who's ready to watch a debate?

303
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,500
在苏城  人们齐聚一堂
There is a large crowd here in Sioux City tonight.

304
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,830
我想说潜在选民  但当然在爱荷华
I would say potential voters, but of course, here in Iowa,

305
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,630
市民们是通过党团会议而非投票的方式初选
citizens caucus instead of vote,

306
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,180
而今天到场的许多人
and many of the people here in this room

307
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,350
都会参加1月15日的党团会议
will be doing just that on January 15th.

308
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,010
一份CNN民意调查显示
A CNN ORC poll has it

309
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,660
目前两名领跑者的支持率不相上下
as a tight race between the two front-runners.

310
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,220
希瑟·邓巴的支持率为32%
Heather Dunbar at 32 percent.

311
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,590
弗兰克·安德伍德总统的支持率为30%
President Frank Underwood at 30 percent.

312
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,590
杰姬·夏普议员女士以14%排在第三位
Congresswoman Jackie Sharp trails in third at 14 percent.

313
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,730
还有22%尚未决定
Twenty-two percent remain undecided.

314
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,060
你可以换台
You can switch it.

315
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,340
真的吗
Really?

316
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,110
除非你想看
Unless you want to watch.

317
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,280
不  我以为你想看
No, I thought you would.

318
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,410
这是你在这里的最后一晚
It's your last night here.

319
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,190
我想和我哥哥一起度过
I want to spend it with my brother,

320
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,910
而不是弗兰克·安德伍德
not Frank Underwood.

321
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,730
那你想看什么
What do you want to watch instead?

322
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,150
随便  你想看的就行
Anything. Whatever you want.

323
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,050
...保证全民就业
...promising universal employment,

324
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,760
而在巴以关系上...
and on Israeli Palestinian relations...

325
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,710
天  你看过《传染病》吗
Oh, shit. Have you ever seen Contagion?

326
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,040
没有
No.

327
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,580
如果你有洁癖
If you're a clean freak,

328
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,410
这片子绝对能让你更加洁癖
this'll definitely make you a germ freak.

329
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,490
-我爱死这部电影了  -那就看吧
- I love this movie. - Go for it.

330
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,550
欢迎收看CNN举办的
Welcome to the first

331
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,940
第一场民主党提名辩论会
Democratic nomination debate hosted by CNN.

332
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,870
今晚的候选人为  弗兰克·安德伍德
Our candidates tonight: Frank Underwood,

333
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,890
杰姬·夏普和希瑟·邓巴
Jackie Sharp, and Heather Dunbar.

334
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,050
我是约翰·金  今晚你们的调解人
I'm John King and I'll be your moderator tonight.

335
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,390
辩论分为两个部分
Our debate will be divided in two parts,

336
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,950
第一部分聚焦外交政策
the first part focusing on foreign policy,

337
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,540
第二部分则着重于国内政策
part two focusing on the domestic agenda.

338
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,370
辩论形式如下
And our format will be as follows:

339
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,570
我会向每位候选人提一个问题
I will ask one candidate a question.

340
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,610
候选人有一分钟时间来回答
That candidate will have one minute to answer.

341
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,890
随后  所有候选人可以进行五分钟的
After that, all of our candidates can engage in an open conversation

342
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,650
自由讨论
lasting for five minutes.

343
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,350
首先请各位候选人进行开场陈述
We begin, though, with opening statements.

344
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,030
经抽签决定
And by lottery, it was decided

345
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,610
先从安德伍德总统开始
that President Underwood goes first.

346
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,740
-总统先生  -谢谢  晚上好  约翰
- Mr. President. - Thank you. And good evening, John,

347
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,220
另外两位候选人晚上好
good evening to my fellow candidates,

348
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,730
苏城的好市民们晚上好
and to the good people of Sioux City.

349
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,410
这次提名归根结底就是一个词  愿景
This nomination comes down to one word: vision.

350
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,960
我相信我已经通过《美国就业法案》向全国人民
I believe that I have shown a clear vision to this country

351
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,170
展现了一个清晰的愿景
with America Works,

352
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,270
它是近一个世纪以来最全面的就业计划
the most comprehensive jobs program in nearly a century.

353
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,950
我们已经证明该法案在华盛顿取得了成功
We showed it could work in Washington DC.

354
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,010
现在我们需要将我们的成功推广到全国
We need now to take what we did there and spread it nationwide,

355
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,980
这样美国梦就能真正美梦成真
so that the American dream can become the American reality.

356
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,820
但是光有愿景还不够
But that vision isn't enough on its own.

357
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,500
你们需要一个有经验的人来实现这份愿景
You need someone with experience to make it happen.

358
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,590
考虑到我在国会和白宫的经历
And between my time in Congress and now at the White House,

359
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,390
我的经验比两位对手加起来还要丰富
I have more experience than both of my opponents combined.

360
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,180
当你考虑雇佣一个人的时候
And, uh, when you hire someone for a job,

361
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,440
你是会选择有三十年工作经验的人
are you gonna hire someone with 30 years' experience,

362
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,130
还是不到十年工作经验的人
or someone with less than ten

363
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,700
还是完全没有经验的人
or someone with no experience at all?

364
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,260
在我南方老家那边
Where I come from down south,

365
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,110
我们管这种情况叫做显而易见
we call that as clear as a glass of moonshine.

366
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,170
接下来有请前副检察长邓巴女士
Former Solicitor General Dunbar is next.

367
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,340
-致开场陈述  -谢谢  约翰
- Your opening statement, please. - Thank you, John.

368
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,830
也感谢爱荷华人民
And thank you Iowa.

369
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,490
我同意总统刚才所说的
Well, I agree with the President.

370
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,060
愿景和经验正是美国人民需要的
Vision and experience are exactly what America needs.

371
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,720
不幸的是
Unfortunately,

372
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,080
他拥有的是错误的愿景和糟糕的经验
he has the wrong vision and horrendous experience.

373
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,540
你可以说《美国就业法案》有远见  但实际上
You can call America Works visionary, but in truth,

374
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,250
它只是一个存在了数十年的
it is just an ultra-conservative agenda

375
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,960
极其保守的议程
that's been around for decades.

376
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,550
瓦解安全保障  让人们自生自灭
Dismantle the safety net and hang people out to dry.

377
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,470
至于总统先生的经验
As for the President's experience,

378
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,900
他在领导层在任期间
he was in the leadership during

379
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,040
正值国会历史上最低效的时期之一
one of the most ineffective decades in Congressional history.

380
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,200
作为总统  他经手的每一件事都失败了
As president, he has failed at everything he's done.

381
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,420
《美国就业法案》在包括我在内的
America Works was illegal in the minds

382
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,620
许多法律专业人士看来都是违法的
of many legal experts, myself included.

383
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,640
他的约旦河谷计划彻底失败
His Jordan Valley plan was a disaster.

384
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,680
如果你把这些称为经验
If that's what you call experience,

385
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,570
那你不仅是在美化履历  而是伪造履历了
you're not just padding the résumé, you are fabricating it.

386
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,680
安德伍德总统并不是在向我们展示愿景
President Underwood isn't presenting us with a vision,

387
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,460
而是在说服自己相信自己的妄想
he is convincing himself of his own delusion.

388
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,670
我的愿景则是遏制大企业的贪婪
Now, my vision is to tackle corporate greed,

389
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,950
为最需要的人们提高薪酬
raise pay for those who need it most,

390
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,760
通过刺激经济增长制造就业
and create jobs by growing the economy,

391
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,180
而不是抢劫人民的退休金和医保
not robbing people of their retirement and health care.

392
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,230
我的经验是二十年捍卫宪法的经历
My experience is 20 years defending the Constitution.

393
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,910
所以你们可以肯定  当我宣誓就职时
You know when I take my presidential oath,

394
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,820
我会遵守誓言的每一个字
I will mean every word of it.

395
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,200
邓巴女士  谢谢  夏普众议员女士
Ms. Dunbar, thank you. Congresswoman Sharp,

396
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,050
-你的开场陈述  -谢谢
- your opening statement, please. - Thank you.

397
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,720
很多人都知道我曾是一名美国军人
As many of you know, I am a US Army veteran.

398
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,330
我曾亲睹我的战友们
Now, I've seen firsthand the great sacrifices

399
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,580
为守卫这个国家做出的伟大牺牲
my fellow servicemen and women have made defending this country.

400
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,950
但我怎能让他们去保卫这个
But how can we ask them to protect a system

401
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,220
没在保护我们的系统
that isn't protecting us?

402
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,610
比如说女性
Take women, for example.

403
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,480
这儿有两名女性参与了总统竞选
There are two women at this debate running for president.

404
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,400
十分了不起  可是在普通工作场合呢
That's extraordinary. But out in the general workforce?

405
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,920
男性赚一美元而女性只能赚77美分
Women earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men.

406
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,550
少数裔女性甚至只有67美分
Even worse is minority women earning 67 cents on the dollar.

407
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,110
邓巴女士可以高谈阔论缩小贫富差距
Now, Ms. Dunbar can talk about balancing the scales,

408
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,050
但她继承了亿万家产
but she inherited a multi-billion-dollar fortune

409
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,150
从未需要去努力赚一分钱
and never had to earn any cents on the dollar.

410
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,840
我不认同安德伍德总统
Now, I don't agree with everything

411
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,800
所做或是提议的所有事
that President Underwood has done or proposes,

412
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,330
但至少他知道为生活辛苦打拼的滋味
but at least he knows what it means to work for a living.

413
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,870
我还能带给你们更多
I can give you even better than that.

414
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,880
我知道为生活斗争的滋味
I know what it means to fight for a living.

415
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,560
我将在国内努力为公平而战
And I will fight for fairness here at home

416
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,560
正如我当初在海外与敌人拼死斗争
just as fiercely as I fought our enemies overseas.

417
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,610
谢谢
Thank you.

418
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,890
谢谢  议员女士
Thank you, Congresswoman.

419
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,860
我们开始第一部分  对外政策
Let's move to part one: foreign policy.

420
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,990
第一个问题是给您的  总统先生
And the first question is for you, Mr. President.

421
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,440
鉴于近期约旦河谷多变的形势
Given the recent volatile events in the Jordan Valley,

422
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,100
您仍然认为集结
do you still believe it was correct

423
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
联合国多国军队进行干预  是正确的决定吗
to assemble the United Nations coalition and to intervene,

424
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,610
或者我们该承认此次行动是错误的
or is it time now to call that intervention a mistake?

425
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,230
我会回答这个问题的  约翰
Well, I will answer that question, John,

426
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,290
但我首先需要反驳
but I'd like to address first

427
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,670
邓巴女士刚刚说的一些话
something Ms. Dunbar said a few moments ago.

428
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,480
《美国就业法案》不是陈旧保守的议程
America Works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.

429
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,450
你能说出一个共和党人
You name me one Republican

430
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,650
曾建议我们拿联邦基金
who has suggested using federal funds

431
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,250
为每一个想要工作的美国人
to guarantee jobs for every American

432
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,960
提供工作  我就把帽子吃了
who wants one and I will eat my hat.

433
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,490
这不是在瓦解政府  这是在...
This isn't about dismantling government. It is about--

434
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,350
我们不是该讨论对外政策吗
Aren't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?

435
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,220
我会谈到的  但首先
Yeah, I will. But first,

436
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,140
-我想纠正一下...  -因为谈论
- I'd like to correct... - because it's easier to talk about

437
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,100
《美国就业法案》
America Works

438
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,530
比维护你站不住脚的联合国行动更容易
than to defend your indefensible UN mission.

439
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,630
至少我有可维护的过去  邓巴女士
At least I have a record to defend, Ms. Dunbar.

440
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,490
说到过去  总统先生
Speaking of your record, Mr. President,

441
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,940
您曾公开表明不会竞选总统
you went on record saying you wouldn't run for president.

442
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,500
-可却还是参选了  -约翰  看起来
- And yet here you are. - John, it seems that

443
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,750
你精心制定的规则已经失效了
your very thoughtful rules have gone out the window.

444
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,810
您对规则毫不尊重  总统先生
You have no respect for rules, Mr. President.

445
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,120
比如联邦应急管理署
Take FEMA, for example.

446
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,750
你现在要说联邦应急管理署
Oh, you want to talk about FEMA now

447
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,920
而非对外政策了吗
instead of foreign policy.

448
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,120
我只是顺着您的话往下接
I am just following your lead, sir.

449
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,110
看我们在您的领导下
See what a mess we get into

450
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,360
陷入怎样的混乱啊
when we follow your brand of leadership?

451
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,240
我必须承认  邓巴女士
Well, I must admit that Ms. Dunbar

452
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,680
确实在辞令华丽的辩论方面
does have many years of experience

453
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,640
有多年经验
making rhetorical arguments in court.

454
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,310
今天看到的就是最好的证明
You've just seen proof of that today.

455
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,580
可是服务美国人民并非靠口头上的功夫
But serving the American people is not about what you say,

456
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,000
而在于行动
it's about what you do.

457
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,100
我想问  你做了什么
And I would ask: what have you ever done?

458
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,890
我同意  邓巴女士经验的缺乏令人担心
I have to agree that Ms. Dunbar's lack of experience is a concern.

459
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,130
总统居然提起经验的重要性
I find it ironic that the president talks about

460
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,640
讽刺的是
the importance of experience,

461
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,770
他任命了毫无任何资质的妻子
given the fact that he appointed his wife UN ambassador

462
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,020
为联合国大使
despite her utter lack of credentials.

463
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,910
这是性别歧视
That's a sexist comment.

464
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,780
你说什么
Excuse me?

465
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,710
如果是一名女性总统任命自己的丈夫
You wouldn't be making that argument

466
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,470
你肯定不会这么说
if a female president had appointed her husband.

467
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,270
一个像克莱尔·安德伍德那样缺乏
A husband with the same lack of international affairs experience

468
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,700
外交经验的丈夫吗  我还是会的
as Claire Underwood? Yes, I would.

469
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,800
事实上  这让我质疑你对于女性的支持  
In fact, it makes me question your advocacy for women in general.

470
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,330
真荒谬
Well, that's ridiculous.

471
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,910
你在推动性别平等方面做过什么
What have you done to further gender equality?

472
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,860
你在缩小贫富差距方面做过什么
What have you done to balance the scales?

473
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,440
那是你的口号
That's your slogan, and yet

474
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,840
可你却无视了一半的人口
you've left half of the population out of the mix.

475
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
事实不是这样的
But that is simply not true.

476
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,570
你能说出一件事吗
Can, can you name one specific thing?

477
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,280
当然  我是史上少有的
Yes, I can. Being a woman, who has served as Solicitor General,

478
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,380
曾担任过副检察长的女性
one of the few in the history of the court.

479
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,040
这符合你个人的利益
Well, that advanced your interests,

480
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,190
可那对于1.5亿女性有什么用呢
but what did that do for 150 million women out there?

481
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,240
身为女性能够担任这样的职位
The very fact that a woman can hold that position--

482
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,760
-那么你是一种象征  -某种程度上我是
- So you are a symbol. - In a way, yes, I suppose I am.

483
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,330
包括你在内的很多女性
Me and many other women, including yourself--

484
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,990
可这样能够让我们
Okay, but how does that get us

485
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,410
从挣77美分变成一美元吗
from 77 cents on the dollar to 100?

486
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,920
真实的钱  不是象征意义的
Real cents. Not symbolic cents.

487
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,580
你现在只是在模仿总统的说辞
Well, now you're just aping the president's rhetoric.

488
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,760
又是性别歧视
Another sexist comment.

489
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,090
-你怎么可以这么扭曲我的话  -我只代表自己
- How could you possibly misconstrue my words? - I speak for myself.

490
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,530
我不是在模仿总统  或者任何男人
I am not aping the president or any other man.

491
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,350
抱歉  我不会回应这种...
I'm sorry, I won't engage with this--

492
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,440
战场上  战事激烈的时候
You know, when things get tough on the battlefield,

493
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,920
我们可不会说
we never say,

494
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,810
"抱歉  我不会回应[开火]"
"Sorry, I won't engage."

495
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,220
我们做出回应  邓巴女士
We engage, Ms. Dunbar.

496
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,600
而你得面对这个事实
And you need to confront the fact

497
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,320
那就是你并未把女性的利益放在心上
that you do not have women's best interests at heart.

498
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,270
约翰  这样没法收场了
John, this is getting out of hand.

499
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,270
好吧  开始下一个问题
All right, then let's move on to the next question.

500
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,210
现在的辩论主题是外交政策
We are in the foreign policy portion of this debate.

501
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,190
邓巴女士  请允许我问你这个问题
Ms. Dunbar, let me bring this question to you.

502
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,330
你不赞成总统的做法
You're critical of the president.

503
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,690
你说他在约旦河谷的所作所为完全站不住脚
You say it's indefensible, what he has done in the Jordan Valley.

504
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,840
-对  -如果换做是你  你具体会怎么做呢
- That's right. - But specifically, what would you do differently?

505
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,900
约翰  我很高兴你问了这个问题
Well, John, I'm glad you asked that.

506
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,490
在我看来  把军队派往
Sending troops into the

507
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,660
-约旦河谷算不上外交  -我得回酒店了
- Jordan Valley isn't what I call diplomacy. - I need to go back to the hotel.

508
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,070
各位  安德伍德夫人得走了
Everybody, Mrs. Underwood needs to leave us now.

509
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,320
真希望我可以留下来
I really wish I could stay,

510
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,850
但我明天的行程很满
but I have a very full day tomorrow.

511
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,480
我得回去休息了  不过我想再次感谢所有人
I should rest up. But again, I want to thank you all

512
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,750
感谢你们的招待还有你们的辛勤工作
for your hospitality and all of your hard work.

513
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,020
非常感谢各位
Thank you so much.

514
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,860
大家晚安
Good night, everyone.

515
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,510
他的滴入式外交政策只不过是又一个妄想
His trickle-down diplomacy is another example of delusion.

516
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,140
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood.

517
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,150
你该回去  跟志愿者待在一起
Oh, you should go back inside with the volunteers

518
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,280
体验竞选的每个方面
and have the full campaign experience.

519
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,010
我来新罕布什尔不是为了这个
I didn't come to New Hampshire for that.

520
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,170
我是来找你谈话的
I came to speak with you.

521
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,670
也许明天吧  我现在不太清醒
Tomorrow, maybe. My brain is a bit fried.

522
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,980
是因为夏普的话吗
Is it what Sharp said?

523
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,640
你是为这个看不下去了吗
Why you don't want to watch anymore?

524
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,600
-那个性别歧视的发言  -我不关心那个
- The sexist comment? - Oh, I honestly don't care.

525
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,020
那不过是一场表演
It's all spectacle.

526
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,760
看谁能拉到更多支持率  不是吗
Who can get the most points, right?

527
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,050
晚安
Good night.

528
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,040
现在进行辩论的第二部分  国内政策
Now for part two of our debate: the domestic agenda.

529
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,260
第一个问题是给你的  议员女士
And the first question goes to you, Congresswoman.

530
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,330
总统提到了《美国就业法案》
The President speaks of America Works.

531
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,210
邓巴女士想要提高最低工资
Ms. Dunbar wants to raise minimum wage.

532
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,990
她提到了控制高管薪酬
Talks about regulating executive pay.

533
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,540
但很多人还不清楚
But a lot of people aren't quite clear

534
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,090
你主张的经济政策
about your economic policy.

535
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,080
具体来说  我特别强调"具体"
What specifically, I underscore "Specifically,"

536
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,100
你若当选总统会怎么做
would you do if elected president?

537
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,970
我要做的有很多  这点我们之前已经谈过
Well, I plan to do a lot. And we talked about this earlier.

538
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,810
首先  最重要的是
First and foremost,

539
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,730
我想推动男女平等
I want to press for gender equality

540
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,530
消除薪资差距
and close the salary gap.

541
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,660
如果一半的就业人员
If half of the working population

542
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,610
能拿到更多的工资
has more money in their pockets,

543
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,680
这会刺激消费  促进经济增长
that will catalyze spending, which will grow the economy,

544
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,180
最终创造更多就业机会
which will, in turn, create more jobs.

545
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,270
总统先生  你怎么看
Mr. President, what do you think of that?

546
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,360
我同意这种想法  我认为男女平等非常重要
Oh, I agree. I think that gender equality is very important.

547
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,230
在我主张的《美就法》中
And under my AmWorks program,

548
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,470
会有一项条款  《美就法》下所有的就业岗位
there will be a provision that all AmWorks jobs,

549
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,090
都不能出现男女薪资不平等的情况
there can be no discrepancy in pay between men and women.

550
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,910
《美就法》  这只是政府提供的工作
AmWorks jobs, so that's the government.

551
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,010
那其它的私人企业呢
What about the rest of the private sector?

552
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,100
我认为得先有榜样
Well, I think we have to start by leading by example,

553
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,160
再着手立法...
then we introduce legislation...

554
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,140
榜样
Leading by example?

555
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,510
{\an8}如果《美国就业法案》就是你所谓的榜样
If America Works is how you lead by example...

556
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,250
抱歉  请让我说完  邓巴女士
I'm sorry, please let me finish my point, Mr. Dunbar.

557
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,650
{\an8}如果这就是你所谓的榜样
If that is how you lead by example,

558
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,880
那我们是否要认为  每个人都要非法地
then are we to assume that everyone should illegally

559
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,400
占用他们不该占用的资金
raid funds that they have no right to use?

560
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,500
每个人都要去抢银行吗
Everyone should start robbing banks?

561
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,430
去打劫酒水店吗
Holding up liquor stores?

562
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,180
邓巴女士  无意冒犯
Now, Ms. Dunbar, with all due respect,

563
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,980
你可以尽情地批判我的计划
you can criticize my programs as much as you want,

564
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,640
但要指控我违法...
but to accuse me of illegal activity--

565
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,540
有一件事你无法否认  那就是在宪法上
One thing you can't deny is that I am much more of an authority

566
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,640
我懂的比你多得多  总统先生
on the Constitution than you are, Mr. President.

567
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,870
邓巴女士  我们三个人
Ms. Dunbar, all three of us on this stage

568
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,190
都曾进行过宣誓就职
have taken oaths of office.

569
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,900
我认为我们都捍卫了宪法
I would have to say that we have all defended the Constitution.

570
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,160
宪法不是你一个人的
You don't have some special claim on the Constitution.

571
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,610
宪法属于在座的所有人
The Constitution belongs to everyone in this room

572
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,870
它属于美国的每一位公民
and every citizen in the United States.

573
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,080
但我想问夏普女士
But I would ask Ms. Sharp,

574
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,520
你投票同意废除《美国就业法案》
you voted in favor of dismantling America Works.

575
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,870
这么做是因为你认为该法案
Was that because you thought it was in fact,

576
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,380
如邓巴女士所言  是非法的吗
as Ms. Dunbar says, illegal?

577
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,600
我当时投票废除法案  是因为我想确保
I voted for dismantlement because I wanted to make sure

578
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,180
我们做好了飓风的应对工作
we were prepared for the hurricane,

579
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,560
而不是由于我认为
not because I thought your

580
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,730
你对《斯塔福法案》的解读是非法的
reading of the Stafford Act was illegal per se.

581
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,410
真的吗  你认为总统有权做那种事吗
Honestly, you think the president had a right to do what he did?

582
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,420
这是拨款问题  不是法律问题
It's an appropriations issue, not a legal one.

583
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,710
那他的人格呢
What about his character?

584
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,910
他相当于直接走进联邦应急管理署对大家说
He basically walked into FEMA and said,

585
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,730
"举起手来  告诉我保险库在哪里"
"Stick 'em up and show me where the vault is."

586
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,440
我现在又成抢劫犯了  六抢·安德伍德
So now I'm a bank robber. Six Gun Underwood,

587
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,220
南卡罗莱纳就这么叫我
what they call me in South Carolina.

588
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,940
抱歉  但我不觉得这有什么好笑的
I'm sorry, but I do not find this funny.

589
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,920
要我说你就是伪君子
I say you are a hypocrite.

590
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,810
你声称在乎那些一千万失业人口
You claim to care about the ten million people out of work,

591
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,060
但你却盗用了他们的赈灾基金
but you will steal their Disaster Relief Fund...

592
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,800
{\an8}这是拨款问题  邓巴女士
This is an appropriations issue, Miss Dunbar.

593
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,790
-社会保险和医疗福利  -我来说说什么虚伪
- Social Security and health care. - I'd like to talk about hypocrisy.

594
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,520
{\an8}我们在华盛顿特区创造了五万个工作岗位
We put 50,000 people to work in Washington DC.

595
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,890
希瑟·邓巴想要缩小贫富差距
Heather Dunbar wants to balance the scales

596
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,570
修复失衡的系统
to fix a broken system.

597
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:52,340
与此同时她却送自己的孩子上私立学校
And yet she sends her own kids to private school.

598
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,820
用的并非她工作所得收入  而是继承的遗产
With money she never earned, but which she inherited.

599
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,690
出身显赫  却高谈贫困问题
Now, it is easy to talk about the problems of the poor

600
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,390
是站着说话不腰疼
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

601
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,050
我是否家境富裕  确实如此
Am I well-off? Absolutely.

602
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,530
罗斯福推行新政时也是如此
So was FDR when he developed the New Deal.

603
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,810
什么时候人的同情心由收入决定了
Since when does one's income determine one's amount of empathy?

604
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,490
你会送你的孩子上公立学校吗
Would you send your kids to public school?

605
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,140
别再提及我们的孩子了
Let's keep our children out of this.

606
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,770
你希望你的孩子赢在起跑线上
You want your kids to have a head start,

607
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,400
胜过那些上公立学校的孩子
to have an advantage over the kids in public schools.

608
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,700
许多收入水平各不相同的美国人
Lots of Americans, of all ranges of income,

609
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,890
都选择送他们的孩子上私立或教区学校
choose to send their children to private or parochial schools.

610
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,560
但你希望你的孩子比其他孩子
But isn't it true that you want your children

611
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,860
更胜一筹  不是吗
to have a leg up on everyone else?

612
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,730
这是平衡差距吗  还是虚伪
Is that balancing the scales? Or is that hypocrisy?

613
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,960
或许  你是根本不想亲自养育他们
Or maybe it's that you didn't want to raise them yourself

614
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,680
才送他们去上寄宿学校
so you sent them to boarding school.

615
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,770
看来你真的很想当总统
You must really want to be president.

616
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,080
我永远都不会
I would never in a million years

617
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,170
在辩论中提到你的孩子
bring up your children in a debate.

618
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,060
你想怎样养育他们是你的私事
The way you choose to raise them is your business.

619
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,900
我想给我的孩子最好的一切吗  当然
Do I want the best for my kids? Yes, I do.

620
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,390
我想你也一样
I imagine you're the same way.

621
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,530
希望是如此
I hope you are.

622
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,430
你们两位肯定都是很棒的母亲
Well, I'm sure you're both excellent mothers.

623
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,780
但也许我们该回到
But perhaps we should get back to

624
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,930
-眼前的问题上  -夏普议员女士
- some of the issues at hand. - Congresswoman Sharp

625
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,170
之前提到性别歧视问题
raised the issue of sexism earlier.

626
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,430
这是很重要的问题  需要进行讨论
Now, it is an important point, and we need to address it.

627
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,200
性别歧视不可取  议员女士说得没错
Sexism is wrong. The Congresswoman is correct

628
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,060
不论何种形式的性别歧视都应被视为违法
in saying that all aspects of it should be illegal.

629
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,600
然后她指责我批评克莱尔·安德伍德
And then, she accused me of being sexist

630
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,260
是性别歧视
for criticizing Claire Underwood.

631
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,140
但这个逻辑放到你身上不也成立吗  夏普女士
But wouldn't that same logic hold true for you, Ms. Sharp?

632
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,780
如果我是男人你还会紧咬我的孩子不放吗
Would you have come after my kids if I were a man?

633
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,950
你不就是想把我抹黑成一个糟糕的母亲
Aren't you trying to paint the picture that I'm a bad mother,

634
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,690
把自己的孩子送去个偏远的地方
shipping my kids off to some far-flung place?

635
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,720
因为你知道如果你能把我抹黑成一个坏母亲
Because you know if you can make me seem like a bad mother,

636
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,610
不可能还会有人支持我
then how could anyone possibly support me?

637
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,170
这不是正面攻击  这只让人恶心
That's not hardball, that is just disgusting.

638
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,180
我必须说我认为邓巴女士说得有道理
Well, I have to say I do think Ms. Dunbar has a point.

639
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,700
说到虚伪
I mean, speaking of hypocrisy,

640
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,790
你不是也送自己的孩子上私立学校吗
don't you send your own kids to private school,

641
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,910
议员女士
Congresswoman?

642
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,170
那不是我的论点  我...
Well, that wasn't my point. I--

643
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,450
你的论点是什么
What was your point?

644
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,620
我
Well, I was, um...

645
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,350
我的论点...
My... My point....

646
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,650
约翰  我想在这个议题上我该说的都说完了
John, I think I've said all I need to say on this subject.

647
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,020
那好吧  议员女士
All right, fair enough, Congresswoman.

648
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,100
下个问题是问你的  邓巴女士
Next question goes to you, Ms. Dunbar.

649
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,660
好了  观众们  第一轮民调结果出来了
Okay, guys, first poll is coming in.

650
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,600
大多数都支持弗兰克·安德伍德
Most of them give Frank Underwood the win.

651
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,840
但优势并不明显
Not by a lot.

652
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,690
但他所做的能打败邓巴  在竞选中领跑吗
But did he do enough to overtake Dunbar, become the front-runner?

653
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,120
乔治  我认为关键并不在于安德伍德做了什么
George, I don't think it's so much what Underwood did,

654
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,060
而是他没做什么
but what he didn't do.

655
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,580
他保持了总统的气度
He remained presidential.

656
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,660
当他被攻击时  他保持了风度
And when the attacks came his way, he held the high ground.

657
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,200
邓巴和夏普都出击凌厉
Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out swinging,

658
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,200
我认为这对她们都不利
and I think it hurt them both.

659
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,730
没错  但夏普必须有所作为
Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.

660
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,370
她落后其他两人20%
She's 20 points behind the other two.

661
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,060
但性别歧视的论调  还攻击邓巴的孩子
But the sexism thing? And going after Dunbar's kids?

662
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,200
感觉很孤注一掷
It seemed quite desperate.

663
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,920
她确实对邓巴造成了一些伤害
She did do some damage to Dunbar.

664
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,270
这我不敢肯定  邓巴的情况本可能糟
I don't know about that. Dunbar could've fared far worse.

665
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,510
她承受住了打击  也主动出击
She took it on the chin, held her own,

666
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,310
在我看来这是平局
and in my opinion, it was a tie.

667
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,780
但最重要的是这场辩论会带来什么改变吗
But bottom line, does this debate change anything?

668
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,770
这会影响党团会议结果吗
Does it affect the caucus,

669
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,240
这会影响新罕布什尔的初选吗
Does it affect the primary in New Hampshire?

670
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,780
现在离投票还有一个月
We're still over a month out.

671
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,870
这段时间里还有很多变数
And so a lot could change in this process,

672
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,200
但我认为现在的形势对安德伍德有利
but I do think the momentum could shift in Underwood's favor.

673
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,590
让我们别忘记  值得注意的是  现任总统
Let's not forget that it's remarkable that a sitting president

674
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,550
原本并非竞选中的领跑者
isn't considered the front-runner to begin with.

675
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,650
提得很好
That's an excellent point.

676
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,680
从未有过现任总统  要从这么落后的位置往上拼
No incumbent has ever had to fight back from this far...

677
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,800
-喂  -他说她不接电话  先生
- Yes? - He said she's not picking up, sir.

678
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,870
需要我叫他去敲她门吗
Would you like me to have him knock on her door?

679
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,420
不用了  谢谢
No, that's all right. Thank you.

680
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,700
你什么话都没说
You haven't said a word.

681
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,600
你准备辩论几天了
Well, you've been prepping for days.

682
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,930
我觉得你会想静一静
I thought you might want a break from talking.

683
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,230
你对我很失望
You're disappointed in me.

684
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,500
因为孩子被提到了
That the kids got mentioned.

685
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,380
他们还小  没事的
They're teenagers. They'll be fine.

686
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,460
估计还很激动自己被提到了
Probably thrilled... that they got mentioned at all.

687
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,360
要说我对谁失望
If I'm disappointed in anyone,

688
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,820
也是对他把你往火坑里推失望
it's him, for throwing you under the bus.

689
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,880
我今晚跟你一块飞回去
I gotta fly back with you tonight.

690
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,950
你明天不是还有活动吗
Don't you have events tomorrow?

691
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,630
这事更重要
This is more important.

692
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,010
什么事
What is?

693
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,570
感谢大家前来
Thank you all for coming in.

694
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,150
请从这边出口出去
If you want to head out this door right here.

695
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,600
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

696
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,060
好了  我就不打扰你了
All right, I'll give you some privacy.

697
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,380
大概只需15分钟
This should only take 15 minutes.

698
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,090
-有需要就叫我们  -谢谢你
- So just holler out if you need anything. - Thank you.

699
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,430
拿把椅子来  我们可以边等边聊
Pull up a chair. We can talk while this finishes up.

700
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,290
我也应该献个血
I should be doing this, too.

701
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,710
这里应该够再放把躺椅
I'm sure we could get another lawn chair in here.

702
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,090
我不能献血  以前有毒瘾
I can't. I was a junkie once upon a time.

703
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,750
你管这叫什么颜色  猩红色不贴切
What would you call this color? Scarlet isn't right.

704
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,280
也不是深红或褐红
It's not crimson or maroon.

705
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,680
-洋红色  -洋红色吗
- Carmine. - Carmine?

706
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,500
果然作家就是不一样
You must be a writer.

707
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,890
不  我知道  但她总跟别人说
No, I know that. But you know she always tells everyone

708
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,530
她都是自己烤的  但我知道肯定不是
she bakes them herself and I know she doesn't.

709
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,290
这是本地的
That's local.

710
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,400
谢谢你的支持  等我到了之后见
Thank you for your support. I'll see you when I get there.

711
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,800
为什么我们不能在电话里谈
Is there some reason we couldn't do this by phone?

712
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,530
这需要当面谈清楚
This needed to be in person.

713
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,310
是  但你把你的活动都取消了
Yes, but you canceled all your events.

714
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,900
我想跟你谈谈辩论的事
I want to talk about the debate.

715
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,190
虽然不是我们期望中的大获全胜
You know, it wasn't the home run we hoped for,

716
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,440
但你干得不错  杰姬
but you did great, Jackie.

717
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,350
她一半时间都在防守辩护
She spent half the debate on the defensive.

718
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,810
我让自己难堪了
I humiliated myself.

719
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,490
你只是受了点挫败
You got a little beat up, that's all.

720
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,480
而你下了最重的一拳
And you threw the biggest punch.

721
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,090
你是说你孩子的事吗
Oh, you mean the thing about your kids?

722
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,270
那不是我们说好的
That wasn't what we discussed.

723
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,760
我必须对你下重手  这样她就不能了
I had to hit you hard so she wouldn't.

724
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,380
再说  我们得打消
And besides, we had to dispel any suspicion

725
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,840
我俩串通的猜疑
that you and I might be in concert.

726
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,090
我不喜欢我们现在的这种关系
I'm not comfortable with the dynamic we've established.

727
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,980
什么关系
What dynamic is that?

728
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,280
你拴着我得那条绳索
The leash you have me on.

729
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,810
我得对你言听计从
How I'm supposed to roll over and do any trick you want.

730
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,050
你是不把我当回事
You're taking me for granted.

731
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,390
不然呢  我该怎么着
What, am I supposed to be, uh...

732
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,560
感激你那乏善可陈的热情
appreciative of your lackluster enthusiasm?

733
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:06,160
你"算是"跟我一队是我天大的幸运吗
How fortunate I am to have you "sort of" on my team?

734
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,320
你不喜欢我们之间的关系
You're not "happy" with our dynamic?

735
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,340
我还不喜欢你的态度
Well, I'm not happy with your attitude.

736
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,950
要说起来  也是你不把我当回事
If anything, you're taking me for granted.

737
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,540
-先生  -我们有约定  杰姬
- Sir-- - We had a deal, Jackie.

738
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,900
我很乐意履行约定
And I am perfectly willing to hold up my end of the bargain.

739
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,350
但别想错了
But do not be under any illusions.

740
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,620
这种合作关系并不平等
This is not a partnership of equals.

741
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,160
完全不平等
Nothing close to it.

742
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,380
你要是想当我的副总统  就得按我说的做
If you are to be my Vice President, you will do what I ask.

743
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,360
我们不能每次
And we will not

744
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,180
因为你对我的要求有所不情愿
have this conversation every time you feel uncomfortable

745
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,600
或不满我的行为
with what I ask you to do,

746
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,510
就要这样争执一番
or how I choose to conduct myself.

747
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,690
这就是我们的关系
That's our dynamic.

748
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,090
我们还要按原时间表来吗
Are we still sticking to the timeline?

749
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,660
对不起  我听不太清
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you.

750
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,840
我们还要按原时间表来吗  我下周退出
Are we still sticking to the timeline? I drop out next week?

751
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,530
没理由不这么做
I see no reason why you shouldn't.

752
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,640
-谢谢您  总统先生  -爱荷华见
- Thank you, Mr. President. - See you in Iowa.

753
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,230
你怎么又把头发染回金色了
Why did you change your hair back to blonde?

754
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,870
这就是你最想问的吗
That's your burning question?

755
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,930
只是好奇
I'm curious.

756
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,880
这对书有什么帮助
How does that help the book?

757
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,730
谁知道呢  但现在我什么灵感都没有
Who knows? But right now, I got nothing.

758
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
我们换回金发是因为选民更喜欢金发
We changed it because blonde polls better with the voters.

759
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,830
我们
We?

760
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,520
有一群人
There's a whole gaggle of people

761
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,210
来提议你的造型  穿着
that weigh in on how you look, and what you wear,

762
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,260
考虑活动需要什么
whether an event calls for...

763
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,080
高跟鞋  戴不戴耳环
heels, earrings, no earrings.

764
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,350
你讨厌这样  不是吗
You hate it, don't you?

765
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,970
竞选
Campaigning?

766
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,960
没人喜欢竞选过程
Everybody hates campaigning.

767
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,130
除了政客  他们能从中吸取能量
Except for the politicians. They feed off the energy.

768
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,870
还有从他们配偶那儿
And their spouses.

769
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,280
你觉得弗兰西斯在吸食我吗
You think Francis feeds off me?

770
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,090
你可正在献血呢
You are literally giving your blood.

771
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,940
很多配偶不是政客的人也献血
Plenty of people give blood who aren't married to politicians.

772
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,720
没几个人会帮刚炒了自己的人竞选
Very few people campaign for someone who just fired them.

773
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,860
他告诉你的
He tell you that?

774
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,520
他说他背叛了你
He said he betrayed you.

775
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,440
三天后  你染回金发
Three days later, you change your hair back to blonde

776
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,870
然后辞职  以便"投入竞选"
and resign so you can, quote, "devote yourself to the campaign."

777
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,420
一想就明白了
I did the math.

778
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,350
你和弗兰西斯  你们...
You and Francis, you've....

779
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,010
我们怎么
We've what?

780
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,890
他跟你说了很多
He's shared a lot.

781
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,760
会困扰你吗
Does that bother you?

782
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,020
为什么会
Why would it?

783
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,680
这也是背叛吗
Another betrayal?

784
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,400
不是
No.

785
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,480
你...
You're...

786
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,920
你没事吧
Are you okay?

787
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,600
只是有点头晕
Just a little light-headed.

788
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,800
-给  -谢谢
- Here. - Thank you.

789
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,220
我在想
I was thinking.

790
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,020
想什么
About what?

791
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,700
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood?

792
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,950
跳下去
Jumping.

793
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,560
跳下去
Jumping?

794
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,660
你有过那种感觉吗
You ever have that feeling?

795
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,480
-谈话时  -什么感觉
- Conversation? - Which feeling?

796
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,890
站在桥上  向下看...
On a bridge, you look over and...

797
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,870
往后退
step back.

798
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,010
要帮你叫人吗
Do you need me to get someone?

799
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,340
他求婚时  我说...
He proposed and I said...

800
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,230
我说七年
I said seven years.

801
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,770
七年后如果没问题  就再七年
If it's still good, another seven.

802
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,840
如果不行...
If not...

803
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,070
每七年审视一次
Every seven years.

804
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,360
我不讨厌竞选活动
I don't hate campaigning.

805
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,680
我厌恶的是...
What I hate is...

806
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,310
我有多需要我们
how much I need us.

807
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,250
你们有多需要彼此
How much you need each other?

808
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,860
我没跳下去
I didn't jump.

809
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,840
也没后退
I didn't step back.

810
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,510
我没有...
I didn't...

811
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,700
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood?

812
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,620
-怎么了  -她晕了
- What happened? - She passed out.

813
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,280
我看看  安德伍德夫人
Let me see. Mrs. Underwood?

814
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,180
能听到吗  安德伍德夫人
Can you hear me? Mrs. Underwood?

815
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,590
这三个姑娘  爸爸不是一个人还是怎么
So all these three girls, they got a different papi or what?

816
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,000
一个金发  一个红发  一个黑发
They got the blonde, they got the redhead, they got the brunette.

817
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,190
-这是《裙路口》的剧情吧  -先生
- And that's Petticoat Junction, right? - Sir?

818
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,640
-能私谈吗  -那我走了
- May we speak privately? - Oh, let me let y'all be.

819
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,030
别啊  弗莱迪  你故事正讲到一半
No, Freddie. You're in the middle of your story.

820
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,560
先生  我想跟你私谈
Sir, if you don't mind.

821
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,300
-是机密吗  -不是
- Is it classified? - No, it is not.

822
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,640
那就说
Then talk.

823
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,840
杰姬刚来我办公室  她很沮丧
Jackie just stopped by my office. She's upset.

824
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,180
我觉得我们该更照顾她的想法
I think we need to take her views more into consideration.

825
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,680
她在无理取闹
She's being ridiculous.

826
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,610
我觉得她挺有道理
I think she made some valid points.

827
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,680
你为我还是为她工作
Who do you work for, me or her?

828
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,820
我只是想转达她的担忧
I'm just trying to communicate her concerns.

829
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,850
她最好照说照做  你也是
She'd better get in line and so had you.

830
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,980
如果总要费时间跟下属解释
I'm never gonna win if I have to spend my time

831
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,670
我是赢不了的
explaining myself to my subordinates.

832
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,220
-我还是走吧  -别  弗莱迪  坐下
- Look, let me let you-- - No, no. Now, Freddy, sit down.

833
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,830
记得我们谈过你是怎样对待下属的吗
Do you remember when we talked about how you treat your staff?

834
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,730
你想获胜吗
You want to win?

835
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,300
没有他们  你绝对做不到
You sure as hell won't do it without any of them.

836
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,130
你继续这样  他们都会离开
You keep on like this, you won't have any of them left.

837
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:41,520
你想谈忠诚吗
Are you talking about loyalty?

838
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,200
我只接受无条件的忠诚
The only brand of that I accept is unconditional.

839
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,840
-做不到就...  -这应该做收费节目
- Anything less is a-- - Y'all should put this on pay-per-view.

840
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,420
你个头挺大  但这家伙
But you. You a big guy. But this sucker,

841
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,190
我见过他吃肋排狼吞虎咽的样子
I've seen him go through a rack of ribs like it was wet tissue.

842
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,210
你赌谁赢
Who'd you put your money on?

843
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,800
我才不会上当
Oh, I'm not gonna fall into that trap.

844
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,670
-当然是你  -先生  您妻子出事了
- You. - Sir? It's your wife.

845
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,400
-她献血晕过去了  -什么
- She passed out giving blood. - What?

846
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,690
没什么大碍  但耶茨先生打过来了
She's okay, but, uh, Mr. Yates is on the line.

847
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,450
我在私人书房接
I'll take it in my private study.

848
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,010
你这么顶撞他毫无益处
Don't do no good callin' a man out like that.

849
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:18,040
这就像怪蛇有毒牙
It's like... blamin' a snake for having fangs.

850
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,340
我忍不住
I couldn't help myself.

851
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,990
-能帮我个忙吗  -什么
- Could you do me a favor? - What's that?

852
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,720
帮我打掩护  他让我陪但我还有工作
Cover for me. I got work to do and he needs company.

853
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,080
原来在餐馆  我听腻了
Back at the ribs joint, I could just walk back in the kitchen

854
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,070
就回厨房干活儿
when I got tired of hearing him talk.

855
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:34,100
-好  我就说你上司来了  -谢谢  伙计
- Yeah. I'll tell him your boss came over. - Thank you, brother.

856
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,300
让她接我电话
Put her on the phone with me.

857
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,420
她不让我打电话  但我觉得应该打
She didn't want me to call, but I thought I should.

858
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,460
-她在旁边吗  -她好像是不好意思
- Well, is she nearby? - I think she's embarrassed.

859
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,180
我可是她丈夫
I'm her husband.

860
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,400
护士在照顾她
The nurses are with her.

861
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,670
也许你还是再等等吧
Maybe you should just hold off for a few minutes.

862
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,380
让她的安保队长立刻送她上飞机
Tell the head of her detail to get her on the plane right away.

863
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,550
她得回来看白宫的医生
She has to come back here and see the White House physician.

864
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,200
我猜如果取消活动的话
My guess is she'd be even more embarrassed

865
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,570
她会更不好意思
if she had to cancel her events.

866
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,120
这跟她的感受无关
This isn't about how she feels.

867
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,640
这是为她好
This is about what's best for her.

868
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,830
她不需要看医生  她需要你
She doesn't need a doctor. She needs you.

869
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,250
这是什么意思
What do you mean?

870
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,070
她说了些话  说到七年一次
She said some things, about every seven years.

871
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,200
还有站在桥边
About being in limbo, on the edge of a bridge.

872
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,130
听着  就因为我告诉过你
Listen, just because I may have shared with you

873
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,720
一些我们婚姻的事
a few things about our marriage

874
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,980
并不代表你可以指手画脚
does not give you the right to interfere with it.

875
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,920
让她好点了给我打电话
Now, please have her call me when she's ready.

876
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,230
结束了
Well... this is it.

877
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,200
-60天  -60天
- Sixty days. - Sixty days.

878
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,920
那电影吓死我了
That movie freaked me out.

879
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,900
全世界可以在60天内分崩离析
The whole world can fall apart in sixty days.

880
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,890
也可以让人彻底戒酒
Or a guy can get sober.

881
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,990
昨晚睡前我洗了十分钟的手
I washed my hands for ten minutes last night before bed.

882
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,900
你把我从酒鬼改造成了洁癖
You turned me from an alcoholic to a germaphobe.

883
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,160
这交易你不吃亏
That's not a bad trade-off.

884
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,330
过去我自己度过的14年
The 14 years I got by on my own...

885
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,440
跟与你一起度过的这八周比
they mean nothing compared to the last eight weeks

886
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,690
根本一文不值
you've been here with me.

887
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,570
换做是我你也会这么做
You would have done the same for me.

888
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,270
我希望我能做到
I'd like to think so.

889
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,840
你会的
Know so.

890
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,540
我爱你  哥哥
I love you, brother.

891
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,440
到了给我打电话
Call me when you land.

892
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,920
老天  你简直跟萨拉一样
Jesus, you sound like Sarah.

893
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,990
我们要在阔德城
So we want to focus on ad-buys

894
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,260
投放更多广告  在得梅因减少投放量
more in the Quad Cities market, less so in Des Moines.

895
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,510
你在东部的支持率更高
You're stronger in the East

896
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,440
我们得巩固那里的领先地位
and we want to turn our twos there into ones.

897
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,370
辩论之后  "愿景"这个口号
The "vision" message really resonated

898
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,930
在焦点小组中引起很大共鸣
in our focus groups post-debate,

899
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:22,370
我认为我们应该针对此拍个新广告
so I think we should cut a new ad centered on that

900
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,960
并把它纳入竞选宣传
and weave it into the stump.

901
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,620
先生
Sir?

902
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,470
抱歉  什么
I'm sorry, what?

903
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:31,850
如果我们把竞选宣传的主题
Are you good if we change the stump

904
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,110
换成"愿景"  您没意见吧
to focus on the "vision" theme?

905
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,500
我想明天一早去新罕布什尔
I want to go to New Hampshire tomorrow, first thing.

906
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,830
您的行程安排是去爱荷华州
We have you going to Iowa.

907
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,540
我知道  但我想更改计划
I know, but I want to change the schedule.

908
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:42,540
任何人竞选时  都得停下脚步评估形势
In every campaign, there comes a time for taking stock.

909
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,280
自我反省
A time for soul-searching. And...

910
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,840
在过去的24小时里  我就是那么做的
in the past 24 hours, I have done just that.

911
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,750
而我的决定如下
And the conclusion that I have come to is this:

912
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,260
如果目标是建立一个更安全  兴盛的美国
If the goal is a safer, more prosperous America,

913
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,960
并不非得我参选才能实现
I don't need to run for us to achieve that.

914
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:05,360
我需要做的  我也鼓励我的支持者做的
All I need to do and what I encourage all of my supporters to do

915
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,490
就是支持希瑟·邓巴成为美国总统
is to help elect Heather Dunbar to the White House.

916
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,760
-叛徒婊子  -虽然我的竞选结束了
- Judas bitch. - While I may be ending my camp--

917
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,470
我就是生气  如果冒犯你了我很抱歉
I'm just pissed off. I'm sorry if I offended.

918
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,310
不知道她给了她什么好处
Yeah, I wonder what she offered her.

919
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,830
什么都没有
Nothing.

920
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,560
得了
Yeah, right.

921
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,370
我确定
I know for a fact.

922
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,180
这事你早就知道吗
You knew about this?

923
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,780
你应该给总统打电话
You should call the President.

924
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,560
"一只浑身是毛  超级可怕的狼蛛  名叫蒂娜
"A very hairy, terribly scary tarantula named Tina.

925
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,460
我是在纽约一个鞋盒里发现她的
I found her in a shoebox in New York City.

926
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,140
我刚发现蒂娜时吓得直叫"
When I first saw Tina I shrieked..."

927
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,760
你害怕吗
Were you scared?

928
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,000
我吓死了
Oh, I was terribly scared.

929
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,440
"蒂娜从左脚的鞋里伸出头来"
"Tina had poked her head up out of the left shoe..."

930
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,530
-我不知道你要来  -她也不知道
- I didn't know you were coming. - She doesn't either.

931
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,370
"所以我呆在那儿  不知道该怎么办
"So there I was, not knowing what to believe.

932
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,210
我该让蒂娜待在鞋盒里还是放她出来"
Should I leave Tina in the shoebox or set Tina free?"

933
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,380
-把她留在鞋盒里  -放她出来
- Leave her in the box! - Set her free!

934
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,160
-放她出来  -把她留在鞋盒里
- Set her free! - Leave her in the box!

935
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,830
我的天  我不知道该怎么办
Oh, my Goodness! I don't know what to do!

936
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,380
什么都不做  不要管她
Nothing! Do nothing!

937
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,800
-我该怎么办  -先生  格雷森先生找您
- What should I do? - Sir, Mr. Grayson needs to speak with you.

938
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,950
-告诉他我会打回去  -他说这事很重要
- Tell him I'll call him back. - He says it's important.

939
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,890
之后再说  我在陪我夫人
Later. I'm with my wife.

940
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,550
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do!

941
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,100
你什么都不该做
You shouldn't do anything.

942
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,710
-放她出来  -什么都不做吗
- Let her out! - Don't do anything?

944
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:26,170
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国总统选举  从两党候选人宣布参选  到党内初选
再到最后普选投票  整个过程往往要持续一年半多
在这漫长的一年半中  最戏剧化的环节  就是候选人电视辩论
在党内初选阶段  参加辩论的人数比较多  电视辩论的次数也比较多
电视辩论一般由两党的全国委员会组织筹划  由各大电视台主持
在2012年的大选中  共和党初选阶段共举行了多达20场的电视辩论
由于在初选辩论中党内候选人彼此攻击过于激烈  导致初选结束后
最后胜出的候选人在普选阶段面对对立党派的对手时
已经伤痕累累  落了下风
所以在即将到来的2016总统大选中
共和党全国委员会决定减少电视辩论次数

946
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:51,170
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}初选结束后  两党各自提名一名候选人在普选中出战对垒
普选阶段的电视辩论一般只有四场
三场为总统候选人辩论  一场为副总统候选人辩论
辩论的组织工作由专门的总统选举电视辩论委员会负责
在2012年大选中  三场总统辩论中的第一场最为精彩
一向自诩口才出众的奥巴马  由于过于轻敌
在辩论前没有认真准备  而是跑去参观胡佛水坝
结果在辩论开始后被对手罗姆尼占尽上风
在整场辩论中始终处于绝对劣势
辩论结束后  一直在民调中落后的罗姆尼开始反超奥巴马
可惜后来因飓风等因素  罗姆尼将在辩论中获得的优势又拱手让出
