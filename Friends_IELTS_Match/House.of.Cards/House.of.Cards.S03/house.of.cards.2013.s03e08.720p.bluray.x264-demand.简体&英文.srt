When surface temperatures in the Atlantic rise above 80 degrees,

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,340
是飓风形成的理想条件
conditions are ideal for a hurricane.

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,550
西风激起冷凝作用
Westerly winds kick up condensation,

22
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,440
生成绕中央轴旋转的积雨云
forming cumulonimbus clouds which begin to revolve around a central axis.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,400
9月7日  以上条件生成了飓风费斯
On September seventh, these exact conditions gave birth to the Hurricane Faith.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,270
现在正向美国东海岸推进
currently barreling toward the Eastern seaboard of the United States.

1984年11月7日
On November 7th, 1984,

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,980
生成了另一种类型的飓风
a different sort of hurricane swirled into being.

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,050
一个25岁的哈佛法学院毕业生
A 25-year-old Harvard Law graduate

28
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,880
席卷了南卡罗莱纳州州参议院第14区
took South Carolina State Senate District Fourteen by storm.

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,930
他的名字是弗兰西斯·J·安德伍德
His name was Francis J. Underwood.

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,720
飓风登陆的话有多强
How strong will it be when it hits?

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,690
模拟软件显示有三级  甚至四级
Simulators say Cat Three, possibly Cat Four.

32
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,280
将给数十个州造成极大破坏
Major devastation across a dozen states.

33
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,380
但有些模拟路线显示可能会转向大海
Yes, but some of these projections have it turning back to sea.

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,360
不太可能  先生
That's highly unlikely, sir.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,890
先生  联邦应急管理署就是要为最坏情况做打算
Sir, FEMA's mission is to prepare for the worst.

36
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,170
现场急救员  医疗  大面积撤离
First responders, medical, mass evacuation.

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,120
我很担心资金问题
I'm worried about the funding.

38
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,190
《美就法》启动后  联邦应急管理署赈灾资金
The Disaster Relief Fund has been depleted by a third

39
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,300
耗掉了三分之一
since you launched AmWorks.

40
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,690
那还有二十亿
That still leaves two billion.

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,500
应对这种级别的飓风  我们需要四倍的资金
Well, for this storm, we need four times that.

42
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,000
我这就要去见领导层
I'm about to meet with the leadership

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,310
请他们补充资金
to ask them to replenish the fund,

44
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,510
但我不能要那么多钱
but I can't ask for that much.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,880
我们需要最少八十亿的基础准备资金
We need eight billion minimum for bare-bones preparation.

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,920
我们还是不要冒这种险  先生
We shouldn't gamble with something like this, sir.

47
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,270
成百上千的人可能会丧命
Hundreds could die. Maybe thousands.

48
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,890
"不可能成了可能
"The impossible made possible.

49
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,580
无人敢做的事
The thing no one else dares to do,

50
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,000
所有人都说办不到的事
that everyone says can't be done.

51
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,190
设想一下  一个男孩站在查尔斯顿港海边
Imagine a boy standing on the shores of the Charleston Harbor.

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,710
两英里开外  隐约能看到萨姆特堡
Two miles away, a faint line on the horizon, is Fort Sumter.

53
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,430
其他男孩都说不可能游到那里去
All the other boys say it's impossible to swim there.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,720
但这个男孩  却觉得能做到
But this one boy thinks it can be done.

55
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,540
周围人都倒吸一口冷气  看着他脱下鞋
The others gasp as he kicks off his shoes,

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,850
跳入海里
plunges into the water.

57
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,060
他们吃惊地看着他越游越远
They watch with shock as he grows farther from the shore.

58
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
他们紧张地交头接耳
They whisper to each other solemnly,

59
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,900
'他会淹死  他办不到的'
'He'll drown. He'll never make it.'

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,440
'不  他游不下去时会掉头的'"
'No, he'll turn around when it gets too hard.'"

61
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,290
总统先生
Mr. President.

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,640
请坐  我叫杰西卡送点喝的来
Have a seat. I'll have Jessica bring in some refreshments.

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,670
亨利·米切尔  新任参议院多数党领袖
Henry Mitchell, the new Senate Majority Leader.

64
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,210
赫克特·门多萨怎么了
What happened to Hector Mendoza?

65
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,050
你不把有偿演讲当作收入上报
Well, you don't declare a couple of paid speeches as income

66
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,930
你转眼就被踢出国会了
and boom, you're no longer in Congress,

67
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,630
当然也就不能参加总统选举了
and certainly not running for president.

68
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,830
你把罗尼那幅画扔了  赫克特很喜欢那幅画
You got rid of Ronnie. Hector loved that painting.

69
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,950
没扔  只是放起来了
He's not gone, just in storage.

70
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,090
赫克特也去积灰了
Just like Hector.

71
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,090
我父亲在艾森豪威尔手下卖命
My father served under Eisenhower.

72
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,550
在诺曼底给他开吉普车
Drove his jeep in Normandy.

73
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,900
你父亲参加登陆日了吗
Your father was at D-Day?

74
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,860
犹他海滩  还有巴斯托涅
Utah Beach. At Bastogne too.

75
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,130
真是爱意满满啊
Isn't this just a little love fest.

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,670
先生们  飓风问题  我需要补充赈灾资金
Gentlemen, the hurricane. I need the DRF replenished.

77
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,990
议长今晚将召开紧急会议
The Speaker's calling for an emergency session tonight.

78
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,230
我们准备拨出一百亿资金
We're prepared to allocate ten billion.

79
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,550
我本只想要八十亿
I was only gonna ask for eight.

80
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,350
签了法案  就有一百亿
You sign the bill, you'll get the ten billion.

81
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,150
但联邦应急管理署或者其他机构的资金
But no FEMA money or any other agency funds can be used

82
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,090
在任何情况下都不能再给你的就业法案了
for your jobs program again, under any circumstances.

83
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,760
别把这事扯到政治上去
Don't politicize this.

84
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,890
《美国就业法案》和飓风是两码事
America Works and the hurricane are two separate issues.

85
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,040
不好意思  总统先生
Excuse me, Mr. President,

86
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,960
是你把赈灾资金用于了政治用途
but you're the one that raided the DRF for political purposes.

87
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,550
我们是在纠正错误
We're correcting a wrong.

88
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,100
还危及到整个东海岸
And jeopardizing the entire Eastern Seaboard.

89
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,200
这得怪白宫  与我们无关
That's on the White House, not on us.

90
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
我们会补充资金  填补被你非法挪用的钱
We're supplying the funds, the money you took illegally.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,440
你要是不签这个法案  也怪不了我们
If you choose not to sign the bill, we can't be blamed.

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,520
我们提过议了
We stepped up.

93
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,370
我就猜你们会扯上《美国就业法案》
I thought you might try to make this about America Works.

94
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,400
我承认  我也许是过线了
And look, I admit, I may have overstepped.

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,190
不过  我给你们看点东西
But let me show you something.

96
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,200
每天我都让新闻部
Every day, I ask the Comms office

97
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,370
给我十份《美国就业法案》受益人的介绍
to give me profiles of ten AmWorks beneficiaries.

98
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,880
这些是成功案例
These are success stories.

99
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,310
这只是我们
This is just a fraction

100
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,320
帮助重回岗位的四万人中的一小部分
of the 40,000 people that we put back to work.

101
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,470
用本来不是做这个的钱
With money that wasn't appropriated for that purpose.

102
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,690
你不可以把扑满打破后
You don't get to break the piggy bank

103
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,840
还让我们粘回去  再往里放更多的钱
then ask us to glue it together and put in more pennies.

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,240
参众两院有超过五十名民主党及共和党议员
I've got over 50 Democrats and Republicans in both houses

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,580
在法案提出后
that have publicly supported

106
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,940
公开表示支持《美国就业法案》
America Works since its introduction.

107
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,350
风头变了
The tide is turning.

108
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,430
你们自己人都在支持法案
Your own people are getting behind the program.

109
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,460
他们现在在哪  为什么没人打电话给我们
Then where are they now? Why aren't we getting calls?

110
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,120
他们为什么都支持这一应急法案
Why do they all support this emergency bill?

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,610
如果你们投票通过  我就会行使否决权
If you pass it, I'll veto it,

112
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,580
可这样斗气毫无意义
but there's no reason we have to turn this into a pissing match.

113
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,470
你知道我们有足够票数推翻你的否决
You know that we have the votes to override your veto.

114
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,310
就算你不签字  十天之后也会通过
It passes in ten days without a signature, regardless.

115
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,750
唯一的区别
The only question

116
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,110
是你会在飓风到来之前签字同意
is whether you're gonna sign it before that hurricane hits,

117
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,980
还是在数千人死去之后看着法案通过
or watch it become law after thousands have died.

118
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,400
亨利
Henry...

119
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,740
我曾与赫克特
I sat with Hector

120
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,670
数十次坐在这张桌子旁边
dozens of times at this very table

121
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,250
通过谈判
and we were always able

122
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,300
解决我们的争端
to work out our differences, to negotiate.

123
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,330
这已经不再是赫克特的办公室
This isn't Hector's office anymore.

124
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,630
或是他的桌子了
Or his table.

125
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,050
先生们  没有回旋的余地了吗
Gentlemen, is there no room for a compromise?

126
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,310
-没有  -鲍勃
- No. - Bob?

127
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,670
没有了  总统先生
No, Mr. President.

128
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,390
消息一小时后就会发布
It's going wide in an hour.

129
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,870
七位州长  整个东海岸上下
Seven governors, all up and down the East Coast.

130
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,530
都要求您签字同意
They're demanding that you sign the bill.

131
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,770
-谁告诉你的  -吉姆·马修斯的宣传员
- Who tipped you off? - Jim Matthews' flack.

132
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,000
马修斯背叛我们了吗  怎么说的
Matthews is turning on us? What's it say?

133
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,260
"安德伍德总统低估了分权制度
"President Underwood has undermined the separation of powers

134
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
并将整个东海岸的命运
and put the fate of the entire East Coast

135
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,810
交予飓风费斯之手
in Hurricane Faith's hands.

136
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,010
我与以下各位州长
I am joining with the Governors

137
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,210
北卡罗来纳  维吉尼亚  马里兰..."
of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland--"

138
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,910
够了  我不用再听了
That's enough. I don't need to hear any more.

139
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,730
看三十分钟内你能联系到多少位州长
See how many governors you can get on the phone in 30 minutes.

140
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,960
-好的  -我还有东西给您
- Yes, sir. - I've got something else for you, sir.

141
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,090
《美就法》个案  这是今天的十位
The AmWorks case studies. These are your ten for the day.

142
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,270
-我现在没时间看  -您该看看第一份
- I don't have time for that now. - You should see this top file.

143
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,020
弗莱迪现在是一名洗碗工
Freddy's working as a dishwasher.

144
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,320
他是最早注册的人之一
He was one of the first people to sign up.

145
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,540
我要写一份声明回应这些州长吗
Should I prepare a statement in response to the governors?

146
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,910
先生
Sir?

147
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,920
不用写声明  暂时不用
No statement. No. Not yet.

148
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,040
好的
Yes, sir.

149
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,910
-先生  -给全体内阁发消息
- Yes, sir? - Send a message to the entire cabinet.

150
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,620
明天一早就开个会
I want a meeting tomorrow morning, first thing.

151
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,620
"众所周知
"During his tenure as whip,

152
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,470
安德伍德担任党鞭期间常采取恐吓
Underwood was known for employing intimidation,

153
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,170
虚张声势和威慑等手段
bravado and fear.

154
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,580
他最近对俄罗斯采取的立场
His recent stance against Russia

155
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,180
延续了他一贯的暴力外交手段
is a continuation of strong-arm diplomacy,

156
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,760
他顶着参议院反对所任命的联合国大使
carried out by his wife, whom he appointed UN ambassador

157
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,950
他妻子执行了他的策略
despite the Senate voting her down.

158
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,260
用联邦应急管理署资金资助《美国就业法案》
The use of FEMA funds for America Works

159
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,180
令很多人震惊
shocked many,

160
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,920
但这只是他职业生涯中
but it's simply the most recent

161
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,730
一贯独断专行作风的最新案例
in a career's worth of unilateral moves.

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,650
少数党领袖鲍勃·博奇说 
Minority Leader Bob Birch said,

163
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,810
总统的行为一直体现出
'The President consistently demonstrates an utter

164
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,490
他的缺乏合作精神和恣意妄为"
lack of partnership coupled with reckless abandon.'"

165
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,830
先生  您考虑过
Sir, have you given any thought

166
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,140
直接在国会昨晚通过的法案上签字吗
to simply signing the bill that Congress passed last night?

167
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,300
有多少人认为我该签字的
How many of you think I should sign the bill?

168
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,390
肯定有人认为我该签字
Well, surely, some of you think I should.

169
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,650
我觉得
You know, I think too often,

170
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,990
这房间里的人经常怕得罪我
the people in this room are afraid of upsetting me.

171
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,420
这都怪我
And that's my fault.

172
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,530
事情不如我意时
I discourage dissent when

173
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,360
我会打击异见者
it doesn't go with the things that I want.

174
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,760
我希望你们坦诚  我不会记仇
So, I want you to be honest with me. I won't hold it against you.

175
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,010
你们有多少人觉得我该签法案
How many of you think I should sign the bill?

176
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,740
谢谢
Thank you.

177
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,800
大家都为《美就法》的启动运作付出了很大努力
You have all worked very hard to get AmWorks up and running.

178
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,870
还没竭尽全力  想尽办法
I don't want to sign its death warrant

179
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,840
我不想就这么给就业法案判了死刑
until we have exhausted every resource available to us first.

180
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,470
每个部门都给我起草
So I need every department to draft a proposal

181
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,500
一份如何应对飓风的提议
of what they could do in response to the hurricane.

182
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,250
如果钱还不够  我就签法案
And if we still fall short, I'll sign the bill.

183
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,330
各位同意吗
Is that okay with everyone?

184
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,420
就看后天了  感谢大家
Let's aim for the day after tomorrow. Thank you all very much.

185
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,330
沃尔玛员工的起薪
The starting salary for an employee at Walmart

186
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,480
低于贫困线
is below the poverty line.

187
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,050
美国政府每年补贴
Now, the American government subsidizes Walmart

188
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,060
沃尔玛达78亿美元
to the tune of 7.8 billion dollars a year,

189
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,600
给超过一成的员工
by issuing food stamps to

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,180
发放食品救济券
over one in ten of its workers.

191
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,700
但过分的是
But here's the scary part.

192
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,300
15%的食品券是用在沃尔玛的
Fifteen percent of all food stamps are actually used at Walmart.

193
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,930
相当于沃尔玛
Meaning Walmart

194
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,840
从联邦政府金库拿了双份的钱
gets to double dip into the federal government's coffers.

195
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,690
我和你们一样愤怒
I'm as angry about it as you are.

196
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,700
因为沃尔玛的高管们在过去六年中
Because Walmart's top executives have reaped

197
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,050
攫取了
almost 300 million

198
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,220
大约三亿的免税绩效工资
in tax-deductible performance pay over the last six years.

199
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,190
这一切要到此为止了
That needs to stop!

200
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,050
我们得提高最低工资
We need to raise the minimum wage!

201
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,580
控制奖金  削减企业暴利
Cut down on corporate greed by regulating bonuses.

202
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,840
天平该平衡一下了
It's time to balance the scales.

203
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,840
我们要过一遍通告单吗
Can we go through your call sheet?

204
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,010
先让我缓一下
Just give me a second to decompress.

205
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,900
下场活动只有半小时了
We've only got a half hour until the next event.

206
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,850
-道格打过电话吗  -你演讲时打的
- Doug called? - While you were giving your speech.

207
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,070
-什么事  -他没说
- What about? - He wouldn't say.

208
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,950
锡达拉皮兹市情况如何
How'd it go in Cedar Rapids?

209
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,580
不错  拿下了州县和市政工人联合会
Well. We got AFSCME on board.

210
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,930
来人很多  什么事
Good turnout. What's up?

211
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,540
夏普明天在迪比克市有活动
Sharp has an event in Dubuque tomorrow.

212
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,340
你明天日程也是去那儿
You're scheduled to be there too.

213
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,150
-怎么  -跟她见面
- And? - Meet with her.

214
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,570
-地方要隐秘  -为什么
- Somewhere discreet. - Why?

215
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,140
我们认定安德伍德会参选
If we assume that Underwood is running, and we do,

216
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,600
也得认定夏普是他的人
we should also assume that Sharp is on his team.

217
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,180
你没有回答我的问题
That doesn't answer the question.

218
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,550
辛西娅肯定会反对  你好  辛西娅
I'm sure that Cynthia will object. Hello, Cynthia.

219
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,540
-你好  道格  -反对什么
- Hello, Doug. - Object to what?

220
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,620
你得跟夏普谈飓风的事
You're going to talk to Sharp about the hurricane.

221
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,410
...被视为帮助普通老百姓
...that are perceived as helping average citizens

222
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,030
争取更多权力
feel more empowered.

223
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,220
这项法案的主要反对者都有谁
Who are some of the bill's key opponents

224
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,730
国会内部的消息走向又如何
and what are hearing in their on floor messaging?

225
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,630
如果白宫如果威胁否决
Well, the White House would be the most prominent opponent

226
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,300
肯定是最大的反对者
if they slap the veto threat on this, saying it's--

227
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,350
-谢谢  辛西娅  -你都在午夜健身吗
- Oh. Thank you, Cynthia. - You usually work out at midnight?

228
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,320
只有健身的时候
My workout is the only time of day

229
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,220
记者团才不来打扰我
the press corps gives me some privacy.

230
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,750
-今晚的活动怎么样  -还不错
- How did your event go tonight? - Fine.

231
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,030
我在一个老朋友家中玩了半小时游戏
I called bingo for half an hour at an old folks' home.

232
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,470
那不错啊  换换口味
Well, that's pretty good. Something a little different.

233
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,830
抄了我联邦应急管理署法案的
You gonna steal it the way you stole

234
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,890
谈话要点  又准备学这一招吗
my talking points on the FEMA bill?

235
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,160
你点子好
You made good points.

236
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,180
对手要是正确  我也愿意拥护
I'm not above agreeing with the opposition when they're right.

237
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,710
但我没想到你立场这么鲜明
But I'm surprised you've been so critical.

238
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,900
我以为你和安德伍德关系很好
I thought you and Underwood were close.

239
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,670
盟友如果犯错  我也会表示反对
I'm not above disagreeing with an ally when they're wrong.

240
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,490
既然要做正确的事
In the spirit of what's right,

241
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,790
我想告诉你  我要暂停竞选活动
I want you to know I'm suspending my campaign.

242
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,850
飓风登陆后
When the storm makes landfall,

243
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,140
我会呼吁大家捐款给红十字会  而不是我
I'm going to ask people to donate to the Red Cross instead.

244
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,300
我还会去东海岸做志愿者
And I'll be heading out east to volunteer.

245
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,040
听起来不像是暂停
That doesn't sound like a suspension.

246
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,580
倒像是投机
That sounds like opportunism.

247
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,360
不  我会叫媒体不要报导
No. I'll ask the press to leave me be.

248
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,410
我不能强迫他们  但我们不会提供后勤支持
I can't force them to, but we won't offer any logistical support.

249
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,830
你希望我也暂停
You want me to suspend as well?

250
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,860
我们可以一起宣布
We can announce together.

251
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,620
这样其中的政治味就没那么浓了
That takes the politics out of this.

252
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,350
从世俗的角度  我认为这对你有利
The cynical side of me thinks that it benefits you

253
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,860
如果我刚步入正轨  就停止筹款
if I stop my fundraising right when I'm hitting my stride.

254
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,510
我不是想说服世俗的你
Well, I'm not appealing to the cynical side.

255
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,980
你继续健身吧
I'll leave you to your workout.

256
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,410
你现在可是有孩子的人
You have kids now.

257
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,970
我有丈夫  他有孩子
I have a husband. He has kids.

258
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,620
你不把他们看作你自己的孩子吗
You don't consider them your own?

259
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,060
已经很晚了  希瑟
It's late, Heather.

260
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,780
我提这事  是因为他们让我脚踏实地
I bring it up because they ground me.

261
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,140
我不知道你
I don't know if you've

262
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,560
结婚之后  有没有这种感觉
felt this way since you got married, but...

263
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,870
当我想到我的孩子还有这场飓风
when I think about my kids and this hurricane...

264
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,760
如果我们既没钱也没地位呢
What if we didn't have the money and advantages we do?

265
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,250
如果他们遭灾了呢
What if they were in harm's way?

266
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,040
如果他们需要帮助却得不到呢
What if they needed help and didn't have it?

267
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,070
这让我看清了一切
Puts everything into perspective for me.

268
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,450
这场竞选显得毫无意义
This... campaign seems meaningless.

269
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,910
在他们的安康面前苍白无力
It pales in comparison to their well-being.

270
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,740
你有过这种感觉吗
Have you felt that at all?

271
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,370
自从你成为母亲
Since you became a mother?

272
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,240
"与州政府磋商"太干巴巴了
"Consulting with state governments" is way too dry.

273
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,470
换成"密切合作"
Put in "Working closely."

274
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,890
-你不觉得太虚伪吗  -为什么
- Don't you think that's disingenuous? - Why?

275
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,580
这七位州长刚刚公开谴责了总统
These seven governors just publicly condemned the president.

276
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,450
"密切合作"
"Working closely"?

277
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,940
我也天天谴责你但还是跟你密切合作
Well, I condemn you every day but I still work closely with you.

278
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,780
这个电话我得接
So, I need to take this phone call.

279
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,340
润色一下  再拿给我
Punch it up, bring it back to me.

280
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,070
-道格  -我有个口信给总统
- Doug? - I have a message for the president.

281
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,460
是什么
What is it?

282
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,070
告诉他杰姬和邓巴今晚在迪比克市碰过面
Tell him Jackie and Dunbar met in Dubuque tonight.

283
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,210
告诉他是我告诉你的
And tell him I'm the one who told you.

284
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,150
她们为何碰面
What did they meet about?

285
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,880
在飓风到后她们要暂停竞选活动
Suspending their campaigns after the hurricane hits.

286
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,300
-你怎么知道的  -告诉他就行
- How do you know this? - Just tell him.

287
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,120
你在秘密为杰姬工作吗
Are you working for Jackie, under the radar?

288
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,070
-不是  -为邓巴
- No. - Dunbar?

289
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,180
我仅仅是为总统着想
I'm just looking out for the president.

290
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,920
告诉他这个消息还有消息的来源
Give him the information and tell him who it came from.

291
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,970
有进一步消息我通知你
I'll let you know if I learn more.

292
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,400
"海水冰冷  水流湍急
"The water was cold and the current was strong.

293
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,710
男孩每次划水都必须击退寒冷
With every stroke, the boy had to fight off chills

294
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,480
抵抗大海涌来的激流
and battle the tide rushing in from the sea.

295
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,730
从海岸上望着他的同学们
Anyone watching him, as his schoolmates did from the shore,

296
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,380
几乎辨认不出水面上缓慢移动的小点
barely making out a tiny speck moving slowly across the water,

297
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,550
都觉得他没希望了
would've thought he stood no chance.

298
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,830
但男孩从未这么想过
But that thought never entered the boy's mind.

299
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,650
他肌肉酸痛  心跳剧烈
His muscles ached, his heart pounded,

300
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,920
但海水无法将他打败"
but the water would not defeat him."

301
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,560
我想利用体育馆和市政厅
I want rec centers and town halls,

302
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,810
但最重要的是学校
but the most important thing is schools.

303
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,800
它们是关键所在
They're the key.

304
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,090
俄亥俄以东的每所学校
Well, every school east of Ohio.

305
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,500
告诉那些不同意的州长
You tell the governors that push back,

306
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,720
我们会用赈灾资金余款
tell them we'll pay for the shutdown days

307
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,750
补偿停摆和加班损失
and overtime with what's left in the DRF.

308
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,280
不  我们会想出
No, we'll figure out how to

309
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,650
用其他部门把人转移过去的办法
get people there through some other department.

310
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,720
先搞定学校
Just get me the schools!

311
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,070
我一直告诉他们别给我送那个了
I keep telling them to stop bringing those.

312
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,680
我知道  是我给你的
I know. I got these myself.

313
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,040
谢谢  你真贴心
Oh, thank you. That's sweet.

314
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,640
-有进展了吗  -有点  但还不够
- Any progress? - Some, but not enough.

315
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,640
你今天举手是真心的吗
Did you mean it today, when you raised your hand?

316
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,910
不是
No.

317
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,360
但我知道如果我举手
But I knew if I did,

318
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,470
那些想举手的就不会那么害怕了
the others who wanted to would be less afraid.

319
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,650
那边的就是法案吗
Is that it? The bill?

320
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,660
是  内阁会议刚开完就送来了
Yes. They delivered it just after the cabinet meeting.

321
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,300
也许我该签了这破法案
Maybe I should just sign the damn thing.

322
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,120
我拖得越久  对我的怨气就越大
The longer I wait, the bigger target I become.

323
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,570
内阁努力着呢
Well, the cabinet's working hard.

324
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,540
你坚持一下  给他们点时间
Stick to your guns and give them some time.

325
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,200
没准会拐弯  或者直接消散了
Well, it could turn. Or dissipate.

326
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,440
飓风温贝托和飓风费斯的轨迹一样
Hurricane Humberto was on the same trajectory as Faith.

327
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,180
大家都以为温贝托会夷平七个州
Everyone thought that was gonna wipe out seven states,

328
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,010
结果最后拐了个弯  向南去了
but in the end, it turned south

329
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,320
最大风级才一级
and never became more than a Cat One.

330
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,390
-有多大可能会拐弯  -可能性很小
- How good are the chances? - Extremely poor.

331
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,940
不过  希望还是有的
But... there's still some hope.

332
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,930
放松一下吧  弗兰西斯
Relax for a minute, Francis.

333
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,220
应该取消明天的联合国维和部队出征仪式
We should cancel the UN ceremony tomorrow.

334
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,470
-什么  -也许这有些不合时宜
- What? - Maybe it sends the wrong message.

335
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,970
不  这是你的大胜利  是我们的胜利
No, it's a great victory for you. For us.

336
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,940
但是大灾当前却还开庆典...
But celebrating in the middle of a crisis, I don't--

337
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,070
这种时候我们就该这么做
Well, that's exactly what we should be doing.

338
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,150
你促成了这个决议案
You made this resolution happen.

339
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,040
这是我们搬进白宫之后
It's the one good notch we have

340
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,120
取得的仅有的一桩像样的成绩
on our belt since we moved into the White House.

341
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,610
我绝不会让这飓风抢走我们庆祝的机会
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let this hurricane rob us of that.

342
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,020
"当国会拒绝支持向约旦河谷
"When Congress refused to support a peacekeeping mission

343
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,200
派驻维和部队后  总统还是派出了部队
in the Jordan Valley, the president deployed troops anyway,

彰显他作为三军统帅的权威"
stating his authority as Commander in Chief."

"The ramparts of the fort were still a mile away.

但他已经游得太远  进退不得
But he had reached the point of no return.

掉头回去已经不可能了"
Turning back was no longer an option."

"全世界都在关注着他
"With the world's eyes upon him,

他继续无视种种先例
he continues to ignore precedent,

常规  甚至有人觉得他无视法律"
convention, and some would say the law."

351
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,800
"他为什么要跨越那条隐形的返回线
"Why did he cross that invisible line?

为什么甘冒生命危险
Why risk his life

哪怕成功的几率是如此之低"
despite the great odds stacked against him?"

"是什么驱使拿破仑坚持向莫斯科进军
"What drove Napoleon to keep marching toward Moscow?

赛斯怎么知道的
How did Seth learn this?

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,920
-杰姬的新闻主管  -是昨晚的事吗
- Jackie's comms director. - And this happened last night?

365
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,790
据我所知是这样
From what I can gather.

366
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,220
那怎么现在才告诉我
So why am I just hearing about it now?

367
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,520
之前怎么没人提醒我
I didn't hear about it before it happens.

368
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,080
她显然是不想让别人知道
Obviously, she was trying to keep it a secret.

369
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,880
但你不是盯着她呢吗
But you're supposed to be keeping tabs on her.

370
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,410
结果你不仅不知道  还得赛斯告诉你
The fact that you didn't know, and only found out from Seth--

371
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,370
我不在爱荷华  先生
I'm not in Iowa, sir.

372

我在华盛顿管理你的团队
I'm here running your staff.

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,450
你说什么
Excuse me?

374
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,100
尽管我和杰姬有一段过往
Just because Jackie and I have a personal history

375
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,510
不代表我知道她的一举一动
doesn't mean I know her every movement.

376
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,690
我们说的不是你的前女友
We are not talking about your ex-girlfriend.

377
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,650
我们说的是我的竞选伙伴
We're talking about my running mate.

378
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,060
如果我们不能信任她
And if she can't be trusted,

379
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,150
那她不想说的话我也没法逼她说
I can't force her to reveal things she doesn't want to.

380
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,380
当初就是你力主
You are the one who convinced me

381
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,890
我和她做交易的
to make the deal with her in the first place.

382
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,840
我们需要信息  她有门路搞到信息
We needed information. She had access.

383
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,210
结果现在她欺瞒我们
And now she's lying to us.

384
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,960
也许认定此事为危机之前  你该先和她谈一谈
Maybe you should speak with her before we consider this a crisis.

385
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,460
我不喜欢你的语气  雷米
I don't like your tone, Remy.

386
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,210
-你反应过度了  -你给我注意点
- You're blowing this out of proportion. - Watch yourself.

387
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,730
之前在国会  我为你工作时
When I worked for you in Congress,

388
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,100
你一向让我对你有话直说
you always told me to be straight up with you.

389
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,790
那时候我不是总统
I wasn't the president then.

390
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,030
那你是想让我低头道歉做应声虫了
So you just want me to apologize and be a yes-man?

391
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,810
我要你对总统放尊重些
I want you to treat this office with respect.

392
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,520
那你也该对你的手下尊重点
You owe your staff that same respect.

393
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,330
你当初走投无路的时候
I gave you a position in the White House

394
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,600
我收容你在白宫供职
when no one would touch you.

395
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,420
我什么都不欠你的
I don't owe you a damn thing.

396
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,690
你打算拿这个说事说多久
How long you gonna hang that over my head?

397
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,610
你简直像是想让我解雇你
Oh, it's like you want me to fire you.

398
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,130
你不能解雇我  你心里明白
You couldn't, and you know it.

399
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,270
至少现在不能
Not right now.

400
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,200
赛斯和我是你仅有的两个小兵
Seth and I are the only two soldiers you have.

401
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,060
-接通杰姬的电话  -遵命  先生
- Get Jackie on the phone. - Yes, sir.

402
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,620
先生  夏普议员的电话
Sir, Congresswoman Sharp calling for you.

403
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,020
我就在这里接
I'll take it in here.

404
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,960
先生  我们可以替您擦鞋的
Sir, we'll gladly polish those for you.

405
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,840
我乐意自己来  谢谢
I'm happy to do it myself. Thank you.

406
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,690
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

议员女士
Congresswoman.

408
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,640
抱歉您可能会听到咀嚼声
I apologize if you hear chewing.

409
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,500
这是我今天
This is the first chance

410
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,460
第一次有机会吃饭  日程太满了
I've gotten to eat all day. Non-stop events.

411
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,460
我很惊讶你在见过邓巴之后居然还有胃口
I'm surprised you have an appetite after meeting with Dunbar.

412
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,010
她的人要求见面  我同意了
Her people asked. I said yes.

413
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,700
我想在打扰您之前先看看她想要什么
I thought I'd see what she wanted before bothering you with it.

414
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,290
让你暂停竞选活动吗  你拒绝她了吧
Suspending your campaigns? I'm assuming that you told her no.

415
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,400
我同意了
I told her yes.

416
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,950
你明白她这是在
You realize she's just

417
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,330
利用你的善良来阻碍你筹款吧
preying upon your good nature to stop your fundraising.

418
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,570
即使是这样  这在政治上对我也有好处
Even if that were the case, the politics work in my favor too.

419
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,450
在这么大的灾难面前继续竞选是不应该的
It's insensitive to campaign during a catastrophe this big.

420
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,720
可能对我造成不良影响
It could backfire on me.

421
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,480
我们并不确定一定就会有大灾难发生
We don't know that it's going to be a catastrophe.

422
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,380
气象预报员可能会出错  总统先生
Weathermen can be wrong, Mr. President,

423
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,190
但全国每个预报员不会都错
but not every weatherman in the country.

424
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,370
好吧  即使成真
All right, even if that's true,

425
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,170
你也应该攻击她
you should attack her

426
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,130
借飓风给自己拉同情票
for using the hurricane to score sympathy points.

427
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,480
我已经和我手下讨论过了
I've discussed it with my staff.

428
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,860
这不只是你的竞选  杰姬
This isn't just your campaign, Jackie,

429
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,430
这是我们两个的竞选
this is our campaign.

430
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,330
我能给您点建议吗  先生
May I offer you some advice, sir?

431
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,620
签署那份法案吧
Sign the bill.

432
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,710
如果您不签  飓风真的来了
If you don't, and the storm hits,

433
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,530
我们就根本没得可竞选了
you and I won't have a campaign.

434
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,500
你还是好好吃你的晚饭吧
You should get back to your dinner.

435
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,120
大家先暂停一下
Hey, everyone. Let's put down the dishes for a second.

436
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,090
我需要和你们谈谈
I need to talk to you.

437
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,620
情况是这样
Here's the deal.

438
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,250
我因为《美国就业法案》才雇了你们三个
I hired you three under America Works.

439
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,480
虽然我们确实需要人手
And as much as we can use the manpower,

440
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,800
但如果法案中止  我负担不起这么多人
I can't afford it if the program gets ended.

441
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,240
如果你们轮班的话  我或许能负担得起两个
I might be able to afford to keep two of you if you split shifts,

442
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,700
但你们三个肯定不能都留下
but I can't keep all three.

443
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,610
"这场飓风已经酝酿了不只数周
"A storm has been forming not for weeks,

444
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,860
而是数十年
but for decades.

445
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,540
飓风的名字不是费斯  而是弗兰西斯
Its name is not Faith, it's Francis.

446
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,880
全国上下均在他的路径上
The entire nation is in his path,

447
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,600
而如果我们无视警钟
and if we ignore the warning signs,

448
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,020
就只能怪自己了"
we have no one but ourselves to blame."

449
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,580
这不是一篇报道  是一篇评论
It's not an article. It's an opinion piece.

450
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,340
我知道
I know.

451
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,550
报纸不能采取这个社论立场
The paper can't take this editorial stance.

452
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,950
-太多臆测了  -我知道
- It's too speculative. - I'm aware.

453
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,970
可以作为专栏发表
Print it as a column.

454
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,590
一旦我那样做  你就越界了
The moment I do that, you cross over to the other side.

455
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,330
我们就不能再让你做现在的工作了
We can't keep you on your beat.

456
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,660
那就换掉我
So replace me.

457
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,210
我想做专栏  是时候了
I want a column. It's time.

458
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,070
凯特  你现在可以一路升到总编辑
Kate, you're on track to be managing editor.

459
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,070
如果你变成一名专栏作家
You toss that out the window

460
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,020
大好前途就毁了
the moment you switch over to being a columnist.

461
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,970
我不想去编辑其他人的文字
I don't want to be editing other people's words.

462
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,140
我想写我自己的文字
I want to be writing my own.

463
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,470
而且不只是新闻  我希望能说出我的想法
And not just the news, I want my ideas out there.

464
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,270
你知道你想干什么《电讯报》都会同意
Look. You know the Telegraph will let you do anything you want.

465
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,700
但我们需要你报道总统
But we need you reporting on the President.

466
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,840
-没人比你干得好  -我的偏见很明显
- Nobody does it better. - My bias is clear.

467
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,050
你本来也不该再让我做报道了
You shouldn't keep me on as a reporter anyway.

468
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,510
这样吧  我们可以把这变成一篇分析文章
I'll tell you what. We can make this work as an analysis piece.

469
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,110
你砍掉一些推测成分  着重事实和引述
You tone down the speculation, stick to the facts and quotes--

470
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,070
-整篇文章重点就在于推测  -好吧
- Speculation is the entire point. - Fine.

471
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,740
至少...
Just...

472
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,600
给我一点另一方的立场  平衡一下
give me a little something from the other side, to balance it out.

473
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,170
你明知道他们不会对我说什么
You know they're not gonna give me a quote.

474
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,260
哪怕只是一个
Even if it's a source just

475
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,840
和政府有点擦边关联的信息源
tangentially associated with the administration.

476
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,430
你这样做了
You do that,

477
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,100
我们就能既发表文章又让你继续做记者
we can print this and keep you as a reporter.

478
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,210
我想到我能和谁谈了
I got an idea who I can talk to.

479
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,730
"也许换一天  水不那么冷
"On another day, with warmer water,

480
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,250
水流也给他助力
with the current carrying him,

481
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,770
他也许真能游到
he might have made it.

482
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,720
但这天
But on this day,

483
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,250
他游到一半时  胳膊再也挥不动了
he would only make it halfway before his arms gave out

484
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,000
麻木彻底击溃了他  随后他被海岸警卫队
and the numbness overtook him, before the coast guard

485
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,670
从水里救起  即便他非常不情愿
pulled him out of the water despite his protests.

486
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,730
他鲁莽吗  他傻吗
Was he reckless? Was he foolish?

487
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,650
可能吧
Possibly.

488
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,040
不过有一件事是不容否认的
One thing can't be denied, however.

489
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,690
其他人都认定不可能的  他却偏不相信
What others saw as impossible, he refused to believe as such.

490
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,570
河水证明他错了  他离对岸还很远
The water proved him wrong. He fell far short of the other shore.

491
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,920
但他还是尝试了
And yet he made the attempt.

492
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,990
而这  就是一切"
And that... is everything."

493
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,240
这只是序言
That's just the prologue.

494
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,380
你一次都没提《美国就业法案》
You don't mention America Works once.

495
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,450
我特意的
On purpose.

496
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,110
这本书不就是写就业法案的吗
That is what the book is supposed to be about, isn't it?

497
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,460
你不喜欢吗
You don't like it?

498
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,380
我喜欢  我只是觉得
I do like it. I just wonder if I...

499
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,810
也许我还不能理解你打算怎么写
Well, maybe I don't... understand what you're trying to do.

500
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,310
没人单纯在乎一个理念
Nobody cares about an idea.

501
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,030
人们也许会关注有理念的人
They might care about a man with an idea.

502
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,690
而我只关注人
I only care about the man.

503
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,900
整本书都会是这种风格  这种小品文
The whole book will be like this... these vignettes.

504
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,670
就像短篇小说集似的
Like a collection of short stories.

505
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,720
你提到《美就法》了吗
Do you mention AmWorks anywhere?

506
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,620
没有
Nope.

507
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,410
一次都没提过
Not once.

508
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,140
我确实希望这书与众不同
I did want the book to be different,

509
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,120
但我  只是觉得这样可能...
but I... It just seems that that might--

510
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,840
我觉得这可能是我这些年写得最好的东西了
I think it might be the best thing I've written in years.

511
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,610
当然也可能是彻头彻尾的垃圾
It could also be utter and complete shit.

512
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,350
但我看不出是好是坏  这一般是好兆头
But when I can't tell the difference, it's usually a good sign.

513
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,560
我只是希望不要偏离了大方向
I just don't want to lose sight of the bigger goal.

514
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,340
我只会这么写
I don't know any other way to write it.

515
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,840
如果这样不合你的意
If you want something different,

516
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,630
最好现在就换人
now's the time to find somebody else.

517
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,160
不  我希望你写完
No, I want you to finish it.

518
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,180
虽然我不知道
Even though I have...

519
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,950
如果我签了法案  你这书怎么写
no idea if it will end up being relevant if I end up...

520
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,140
还有什么要紧
signing this bill.

521
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,460
你打算签吗
Are you going to?

522
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,360
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

523
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,280
当然  就算我签了法案
If I do, of course,

524
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,300
你的书用不着了  我还是会付全额稿酬的
I'll pay you in full if the book becomes unnecessary.

525
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,170
我写这书不是为了钱
I'm not doing this for the paycheck.

526
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,570
你有什么看法
What do you think?

527
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,160
我该不该签
Should I sign it?

528
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,550
这牵涉到我的利益
Well, I have skin in the game.

529
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,270
所以出于私心  我希望你别签
So the selfish part of me says no.

530
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:53,990
不过
But...

531
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,900
老实说
honestly?

532
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,230
没有哪本书值得让人送命
No book is worth people losing their lives.

533
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,170
话是没错  但这不只关系到这本书
Yes, but it's not just about the book.

534
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,560
也是为了让人们重回工作岗位
It's about putting people back to work.

535
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,600
如果人都死了  还怎么工作呢
People can't work if they're dead.

536
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,970
我最近一段时间内
Well, I'm gonna obviously be very occupied

537
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,340
都会为这个飓风忙里忙外
by this hurricane for the foreseeable future.

538
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,310
再让我考虑考虑吧
Let me think on this for...

539
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,080
你最好别坑他
You'd better not fuck him over.

540
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,800
-什么  -你写的东西
- Excuse me? - With what you're writing.

541
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,810
我也没这个打算
I don't intend to.

542
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,550
-你在书里说他傻  -你偷听
- The part about being foolish? - You eavesdropping?

543
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,800
-他不傻  -我也没说他傻
- He's not foolish. - That wasn't my point.

544
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,730
我不会为个傻子挡子弹
I wouldn't take a bullet for a man who was.

545
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,990
走吧  你的车已经候着了
Let's go, your car's waiting.

546
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,290
从明天起
As of tomorrow,

547
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,730
夏普议员女士和我将暂停竞选活动
Congresswoman Sharp and I are suspending our campaigns.

548
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,000
我们将赶赴受飓风费斯影响的地区
We will be traveling to areas affected by Hurricane Faith,

549
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,610
整个竞选团队也将随行
along with our campaign staff,

550
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,580
以便为灾区贡献我们最大的力量
in order to volunteer in whatever capacity is most helpful.

551
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,430
我们也将暂停接受捐款
We're also suspending any donations,

552
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,360
同时呼吁我们的支持者向红十字会
and urge our supporters to donate to the Red Cross

553
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,500
和其他飓风援助机构捐款
and other hurricane relief agencies.

554
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,730
大灾当前  理应暂停政治活动
In times of suffering, it's important to suspend politics

555
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,920
做对国家有益之事
and do what's best for the country.

556
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,840
我们期待在飓风过去
We look forward to resuming our campaigns

557
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,160
东海岸人民安全之后
when the storm has cleared

558
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,280
重启竞选活动
and the people of the east coast are safe.

559
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,090
以上是民主党总统竞选候选人...
That was democratic precedencial candidate...

560
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,740
弗莱迪
Freddy?

561
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,470
总统想见你  海耶斯先生
The President would like to see you, Mr. Hayes.

562
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,090
我还有两小时才能下班
I still got two hours left on my shift.

563
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,820
没关系  弗莱迪  你可以走了
It's fine, Freddy. You can go.

564
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,300
我能带上我孙子吗
Do you mind if I bring my grandson?

565
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,340
因为飓风  日托所关了
Daycare got shut down 'cause of the storm.

566
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,150
当然可以  有车等着我们
Of course. We got a car waiting.

567
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,970
走吧  杜肖恩
Come on, DeShawn.

568
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,410
我们去见总统
We going to see the president.

569
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,950
弗莱迪
Freddy.

570
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,090
-很高兴见到你  弗兰克  -谢谢你能来
- It's good to see you, Frank. - Thank you for coming.

571
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,820
这就是杜肖恩吧  你好吗  先生
And this must be DeShawn. How are you, sir?

572
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,310
握手真是坚定有力
That is a firm handshake you have.

573
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,470
你想去那张桌子后面坐坐吗
Well, you want to go over and sit at the desk?

574
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,460
去吧
Go ahead.

575
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,170
有时候我也那么干
Yeah, I do that too, sometimes.

576
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,660
那桌子有一天或许会是你的
That desk might be yours one day.

577
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,280
你想当总统吗
Would you like to be the president?

578
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,570
想
Yeah.

579
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,380
要当总统  你得在学校取得好成绩
Well, to be president, you have to get good grades in school.

580
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,660
我看你带了作业来
Now, I see you brought some of your schoolwork with you.

581
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,040
我那边有个办公室
I have an office just around the corner in here,

582
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,980
你或许愿意去那里做作业
maybe you'd like to go do your work in there.

583
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,620
如果你想玩  我们还有游戏机
Or we also have a PlayStation if you'd rather play that.

584
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,790
-你有什么游戏  -很多呢
- What games you got? - Oh, we have plenty of games.

585
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,960
密查姆会带你去
Meechum will show you.

586
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,680
给你拿点什么喝
What can I get for you?

587
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,390
咖啡  苏打水  还是啤酒
Coffee, a soda, a beer?

588
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,520
-不用了  谢谢  -请坐
- No, I'm good, thank you. - Please sit down.

589
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,360
-你注册了《美就法》  -是的
- You signed up for America Works. - I did.

590
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,610
我有四万个你这样的案例
I've got 40,000 case studies just like yours.

591
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,250
我桌上还有一份法案
And I also have a bill on my desk

592
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,820
会斩断支持这四万人的资金
that's gonna cut the funding for all 40,000.

593
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,750
知道  我看新闻了
Yeah, I been following on the news.

594
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,460
我会签了它
I'm gonna sign it.

595
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,090
这场飓风危及太多生命了
There's too many lives at stake with this storm.

596
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,020
听起来那是正确的做法
Sounds like the right thing to do.

597
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,200
弗莱迪  你该有份工作
Freddy, you deserve a job,

598
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,450
而国会在强迫我剥夺它
and Congress is forcing me to take it away.

599
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,550
我跟我们的运营主管谈过
I've spoken to our head of operations,

600
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,960
如果你愿意  这里有份给你的工作
and if you want it, there's a job for you here.

601
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,250
-这不是施舍你  但...  -薪水多少
- Now, it's not charity, but-- - What's the pay?

602
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,790
我不知道具体数字
Well, I don't know the exact figures,

603
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,410
但我猜大概每月三千美金左右吧
but I figure somewhere around three grand a month.

604
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,260
-我知道不多  但...  -医保有吗
- I know that's not great, but I-- - Healthcare?

605
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,910
当然有  包括那个
Well, yes, of course. That's included.

606
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,600
-杜肖恩能用吗  -当然  所有家属都能用
- For DeShawn, too? - That's right. All dependents.

607
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,300
-什么工作  -厨房
- What's the job? - The kitchen.

608
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,920
帮厨师们备菜
Helping prep food for the chefs.

609
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,620
只要薪水在每月两千八以上
Well, as long as it's, you know, above 2,800 a month.

610
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,890
我需要那么多来付房租
That's what I need to make my rent

611
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,070
并保证杜肖恩什么都不缺
and make sure DeShawn has everything he needs.

612
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,350
我马上帮你联系主厨
I'll put you in touch with the head chef right away.

613
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,850
不知道...你还有其他工作吗
I was wondering... if you had anything else?

614
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,160
-除了厨房的  -我以为...
- Besides the kitchen. - Well, I just assumed that--

615
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,280
我一辈子都在厨房里工作
I've been working in kitchens my whole life.

616
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:23,910
我虽开过肋排馆不代表我喜欢厨房
Just 'cause I owned a rib joint don't mean I like working in 'em.

617
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,340
那你想做什么
Well, what would you rather do?

618
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,840
我看你们雇了园丁
You got groundskeepers out there.

619
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,270
车开进来时我看到他们在给树剪枝
I noticed 'em choppin' branches when we were driving in,

620
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,210
为飓风做准备
for the hurricane.

621
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,320
你喜欢那个
You'd prefer that?

622
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,510
一直都想在室外工作
Always wanted to work outside.

623
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,660
这肯定可以安排
Well, I'm sure that something can be arranged.

624
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,070
我也想哪天能当总统
I want to be president one day.

625
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,030
-那永远不可能  -但他说我可以
- Well, that's never gonna happen. - But he said I could be.

626
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,430
听着  孩子  他骗你的
Listen up, boy. He lied to you.

627
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,810
事实是  你永远不可能当上总统
The truth is, you ain't never gonna be president.

628
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,160
就像你海报里的那些篮球运动员
It's just like them basketball players you got posters of.

629
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,410
他们说你能做成任何事  当超级巨星
They say you can do anything, be a superstar, too.

630
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,740
但他们基因好  能长两米多  如果不是呢
But they were born to be seven feet tall and if they wasn't,

631
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,100
你说说他们还能有什么
tell me what would they have?

632
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,560
一无所有
Nothing.

633
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,270
他们中有一半连字都不识
Half of them can't even read a damn book.

634
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,190
孩子  这里不是你我能待的地方
No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.

635
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,930
有梦想是好事  别妄想就行
It's good to have dreams, just so long as they're not fantasies.

636
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,920
如果你被这套糊弄了  就只能怪自己了
You let anybody sell you that shit, it's your own damn fault.

637
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,820
-听见了吗  -听见了  爷爷
- You hear me? - Yeah, I hear you, Pop.

638
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,550
我立即送去国会
I'll get it to the House right away.

639
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,270
-能通知媒体吗  -可以
- Green light on the release? - Yes.

640
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,280
我不记得给过你我的号码
I don't remember giving you my phone number.

641
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,260
你是没给  你的出版商给了
You didn't. Your publisher did.

642
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,010
他想让我写本书
He wants me to write a book.

643
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,270
你没出过书我倒觉得意外
I'm surprised you never have.

644
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,920
我敢说不管你写什么都会卖得有我十倍好
I'm sure any book you wrote would do ten times what mine do.

645
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,420
肯定赶不上《天蝎》
Not as much as Scorpio.

646
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,410
比我之后的作品好
As any I've written since.

647
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,370
我上大学时看的
I read it in college.

648
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,280
改变你人生了吗
Did it change your life?

649
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,320
你是不是整天听人说这个
That's what you hear all day long, isn't it?

650
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,500
那得有人能在大街上认出我  不过没有
If I still got recognized on the street, which I don't.

651
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,700
主要是在签售会上
Mostly at book signings,

652
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,400
如果你写书  我建议你别开签售会
which I don't recommend if you write your book.

653
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,350
我请你来不是讨论我的书的
I didn't ask you here to discuss my book.

654
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,400
-不是吗  -我想谈谈你的书
- No? - I want to discuss yours.

655
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,870
我正在写一篇报道  如果没有白宫的评论
I'm working on a piece, and it won't go to print

656
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,000
我就没法刊登出去
unless I get a comment from the White House.

657
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,710
我不为白宫干活
I'm not a part of the White House.

658
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,670
不非得是原话
Doesn't even have to be a quote,

659
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,120
只要让我能改述一下就行  比如说
just something... that I can paraphrase, like,

660
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,020
"据与政府联系紧密  不愿透露姓名人士称"
"According to someone close to the administration..."

661
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,690
不非得公开
Doesn't have to be on the record.

662
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,250
我不会就我的书发表评论的
I'm not commenting on the book.

663
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,460
汤姆  你能知道别人无从得知的事
Tom, you got access no one else has.

664
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,430
有原因的  因为他知道我管得住嘴
For a reason. 'Cause he knows I won't talk.

665
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,020
尤其是对你
Especially to you.

666
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,500
我总可以请你喝一杯吧
Well, can I buy you a drink?

667
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,640
灌醉我可不好使
Getting me drunk won't work.

668
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,780
你大老远来见我  我欠你一杯酒
You came out to meet me here. I owe you one.

669
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,520
不如我请你喝一杯
Why don't I buy you a drink?

670
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,670
多来几杯怎么样
How about we have a few?

671
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,820
多几杯啊
A few.

672
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,060
行啊
I can live with that.

673
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,650
我真遗憾  弗兰西斯  我知道这有多难
I'm so sorry, Francis. I know how hard this is.

674
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,410
我也没办法啊  天气我管不了
It was out of my hands. I can't control the weather.

675
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,250
终究不好受
Still.

676
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,390
最让我不痛快的
What frustrates me more than anything

677
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,870
就是我们本来已经开始扭转局面了
is we were starting to turn the ship.

678
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,430
国会开始支持我了  再过几个月
I was getting support in Congress. A few more months...

679
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,480
领导层就将别无选择
and the leadership would've had no choice

680
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,370
只能支持《美国就业法案》
but to support America Works.

681
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,780
如果能让你好受些  凯茜刚刚打来电话
Well, if it's any solace, Cathy just called.

682
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,320
俄罗斯方面愿意出兵
The Russians are willing to contribute troops.

683
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,500
参加维和部队吗
To the peacekeeping force?

684
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,840
他们不想被落下
They don't want to be left out.

685
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,540
没开什么条件吗
No catch, no conditions?

686
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,540
没有  他们在联合国背负了巨大压力
None. There's too much pressure on them in the UN.

687
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,050
孤立策略起作用了
So the isolation worked.

688
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,160
他们派遣三百名士兵
They're sending 300 troops.

689
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,530
太好了
That's incredible.

690
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,890
-我们成功了  -不是我们  是你自己
- We did it. - Oh, no, not we. It was all you.

691
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,430
-一起吃晚饭吧  -我要睡觉了
- Join me for dinner? - I'm gonna turn in.

692
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,660
睡这么早
This early, huh?

693
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,310
等飓风刮过来  我三天都别想睡了
I'm gonna be up three straight days once this hurricane hits.

694
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,060
我得抓紧多睡会儿
I need to get all the sleep I can.

695
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,300
好主意  那你睡吧
That's a good idea. I'll leave you be.

696
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,060
等飓风登陆了  让管家通知我
Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.

697
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,020
弗兰西斯
Francis.

698
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,870
弗兰西斯
Francis?

699
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,570
登陆点在哪
Where did it make landfall?

700
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,550
-没登陆  -什么
- It didn't. - What?

701
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,070
飓风调头了
The hurricane turned.

702
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,590
现在朝东行进了  可能会到百慕大
It's due east now. It might hit Bermuda.

703
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,890
不过
But it'll, uh,

704
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,760
因为已经到了较冷海面  飓风会很快消散
dissipate quickly now that it's reaching colder water.

705
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,370
看来我们逃过一劫  总统先生
It looks like we dodged a bullet, Mr. President.

706
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,860
我的资金都来不及进行半吊子的应急准备
I barely got the money in time for a halfway decent response.

707
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,590
怎样才能撤回法案
How do we pull back on the bill?

708
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,550
已经送到国会并通知媒体了
Already delivered to Congress, we put out a release.

709
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,070
肯定有什么议事规则
There must be some parliamentary procedure

710
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,470
可以撤销我的签字
that will nullify my signature.

711
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,110
我已经咨询过白宫律师团
I checked with the White House counsel.

712
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,150
法案已经正式成为法律了
The bill is officially law

713
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,720
资金也已经拨出去了
and the money's already been appropriated.

714
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,330
联邦应急管理署正帮助数千疏散民众返回家中
FEMA is assisting thousands of evacuees returning to their homes.

715
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,800
除佐治亚州受飓风外围影响
With the exception of moderate flooding in Georgia

716
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,340
出现小规模洪水之外
due to rain from the outer bands,

717
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,160
东海岸其他地区基本上毫发无伤
the rest of the Eastern Seaboard was left virtually untouched

718
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,470
而大家原本预期这将是百年一遇的风灾
by the hurricane everyone expected to be the storm of the century.

719
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,860
飓风费斯造成的最大损失不是人员财产损失
The biggest casualty to Faith was not life or property, however,

720
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,440
而是安德伍德总统
but rather President Underwood's

721
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,850
饱受争议的美国就业计划
controversial America Works plan,

722
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,730
国会为应对飓风救灾
which Congress defunded in order to free up resources

723
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,820
已撤回了其资金
for storm-related disaster relief.

724
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,240
总统因受来自国会两党和媒体的巨大压力
The president himself signed the emergency appropriation into law

725
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,220
签署了这项紧急拨款法案
after facing immense pressure from both parties and the media.

726
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,980
看来你失业了
So you're out of a job, I guess.

727
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:30,270
可能吧  又不是第一次了 
Probably. Wouldn't be the first time.

728
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,080
不知道能不能让你好受些
If it makes you feel any better,

729
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,110
但是我的报道也彻底没戏了
there's no way my story'll get printed now.

730
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,840
为什么  因为我不愿意给你评论吗
Why? Because I wouldn't give you a quote?

731
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,490
不  整篇都是飓风比喻
No, it was a whole hurricane metaphor.

732
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,840
没有飓风的话  也没什么力度了
Kind of takes the wind out of the sails if there's no hurricane.

733
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,660
至少你性福了一把
at least you got laid.

734
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,960
没错  这么说还真诗意
Yep. That... that's poetic.

735
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,290
我是作家嘛
Yeah. I'm a writer.

736
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,090
-怎么了  -我得走了
- What is it? - I gotta go.

737
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,490
你这是想赶我走吗
Is that your way of getting rid of me?

738
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,320
不  是总统
No. It's the president.

739
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,510
我需要你把衬衫还给我
I'm gonna need the shirt back.

740
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,190
如果你叫我来是解雇我  那完全没必要
If you asked me over to let me go, it wasn't necessary.

741
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,760
-但我感激你的周到  -我没说要解雇你
- But I appreciate the thoughtfulness. - I'm not letting you go.

742
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,580
这本书现在更重要了
This book is more important now than ever.

743
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,040
但是  《美国就业法案》已经完了
But... America Works is done.

744
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,200
那就只剩一种办法使之重回正轨了
Well, there's only one way to get it back on track.

745
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,520
我要宣布参加2016年总统大选了
I'm announcing my candidacy for 2016.

746
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,300
我之前不能选
I couldn't run before.

747
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,060
我既没有竞选经费
I didn't have the money

748
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,660
也没有领导层的支持
and I didn't have the leadership's backing.

749
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,440
但我已经证明了《美就法》的前景
But now that I've proven what AmWorks can do,

750
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,790
我会得到经费和党内支持的
the money and the support will be there.

751
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,400
支持弗兰克·安德伍德就是支持《美国就业法案》
A vote for Frank Underwood is a vote for America Works.

752
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,850
-你说得对  -我说对什么了
- You were right. - How was I right?

753
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,640
过来看看窗外
Come over here, take a look out the window.

754
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,700
看见在那边忙活的那个人了吗
You see that man working over there?

755
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,070
-那是弗莱迪·海耶斯  -肋排哥
- That's Freddy Hayes. - The ribs guy?

756
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,010
-他现在是园丁了  -你真好心
- He's a groundskeeper now. - That's generous of you.

757
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,250
不  不是好心  是我的职责
No, it wasn't. It's my job.

758
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,150
你书里写我拒绝相信不可能
You wrote that I refuse to see the impossible as impossible.

759
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,740
弗莱迪只是一份工作
Freddy is one job.

760
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,900
我还有千万个要安排
I have ten million more to go.

761
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,800
那才是我的故事  那才是你说对的事
That's my story and that's why you were right.

762
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,090
你想继续写下去吗
So you wanna get back to work?

763
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,950
我想
I'm in.

764
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,870
现在就写吗  我没带笔记本
Now? I don't have my notebook.

765
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,430
这是我签署法案用的笔
The pen I signed the bill with.

766
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,400
好  开始吧
All right. Let's do it.

767
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,960
我从未企图游泳渡河去萨姆特堡
I never tried to swim to Fort Sumter.

768
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,200
托马斯可能知道是我编的  但他还是写了
Thomas probably knows I made it up, but he wrote about it anyway

769
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,460
因为他理解更重要的真理
because he understands the greater truth:

770
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,200
想象力也是一种勇气
imagination is its own form of courage.

771
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,360
我们再谈谈那次渡河的事
Let's talk more about that swim.

772
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,100
我的确只差这么一点就淹死了
I really did come this close to drowning.

774
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:45,200
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2005年  飓风卡特里娜扫过佛罗里达州后  经墨西哥湾在新奥尔良登陆
由于风力极强  登陆时给当地建筑交通用电等造成极大破坏
飓风登陆后  由于防水堤溃坝  导致水漫新奥尔良  进一步加重了灾情
时任总统的小布什乘专机赶到新奥尔良
当时白宫为了不影响救灾工作  小布什没有马上落地视察
但白宫发布小布什坐专机俯瞰灾区的照片后
却被媒体批为不体灾民疾苦  只在天上做做样子
此后小布什还在巡视联邦应急管理署时  对其署长的工作表示肯定
然而因为灾情严重  联邦应急管理署准备不足  救灾工作非常不得力
新奥尔良在飓风过之后很长时间都处于非常混乱的状态
所有这些灾后乱象都被媒体算在小布什的头上
认为是他指挥不力  不关心百姓疾苦
当时小布什已经因为中东战事进展不顺而倍受压力
卡特琳娜飓风在政治上给了他进一步的打击
此后他民望大跌  一直到他离开白宫  也没有恢复

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2012年总统选举进入最后阶段
一直落后的共和党候选人罗姆尼凭借在电视辩论中的出色表现后来居上
开始在民调中领先奥巴马
就在共和党希望可以趁热打铁领先冲刺的时候
大西洋上突然升起的飓风桑迪扑向美国东海岸
登陆后  新泽西  纽约和新英格兰地区停水停电停油
大量房屋被毁坏  灾情十分严重
桑迪登陆后  奥巴马一分钟也没有浪费这个领导救灾的好机会
以总统身份到灾区一线视察指挥
同受到桑迪影响的各州州长携手出现在电视镜头前
大灾当前  刚刚占据选举上风的罗姆尼不得不暂停自己的竞选活动
把电视头条让给领导指挥救灾工作的奥巴马
在选举前的关键时刻被奥巴马抢了风头
风过之后  大选选情彻底改变  民调结果开始不相上下
最终罗姆尼在选举中败给了奥巴马
