我可以跟你讲
I could tell you about

27
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,240
在电影院工作  送报纸什么的
working at a movie theater, some paper route.

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,480
蹬着自行车骑五里路
Riding my bicycle five miles

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,270
为了一个月十美金  给七家送报纸
to deliver seven papers for ten dollars a month, but...

30
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,900
但事实是  我没有自行车
the truth is, I didn't have a bicycle,

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,540
比起检票我更多时间是花在
and I spent more time sneaking into the movie theater

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,800
溜进放映厅看电影
than tearing tickets.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
那究竟是什么
So what was it, then?

34
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,720
我的第一份工作吗  那不能写进书里
My first job? Oh, that can't go in the book.

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,510
为什么不行
Why not?

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,440
我给一个在林子里种印度大麻的人打工
I worked for a man who grew cannabis in the back woods.

37
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,470
大麻贩子吗
A weed dealer?

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,230
不是  种地的  亨利叔叔
No, a farmer. Uncle Henry.

39
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,780
不是我亲叔叔  只是所有人都这么叫他
He wasn't my uncle, but that's just what everybody called him.

40
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,230
那你替亨利叔叔做什么
What did you do for Uncle Henry?

41
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,450
我装货
I packaged the product.

42
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,570
不知怎么他信任我做称重
For some reason, he trusted me with the scales.

43
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,870
那你  有没有揩油
And did you... partake of the product?

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,460
没有  老好人亨利叔叔
No. Good old Uncle Henry,

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,130
他用自己的化粪池给作物施肥
he fertilized his crop from his own septic tank.

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,410
但工作不错  我攒了不少钱
But it was a good job, though. I saved up a lot of money.

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,640
我在桑蒂诺四年的书费
It's how I bought all my books

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,880
就是这么攒下来的
my entire four years at The Sentinel.

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,780
跟我讲讲桑蒂诺
Tell me about The Sentinel.

50
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,660
你的第一份工作是什么
What was your first job?

51
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,640
别岔开话题  这书不是讲我的
No, no. Book's not about me.

52
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,310
《天蝎》里的男妓
The hustler in Scorpio.

53
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,220
那是你吧
That was you, wasn't it?

54
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,340
为什么这么觉得
What makes you think that?

55
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,610
作家不是都写自己熟悉的事吗
Don't writers write what they know?

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,400
男妓的原型是我的一个朋友
The hustler's based on a friend of mine.

57
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,520
我不接客
I didn't turn tricks.

58
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,020
只是在酒店大堂等着
I just... waited in the hotel lobbies

59
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,470
以防他惹上麻烦
in case he got into trouble.

60
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,880
挺艰苦的少年生活啊
Tough life for a teenager.

61
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,950
总比露宿街头好
Better than digging around in dumpsters.

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,620
他后来怎么样了  你的朋友
What happened to him? Your friend?

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,400
他死了
He died.

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,340
跟书里一样死于艾滋吗
Was it AIDS, like in the book?

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,280
自杀
Suicide.

66
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,040
书里怎么不这么写
Why didn't you write it that way?

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,210
因为那是小说
Because it was fiction.

68
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,510
因为自杀太自私
Because... suicide is too selfish.

69
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,420
稍后再聊
Let's talk later.

70
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,430
我有些事得跟克莱尔谈谈
I have a few things I gotta run over with Claire.

71
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,130
好的
Sure.

72
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,660
安排很紧
It's a tight schedule,

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,050
可能在回程之前都说不上话了
so we may not be able to speak until the flight back.

74
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,710
没事  第一次去莫斯科
No worries. First time in Moscow.

75
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,830
我还想去高尔基公园和天鹅湖呢
I've got a date with Gorky Park and Swan Lake.

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
进展如何
How's it going?

77
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,470
凯茜把声明发邮件给我了
Cathy emailed me the statement.

78
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,760
我们让克林姆林宫缓和了措辞
We got the Kremlin to tone down the language.

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,760
你觉得科里根会说吗
Do you think Corrigan will say it?

80
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,940
他肯定会恨里面每一个字  但如果能回家
I'm sure he'll hate every word, but if it means coming home...

81
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,080
佩特罗夫肯考虑这事的唯一原因
The only reason that Petrov is considering this is

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,170
就是我们在联合国有筹码
because we have leverage in the UN.

83
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,310
你们都确定这事没问题吗
You're both confident that this is rock solid?

84
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,220
要是佩特罗夫不配合  等我们一到美国  
If Petrov doesn't cooperate, the Secretary-General

85
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,850
联合国秘书长就会立即召开紧急会议
will call an emergency session the moment we land in the States.

86
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,170
但愿不用走这条路
Let's hope we don't have to play that card.

87
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,710
但不要让步太多
Just don't give too much away.

88
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,340
他这段时间在安理会受到排挤
Oh, listen, he's been marginalized in the Security Council,

89
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,850
他扣押了一名美国公民
he's detaining an American citizen,

90
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,150
他也想洗白
he wants to wash his hands of.

91
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,710
我相信我们这回能遇到一个比之前来访华盛顿
I think we'll find that we're dealing with a much more reasonable man

92
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,330
更通情达理的总统
than the one that visited Washington.

93
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,630
我们会带着维和协议和科里根一起回来
We fly back with a peacekeeping deal and Corrigan.

94
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,510
把困境变成美事
Lemons to lemonade.

95
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,910
回程的时候把我们的套间给科里根住吧
I think we should give Corrigan our suite on the way back,

96
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,020
别让媒体去打扰他
give him some privacy from the press.

97
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,360
可以  好主意
Yeah, that's a good idea.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,060
-你有睡过吗  -没有
- Have you slept at all? - No.

99
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,040
-吃过了吗  -还没
- Eaten anything? - Not yet.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,770
给
Here.

101
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,160
看这个
Come see this.

102
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,710
是不是这世上最摄人心魄的风景
Isn't it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,640
别发呆了  麦克斯
Earth to Max.

104
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,700
你好像有点心不在焉
You seem distracted.

105
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,340
是啊  可能有点
Yeah, maybe a little.

106
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,410
是因为凯拉吗
Is it Kara?

107
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,140
凯拉  什么啊
Kara? What?

108
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,590
你应该约她出去  她会答应的
You should ask her out. I know she'd say yes.

109
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,240
这对你有好处  结识新的人
It'd be good for you. Meet new people.

110
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,500
我不能  我还不信任自己
I can't. I don't trust myself yet.

111
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,570
这是什么意思
What do you mean?

112
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,430
麦克斯
Hey, Max.

113
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,450
说吧
Tell me.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,260
你保证不会看扁我
You promise you won't judge?

115
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,680
我不会的  我保证
I won't, I promise.

116
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,330
她离开我之后
Well, after she left,

117
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,070
有很长一段时间我沉迷于毒品和性
there were a lot of nights of drugs and women.

118
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,420
有些女人我根本都不记得
And some of the women, I don't even remember.

119
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,640
而凯拉是个好女孩  所以
And Kara's a nice girl, so...

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,120
但你已经洗心革面了
But you're not that person anymore.

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
之前有几次挺危险的
There were some dangerous situations.

122
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,650
情况很糟糕
It was all really fucked up

123
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,050
而且我没每次都采取保护措施
and I wasn't always safe.

124
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,480
你去检查过吗
Well, have you gotten tested?

125
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,430
没
No.

126
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,980
那你得去检查下
Well, then you need to be tested.

127
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,750
我知道  但我不敢去
I know, but it scares the shit out of me.

128
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,560
是啊  你想让我陪你去吗
Well, sure. Do you want me to go with you?

129
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,540
不  不用
No, I don't.

130
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,000
陶森市有家免费诊所
There's a free clinic in Towson.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,140
我好多朋友都去那儿看病
Plenty of my friends go there.

132
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,330
-你就直接过去  -知道了  知道了
- You just walk in... - I get it! I get it.

133
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,360
我明天可以陪你一起去  如果你想的话
I could go with you tomorrow if you want me to.

134
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,780
我不需要你教我怎么做
I don't need a mother.

135
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,000
我不是在对你说教
Hey, I'm not trying to mother you.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,380
我只是  我关心你  希望你平安
I just-- I care about you and I want you to be safe.

137
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,030
你就
Just--

138
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,140
麦克斯
Max.

139
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,220
麦克斯

140
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,460
非常感谢
Большое спасибо.

141
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,050
谢谢你释放科里根先生
Thank you for releasing Mr. Corrigan.

142
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,610
这对我们意义重大
It means a great deal to us.

143
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,590
对他的爱人肯定也意义重大
And I'm sure a great deal to his loved ones.

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,590
我们拥有相同的诉求  这只是个开始
We all want the same things. This is just a first step.

145
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,970
我的幕僚长利特斯基先生会护送你去监狱
Mr. Litsky, my Chief of Staff, will escort you to the facilities.

146
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,950
-请吧  -总统先生请
- Shall we? - Mr. President.

147
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,360
-谢谢  -你先请
- Thank you. - After you.

148
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,530
那我们重新开始
So... we start over.

149
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,570
就好像这是我们第一次见面
As though we meet for the first time.

150
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,720
请坐
Please.

151
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,990
-保证他会建一座监狱  -监狱
- Promise him a prison. - A prison?

152
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,860
一座新的联邦监狱
A brand new federal corrections facility.

153
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,670
他的选民为什么会希望选区里住进罪犯
Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?

154
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,450
他们不希望
They don't.

155
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,410
但他们希望选区里有更多工作
They do want jobs in their backyard.

156
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,220
多年来他一直在争取联邦政府的拨款
He's been trying to get federal funding for years.

157
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,710
博奇一直否决他的申请
Birch has fought him on it.

158
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,650
告诉他你能让博奇回心转意
Tell him you'll get Birch to come around.

159
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,560
如果这说服不了他
If that doesn't work,

160
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,610
暗示说有可能任命他为交通部长
hint there might be a place for him as Transportation Secretary.

161
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,650
他是汽车产业的代言人
He's owned by the auto industry.

162
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,680
他在二氧化碳排放问题上的立场简直气人
His stance on carbon emissions is deplorable.

163
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,980
那就用环保署署长的人选来制衡他
Then balance him out with whoever you have running the EPA.

164
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,220
现在就定下内阁人选我觉得为时过早
I am not ready to make cabinet commitments this early on.

165
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,930
这不是定下人选  你只是愿意考虑他
It's not a commitment. You're just open to considering him.

166
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,540
道格  得开始了
Doug? We should get started.

167
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,020
把汽车产业转化为你的优势
Use the auto industry to your advantage.

168
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,410
不论温考斯基支持谁
Whoever Winkowski supports,

169
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,440
福特和克莱斯勒的所有超级代表都会跟随他
every superdelegate backed by Ford and Chrysler follows.

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,790
如果这还没用
And if that doesn't work,

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,500
告诉他你交通部长的候选人里有迪克·巴特勒
tell him you're considering Dick Butler for Transportation.

172
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,710
他讨厌巴特勒
He hates Butler.

173
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,540
我得挂了  告诉我他的答复
I gotta go. Let me know what he says.

174
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,570
你来是为了锻炼身体  而不是工作
You're here to work on your body, not work on your work.

175
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,160
上司打来的
When the boss calls...

176
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,250
你现在由我负责  我说了算
Well, while you're on my turf, I'm the boss.

177
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,100
快进去躺到垫子上
Let's get in there and lie down on the mat.

178
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,600
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,540
-迈克尔  -安德伍德夫人
- Michael. - Mrs. Underwood.

180
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,630
叫我克莱尔就好
Claire.

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,190
他们对你好吗
You've been treated well?

182
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
很好  如您所见
Very well, as you can see.

183
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,050
谢谢  利特斯基先生
Thank you, Mr. Litsky,

184
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,150
但我想听科里根先生自己说
but I'd like to hear it from Mr. Corrigan.

185
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,610
是的  他们对我很好
Yes, they've treated me well.

186
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,310
-你看过医生吗  -昨天看过
- You've seen a doctor? - I have. Yesterday.

187
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,320
-你看起来很瘦  -我一直很瘦
- You look thin. - I've always been thin.

188
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,200
总统让我亲自过来
The president asked me to see you in person

189
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,630
告诉你这个好消息
to share the good news.

190
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,220
你的释放条款已经敲定了
The terms of your release have been finalized.

191
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,700
我们明天就带你回家
We'll be bringing you home with us tomorrow.

192
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,160
我以为你会高兴
I thought you'd be pleased.

193
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,830
条款是什么
What are the terms?

194
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,830
我们会举行联合新闻发布会
There will be a joint press conference.

195
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,390
-跟佩特罗夫吗  -是的  两位总统一起
- With Petrov? - Yes, both presidents.

196
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,290
协议要求你做一个简短声明
The agreement asks that you make a brief statement.

197
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,230
抱歉  字太小  我也没戴眼镜
I'm sorry, um, the type is too small and I don't have glasses.

198
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,920
-我们为科里根先生提供了眼镜  -是的
- We offered glasses to Mr. Corrigan-- - They did.

199
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,300
我的在被拘捕时弄坏了
Mine broke during the arrest.

200
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,560
其他犯人没有眼镜
The other inmates don't get glasses.

201
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,580
我不想受特殊待遇
I didn't want special treatment.

202
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,070
我们为所有需要的人提供眼镜  不论国际
We provide glasses to anyone who needs them, Russian or American.

203
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,630
这是个谎言
That is a lie.

204
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,460
我读给你听
I will read it.

205
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,630
上面写着  "我  迈克尔·科里根
It says, "I, Michael Corrigan,

206
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,410
就违反俄罗斯联邦法律
apologize to the citizens of the Russian Federation

207
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,950
向俄国公民道歉
for breaking your laws.

208
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,530
我不该向未成年人
I regret my part in exposing minors

209
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,820
宣扬非传统性取向
to nontraditional sexual attitudes.

210
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,240
我很感谢佩特罗夫总统
I am grateful to President Petrov

211
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,850
宽容地释放了我
for the clemency my release demonstrates,

212
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,840
并允许我回到美国"
and for allowing me to return to the United States."

213
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,230
谁写的
Who wrote it?

214
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,120
这是国务院
It's the result of extended negotiations

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,970
与俄罗斯外交部之间
between representatives of the State Department

216
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,370
深入谈判后的结果
and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

217
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,770
抱歉  我不能做这个声明
I'm sorry, I can't say it.

218
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,730
我知道情况很不理想  迈克尔
I know it's far from ideal, Michael.

219
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,820
除非废除法律  不然不可能理想
There is no ideal. Other than repealing the law.

220
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,980
能让我们单独待会儿吗
May we have a moment?

221
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,630
佩特罗夫总统让我陪着您
President Petrov asked me to remain with you.

222
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,730
我请你让我们单独待一会儿
And I'm asking you to give us a moment.

223
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,850
利特斯基先生  这间牢房被监听了吧
Mr. Litsky? I'm assuming this cell is bugged?

224
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,260
我对这里并不了解
I know nothing about the facilities.

225
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,080
-在哪里  -安德伍德夫人
- Where is it? - Mrs. Underwood.

226
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,930
科里根先生和我要想真正地单独谈话
If Mr. Corrigan and I are to speak privately,

227
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,050
我需要保证对话的私密性
I would like to be assured that it is truly private.

228
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,450
告诉我监听设备在哪里
Show me where the bug is.

229
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,560
进来
Подойти.

230
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,660
安德伍德夫人要求拆掉监听器
Госпожа Андервуд просила убрать микрофон.

231
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,060
如果可以的话  这就拆
Прямо сейчас, если можно.

232
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,750
谢谢
Thank you.

233
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,840
他们不可能废除法律
They're not going to repeal the law.

234
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,120
你必须发表声明才能被释放
The statement is a prerequisite for your release.

235
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,420
没有商量的余地了  迈克尔
There are no negotiations here, Michael.

236
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,110
谈判已经结束了
That part already happened.

237
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,760
其他27个人呢
What about the 27 others?

238
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,340
他们不是美国人
They're not American.

239
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,040
如果不释放他们  我也不该被释放
Well, if they're not gonna be released, neither should I.

240
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,060
对于他们我们无能为力
There's nothing we can do for them.

241
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,580
你是第一夫人  还是美国驻联合国大使
You're the First Lady, and the ambassador to the United Nations.

242
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,350
你却告诉我你无能为力
And you're telling me there's nothing you can do?

243
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,990
我不相信
I refuse to believe that.

244
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,200
迈克尔  争取到你的释放就已经很艰难了
Michael, it was hard enough to negotiate just for your release.

245
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,410
恐怕你得把我拖出去了
You'll have to drag me out of here

246
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,050
因为我不会做那个声明
because I'm not giving that statement.

247
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,220
这只是几句话
It's just words.

248
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,390
等一回到美国本土  你就可以否认这些话
Words you can disown the moment you're back on US soil.

249
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,230
佩特罗夫的反同法
Petrov's gay propaganda law?

250
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,280
那也只是言语
That's just words, too.

251
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,780
指挥与控制权的轮换
So, command and control rotation.

252
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,500
第一年之后每半年一次
Semi-annually, after the first year.

253
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,290
我们希望能立即轮换
We pushed for immediate rotation,

254
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,430
-可是以色列人...  -当然
- but the Israelis have-- - No, of course.

255
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,020
我们需要赢得他们的信任
We need to earn their trust.

256
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,320
但是  做出任何重大决定之前
But we would never make any major decisions

257
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,290
我们都会先跟你的上将商量
without consulting your generals first.

258
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,390
只要能保证透明性  保持沟通就好
As long as there is transparency and communication.

259
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,470
这正是整个项目的关键
Well, that's the key to this entire enterprise.

260
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,340
只要平安度过第一年
Then after the first year is fine and, uh...

261
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,930
驻军数量也合适
troop numbers look agreeable,

262
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,700
你能保证派来这个数目吗
are you sure you can procure this many on your end?

263
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,840
是的  我不需要通过国会
Yes. I don't need Congress for that.

264
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,000
的确  但资金怎么解决
No, but the funding.

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,500
与其他派驻一样从国防预算里拨
It comes out of the DOD budget like any regular deployment.

266
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,350
至于你方军队的基础设施建设和后勤
Now, infrastructure and logistical supplies for your troops,

267
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,670
这份支出可以算作辅助设施
well, we can add that expense as ancillary support.

268
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,570
我们能出点
We can pitch in.

269
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,500
不管你们能拿出多少我们当然都欢迎
Well, whatever you could spare would certainly be welcome.

270
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,550
不过还有一件我们都在考虑的事
But... that brings us to the elephant in the room.

271
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,850
导弹防御
Missile defense.

272
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,190
我能接受波兰那边的部分削减
Now, I can accept a partial scale-back in Poland.

273
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,620
这可以不公开
And it doesn't have to be... announced.

274
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,790
可我们得考虑捷克方面
But we need to consider the Czech Republic.

275
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,250
说说你的顾虑
Tell me your concerns.

276
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,460
我说了不要打断我们
Я просил нас не беспокоить.

277
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,820
你夫人很重视隐私啊
Your wife values privacy.

278
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,390
你说什么
Excuse me?

279
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,760
我们正谈导弹防御呢
We were talking missile defense.

280
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,390
怎么提起克莱尔了
Why did you bring up Claire?

281
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:15,010
她正与科里根密谈  没什么大不了的
She's... talking privately to Corrigan. It's no matter.

282
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,200
出什么问题了吗
Is there something wrong?

283
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,680
希望没有
I hope not.

284
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,050
回到导弹防御上来吧
Now, missile defense.

285
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,150
就是一份说给俄国媒体听的声明而已
A statement for the Russian media. That's all it is.

286
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,420
我问你
Let me ask you something.

287
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,660
你要是我的话  会读这份声明吗
Would you read that statement if you were me?

288
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,040
是的  我会读的
Yes, I would.

289
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,290
你会感谢一个说你对孩子有威胁的人
You'd thank a man who says you're dangerous to children?

290
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,480
不必出自真心  只需说出来
You don't have to mean it. You just have to say it.

291
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,120
我绝食抗议了六天
I went on a hunger strike for six days.

292
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,700
然后我停了下来
Then I stopped.

293
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,150
饥饿使我难以坚持
Too hungry. I couldn't go on.

294
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,840
跟我一起被捕的  有个叫塞尔盖的
One of the others that, uh, I was arrested with, Sergei,

295
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,570
他坚持了28天
hung in there for 28 days.

296
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,770
他们决定强迫他进食
They decided to force-feed him,

297
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,620
并终于同意他母亲看望他
and they finally agreed to let his mother visit.

298
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,800
可这都太晚了
Turns out it was too late, on both counts.

299
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,800
关于我的新闻铺天盖地
Lots of news stories about me.

300
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,500
却没有关于塞尔盖的
None about Sergei.

301
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,080
一个人就这么悄无声息地死了
A man dies and it's like nothing happened.

302
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,080
就因为他是俄国人
Because he's Russian.

303
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,830
我不能抛弃其他被捕的人
I can't abandon the others in here.

304
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,630
还有外面成千上万
Or the millions of people out there

305
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,250
被人说他们生来就有问题的人
who are told the way they are born is wrong.

306
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,850
但回家后你可以讲出塞尔盖的故事
But back home, you can share Sergei's story.

307
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,990
这对他或其他人无济于事
That doesn't do anything for him or the others.

308
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,300
如果有必要  我们会把你拖出去
We will drag you out if necessary.

309
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,110
在这事上你无力反抗
You don't have any power over that.

310
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,040
但是  我可以自主的
But the one thing I do have power over

311
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,920
是不发表这份声明
is not making that statement.

312
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
好吧
Okay.

313
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,640
那如果我让他们修改
What if I can get them to change the line

314
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,030
关于非传统性取向这句呢
about nontraditional sexual attitudes?

315
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,200
这才是最困扰你的部分  对吧
That's what bothers you most, right?

316
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,720
这不是文字游戏  要么做到底  要么不做
You can't parse this. It's all or nothing.

317
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,410
政治不是这么搞的
That's not how politics works.

318
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,430
但革命都是这样的
But it's how revolution works!

319
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,330
进展怎么样了
How are things going?

320
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,190
我能跟你说句话吗
May I speak with you for a moment?

321
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,160
如果达不成一致  那就算了  就这样
Что если не будет согласования. То и будет и пусть. Все.

322
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,970
-你有什么目的  -你指什么
- What are you up to? - What do you mean?

323
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,780
科里根
Corrigan.

324
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,880
告诉我发生什么了
Tell me what's wrong.

325
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,220
你就希望他拒绝  从而使我难堪
You wanted him to refuse. To embarrass me.

326
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,860
你夫人叫他拒绝发表声明
Your wife told him not to make the statement.

327
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,110
简直荒唐
That is ludicrous.

328
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,500
你是带着虚情假意而来
You came here with false intentions.

329
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,160
不  维克多  我们都料到他会很顽固
No. Viktor, we knew that he might be stubborn.

330
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,470
但此人毕竟信念坚定
But this is a man with strong beliefs.

331
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,180
这份声明对我意义重大
This statement is important to me.

332
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,940
克莱尔肯定正努力说服他发表声明
Well, if anything, Claire is trying to convince him to make it.

333
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,180
那为什么她要求把监听设备拿走
Then why did she ask for the surveillance audio to be removed?

334
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,380
我不知道
I don't know.

335
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,670
或许是想让他放松
Perhaps so he wouldn't feel on the spot.

336
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,480
但是  不用担心这些
But, look, I wouldn't worry about this just yet.

337
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,220
克莱尔很有说服力
Claire is very persuasive.

338
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,050
我把话说明白
Let me be very clear.

339
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,000
他不发表声明  任何协议都免谈
If there is no statement, there is no deal on any front.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,040
我们的协议  关于他的协议都取消
Not between us. Not for him.

341
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,440
他会接受审判  被定罪  被判决
He gets tried, convicted, sentenced.

342
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,430
我已经让利特斯基先生通知他们了
Now, I asked Mr. Litsky to inform them both.

343
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,080
我对我妻子信心十足
I have complete confidence in my wife.

344
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,860
维克多  你要清楚  这不是什么计划的一部分
And Viktor, you must know, this isn't part of any plan.

345
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,230
就这样
That's it.

346
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,190
这份声明没有讨价还价的余地
There's no flexibility with regard to the statement.

347
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,130
你不配合就得接受审判
You don't cooperate, you go to trial.

348
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,290
正好  他们不能阻止我在法庭上发声
Good. They can't keep me from speaking in court.

349
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,330
那你丈夫怎么办
What about your husband?

350
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,630
你和约翰谈过了
You've spoken to John?

351
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,110
我跟他说我们抱很大希望
I let him know we were hopeful.

352
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,820
他怎么样了
How is he?

353
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,310
他很担心你
He's worried about you.

354
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,840
他本想跟我们一起来
He wanted to come with us,

355
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,270
但这明显不可能
but that wasn't possible, for obvious reasons.

356
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,090
我保证见过你就给他打电话
I promised to call after I saw you.

357
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,390
我其实想让你在空军一号上亲自给他打电话
I was thinking... you'd call instead. From Air Force One.

358
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,450
他会明白的
He'll understand.

359
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,290
他很想你  迈克尔
He misses you, Michael.

360
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,890
我也想他  我想念很多东西
I miss him. I miss a lot of things.

361
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,930
我的父母  我的朋友们  我的狗
My parents. My friends. My dog.

362
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,440
牢房外的明媚阳光
More than two square feet of sunlight.

363
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,500
但这就是我们选择的生活
But it's the life we chose.

364
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,370
我们正是因此才走到一起的
It's what our bond is built on.

365
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,120
约翰在国内媒体上非常活跃
John has been very vocal back home.

366
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,990
一直在呼吁释放你
All he talks about is your release.

367
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,620
你在让他痛苦  而你没必要这样做
You're causing him pain. And you don't have to.

368
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,290
他当初也没必要与我结婚
And he didn't have to marry me.

369
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,580
-这话太自私了  -或许吧
- That's selfish. - Maybe.

370
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,390
但为了离开这间牢房就否认我信仰的一切
But so is contradicting everything I believe in

371
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,020
也同样自私
just to get out of this cell.

372
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,860
我认为你现在这样做更加自私
I think what you're doing is more selfish.

373
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,050
这是你的自尊心在作祟
It's about ego.

374
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,360
你想向自己证明一些事
Proving something to yourself.

375
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,790
被你留在家里的那个男人却因此而痛苦
And a man back home is hurting because of it.

376
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,770
约翰的意志很薄弱  换他在这里待几天
John is weak. He'd say the statement in a heartbeat

377
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,560
肯定会毫不犹豫地读那份声明
if he spent more than a few days in here,

378
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,600
这也正是我在这里而他不在的原因
which is why I'm here and he's not.

379
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,600
如果他认为我这是自私  那又如何
If he thinks I'm being selfish, so what?

380
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,320
随便他能不能接受
Either he accepts it or he doesn't.

381
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,630
这不正是婚姻的意义吗
Isn't that what marriage is about?

382
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,540
接受你配偶的自私
Accepting your partner's selfishness?

383
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,580
你最应该理解这一点吧
You of all people should understand.

384
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,460
你根本不了解婚姻
You know nothing about marriage.

385
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,680
你认为婚姻的意义是...自我牺牲吗
You think it's about... sacrifice?

386
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,940
我认为婚姻的意义是彼此尊重
I think it's about respect.

387
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,940
而你没有尊重他的痛苦
And you're not respecting his pain.

388
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,530
他的痛苦无关紧要
His pain doesn't matter.

389
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,430
你怎么能这么说
How can you say that?

390
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,210
因为我的痛苦也无关紧要
Because mine doesn't either.

391
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,430
你知道自绝食抗议以来
You know what I've been asking myself

392
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,850
我一直在问自己什么问题吗
ever since the hunger strike?

393
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,570
"我真的愿意为此去死吗"
Am I truly willing to die for this?

394
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,510
我不知道这个问题的答案
I don't know the answer to that question.

395
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,310
但至少有一件事能让我足够在乎
But at least I have something that I care enough about

396
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,040
以至于问得出这样的问题
to even ask the question.

397
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,230
你这样问过你自己吗
Have you asked that of yourself?

398
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,890
你愿意为何而死
What are you willing to die for?

399
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,960
您准备离开了吗  安德伍德夫人
Are you ready yet, Mrs. Underwood?

400
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,310
还没有
Not yet.

401
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,850
恕我问一下  还要多久
How much longer, if I might?

402
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,720
请通知总统先生
Please inform the President

403
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,800
科里根先生跟我走之前我是不会离开的
I won't be leaving until Mr. Corrigan comes with me.

404
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,460
您不能留在这里  安德伍德夫人
You can't stay here, Mrs. Underwood--

405
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,230
请转达我的话  好吗
Pass along the message, would you?

406
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,240
我们不能让第一夫人留在...
We can't have the First Lady staying--

407
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,140
你不能强行让我离开
You're not going to forcibly remove me.

408
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,100
所以请照我说的去做
So, please, do as I ask.

409
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,990
你在干什么  维克多都快气疯了
What are you doing? Viktor is beside himself.

410
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,550
你得说服他放弃那份声明
You need to convince him to let go of the statement.

411
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,500
你得考虑到可能有人在监听我们的谈话
Look, you have to assume we're being overheard.

412
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,040
这电话可不是保密线路
This is not a secure line.

413
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,110
我所说的话完全可以当着佩特罗夫的面说
Anything I'm saying, I'd say to Petrov himself if he were here.

414
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,070
我以为你在劝说科里根做声明呢
I thought you were convincing Corrigan to make the statement.

415
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,400
弗兰西斯  我在尽一切努力
Francis, I'm doing my best,

416
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,030
但我们必须两边一起努力
but we need to come at this from both sides.

417
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,760
他很固执
Well, he's adamant.

418
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,850
他不会让步  而且我也不怪他
He's not gonna back down and I don't blame him.

419
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,350
科里根也很固执
Corrigan's adamant, too.

420
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,530
整个协议都取决于这件事
The entire deal hinges on this.

421
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,640
维克多把他的要求说得很明确
Now, Viktor made it very clear what his needs are,

422
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,030
而且我们之前也保证过...
and we made promises before we--

423
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,330
我正在努力挽回局面
I'm trying to salvage the situation.

424
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,300
没多少时间了
There isn't much time.

425
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,040
我们定好了明天回到飞机上
We're scheduled to get back on the plane tomorrow

426
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,160
媒体都等着迈克尔也上飞机
and the press expects Michael to get on with us.

427
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,800
维克多  如果你正在听
Viktor, if you're listening to this,

428
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,920
请明白我一直在为你说话
please know I'm advocating on your behalf.

429
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,910
但你或许应该考虑放弃这份声明
But you might want to consider letting the statement go.

430
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,820
他不会那样做的  克莱尔
He's not gonna do it, Claire.

431
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,190
好好和他谈谈  弗兰西斯
Just talk to him, Francis.

432
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,010
如果他不愿放弃
If he won't let it go,

433
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,730
看能不能把语言再缓和一些
see if he'll tone it down some more.

434
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,270
他也不希望这一切功亏一篑
He doesn't want all of this to fall apart either.

435
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,550
好吧  我尽力试试
All right. I'll see what I can do.

436
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,760
有消息我会通知你的
I'll keep you posted.

437
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,230
这太好了  谢谢
Oh, this is great. Thank you.

438
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,910
能给我一张收据吗
If I could have a receipt...

439
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,370
-不好意思  -谢谢
- Oh. Excuse me. Sorry. - I appreciate it.

440
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,080
麦克斯
Hey, Max.

441
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,060
我在诊所
I'm here at the clinic.

442
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,840
你没事吧  你听起来...
Are you okay? You sound--

443
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,400
我好害怕  他们马上要抽血了
I'm scared. They're about to take the blood sample.

444
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,190
你能来吗
Can you come?

445
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,630
求你了  我真的好害怕  丽萨
Please, I'm really scared, Lisa.

446
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,710
好的  好的  我尽快赶过去  好吗
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

447
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,650
嗯  等着我
Yeah. Just hold tight.

448
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,760
我得离开  你能照看一下这里吗
Hey, um, I need to go. Do you mind taking care of all this?

449
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,710
好  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

450
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,180
好消息  奥尔西先生  你所有检测均呈阴性
Good news, Mr. Orsay. You're negative on all fronts.

451
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,790
这是检测结果  供您保留
There are the results, for your records.

452
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,990
这里还有一些小册子  关于保护措施
I've got some literature if you like, on protection,

453
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,000
防护举措  如何避免高危接触
preventative strategies, how to avoid high-risk encounters.

454
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,650
谢谢  不用了
No, thank you, I'm... I'm good.

455
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,740
那个  我还是拿着吧
Yeah, actually, I will take those.

456
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,460
是阳性
I'm positive.

457
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,590
我现在不想一个人待着
I just I can't-- I can't be alone right now.

458
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,280
跟我来  跟我来吧
Come with me. Come with me. Okay?

459
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,230
-斯坦普  -你真厉害
- Stamper. - You're good.

460
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,780
他答应了
He said yes?

461
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,420
耗了几小时  但他加入了
Took a couple of hours, but he's on board.

462
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,700
你提到巴特勒了吗
Did you have to bring up Butler?

463
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,270
-监狱就够了  -太好了
- The prison was enough. - Great.

464
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,400
接下来你要谁
Who's your next target?

465
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,780
威利斯·莫里森  12区
Willis Morrison, Twelfth District.

466
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,540
俄亥俄  他的资料在我家
Ohio. I have his file at home.

467
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,610
我一小时后打给你
I'll call you in an hour.

468
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,750
稀罕啊  你又在打电话
Surprise, surprise. You're on the phone again.

469
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,440
这是我自由时间  不归你管了
I'm on my time now, not yours.

470
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,380
你要走吗
You outta here?

471
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,930
嗯  你是我最后一个预约
Yeah, you were my last appointment.

472
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,510
今天的复健有什么用吗
Did that work today help?

473
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,370
嗯  我感觉很棒
It did. I feel great.

474
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,750
你的进步很大
Well, you're making great progress.

475
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,800
等你完全恢复了
And when you're fully recovered, you know,

476
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,120
我们会做手术把粘在你耳朵上的手机切除掉
we'll have that cell phone surgically removed from your ear.

477
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,530
回见了
See you later.

478
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,420
但我来说不是更有力吗
But isn't it even more powerful coming from me?

479
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,300
会很空洞  那些话必须他说
It would ring hollow. The words must come from him.

480
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,660
反正也没人会相信他是真心
But no one will believe he means them, anyway.

481
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,160
他是否真心无所谓
Whether he means them doesn't matter.

482
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,270
但如果他说了  就表明他尊重我们的法律
The fact that he says them shows respect for our laws.

483
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,310
我也希望他能发表声明
I wish he'd make the damn statement too,

484
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,930
他或许会的  但如果他不肯
and maybe he will. But if he doesn't,

485
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,480
你就愿让我们今天
you're willing to let all the work

486
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,470
达成的一切协议都付诸东流吗
we've accomplished today go down the drain

487
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,260
就因为一个大嘴巴抗议者
because of one loud-mouth protester

488
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,380
和一项你肯定也并不认同的法律吗
over a law you can't possibly believe in?

489
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,270
你说得对  我是不认同
No, you're right. I don't believe in it.

490
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,380
我两个内阁成员还是同性恋呢
Two of my cabinet ministers are gay.

491
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,550
我前妻的侄子也是
My ex-wife's nephew is gay,

492
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,940
那孩子我视如己出
the one who is basically like a son to me.

493
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,800
我个人根本不在乎
Personally, I don't care.

494
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,210
既然你不在乎
So if you don't care,

495
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,410
就让我们带他离开监狱  上飞机吧
let's haul him out and put him on the plane.

496
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,400
听我说  我也不希望我们的协议泡汤
Look, I don't want our deal to fall apart any more than you do.

497
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,270
你妻子在电话上说得对
Your wife was right on the phone.

498
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,760
但我要考虑的不仅是我们的协议
But there is more than just our deal for me to consider.

499
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,330
我得显示出力量
I need to show strength.

500
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,220
不会有人将此视为软弱
No one's going to see this as a weakness.

501
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,090
恰恰相反  你放他走只会受到赞誉
On the contrary, you'll be applauded for letting him go.

502
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,140
谁的赞誉  西方吗
By who? Hm? The West?

503
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,560
你根本不了解俄罗斯  总统先生
You don't understand Russia, Mr. President.

504
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,220
如果大家不喜欢你的工作表现
If people don't like the job you're doing,

505
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,430
他们就会把你赶下台
they vote you out of office.

506
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,030
如果他们不喜欢我的工作表现  他们会推翻塑像
If they don't like the job I'm doing, they topple statues.

507
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,550
流血争斗  天下大乱
Blood is spilled. Chaos takes over.

508
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,360
反同法是不是很无理  是的
Is the gay propaganda law barbaric? Yes.

509
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,540
当然了
Of course it is.

510
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,710
但宗教  传统
But religion, tradition,

511
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,680
对大部分国民  那深入骨髓
for most of my people, it's in their bones.

512
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,650
这项法律  是为他们而出台
This law was passed for them.

513
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,590
我得像你那样  代表人民的意愿
I have to represent my people the same way you do.

514
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,280
如果科里根不为自己的行为付出代价
And if there is no cost to Corrigan's actions,

515
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,310
很多人会感到遭背叛
many of my people will feel betrayed.

516
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,630
不会因为你放了一个人  就引发革命
There won't be a revolution because you freed one man.

517
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,150
革命是一点点  一步步兴起的
Revolution sneaks up on you, one small step at a time.

518
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,770
我不能冒险  即使是很微小的一步
I don't take chances, even with the smallest of steps.

519
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,170
第一夫人一到  全员出动啊
No stone left unturned when the First Lady's in town.

520
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,070
能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

521
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,120
能把盐递给我吗
If you pass the salt.

522
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,100
你是如何变成今天这样的
How did Michael Corrigan become Michael Corrigan?

523
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,220
-同性恋吗  -活动家
- Gay? - An activist.

524
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,900
联调局一定给你介绍情况了吧
I'm sure you got a briefing from the FBI.

525
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,600
是的  但我想听你说
Yes, but I would like to hear it from you.

526
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,180
早在90年代初期  我一个朋友
A friend of mine, and this is in the early '90s,

527
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,260
她请我去参加一个社区集会
she invited me to go with her to a community organizing meeting.

528
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,580
我闲来无事  就去了
I had nothing better to do, so I said okay.

529
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,480
我们去了  屋里至多就12个人吧
We get there and there's maybe 12 people in the room, tops.

530
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,820
那场面真的很可怜
It was pretty sad, actually.

531
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,200
而演讲人的讲话主题是垃圾
And the guy speaking is talking about garbage.

532
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,920
-垃圾  -废物回收
- Garbage? - Recycling.

533
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,270
这家伙让所有12人都昏昏欲睡
And the guy is putting all 12 of us to sleep.

534
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,600
他说的话确实有道理  但毫无号召力
What he was saying made sense, but... zero charisma.

535
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,860
甚至可以说是排斥力
It was worse: anti-charisma.

536
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,380
但我注意到他有一个习惯
But I noticed he had this habit of, uh...

537
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,110
当他说到重点时会歪头
tilting his head when he was making an important point.

538
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,620
真的很惹人爱
It was... it was so endearing.

539
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,930
就像这样
It was like this.

540
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,470
像这样
Like...

541
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,260
我无法控制自己  当场就爱上了他
I couldn't help it. I fell in love with him right then and there.

542
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,350
演讲人是约翰
This was John?

543
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,470
真是恍如隔世
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.

544
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,690
电视上的他挺有号召力的
Well, he's pretty charismatic on TV.

545
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,620
他学会了如何号召别人  我学会了如何思考
He learned charisma. I learned how to think.

546
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,200
我们互相磨合得不错
We rubbed off on each other well.

547
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,960
我不知道你们在一起这么久了
I didn't know you'd been together so long.

548
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,610
21年
Twenty-one years.

549
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,580
只结婚了五年  因为之前我们没法结
Only been married for five because, well, we couldn't earlier.

550
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,270
弗兰西斯和我刚庆祝完28周年结婚纪念日
Francis and I just celebrated 28.

551
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,300
超过你半辈子了
Over half your life.

552
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,490
没错  我还从未这么想过
That's true. I haven't even thought about that.

553
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,730
你结婚时还很年轻
You were young.

554
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,370
22岁
Twenty-two.

555
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,830
你后悔过吗
You ever regret it?

556
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,740
不  不后悔  我爱弗兰西斯
No. No. I love Francis.

557
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,720
如今更甚以往
Now more than ever.

558
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,260
我后悔了
I regret it.

559
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,590
在还未完全了解自己之前就与人定下终身
Committing to someone before I even knew who I was.

560
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,970
我们并未进行合法宣誓
We didn't take legal vows,

561
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,170
但我们有自己的方式
but we had our own version.

562
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,470
-真的很傻  -为什么
- Stupid. - Why?

563
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,500
因为我给他的就只有伤害
Because all I've ever done is hurt him.

564
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,990
让他待在我背后  劈腿  各种各样
Um, kept him in my shadow, cheated on him, you name it.

565
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,620
两人相濡以沫的岁月最重要
Well, it's the history that counts,

566
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,280
而非其他事情  对吧
not the other things, right?

567
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,840
没错  过去无可替代
That's true. No substitute for history.

568
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,490
但对他不公平
But it's unfair to him.

569
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,980
我不相信公平
I don't believe in fairness.

570
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,910
我认为你也不相信  即便你在为之奋斗
I don't think you do either, even though you fight for it.

571
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,540
我不相信你对你丈夫的爱更甚以往
And I don't believe you love your husband more than ever.

572
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,280
你怎么知道
How could you possibly know?

573
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,570
将心比心
Takes one to know one.

574
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,870
约翰和我已经两年没上过床了
John and I haven't slept with each other in almost two years.

575
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,690
我们甚至都分房睡了
We don't even sleep in the same bedroom.

576
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,780
我们谈过分居的事  但终究没那么做
We've talked about separating, but we never follow through.

577
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,490
为了婚姻平等努力至今  我们自己却离婚了
It seems wrong to fight this hard for marriage equality

578
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,100
感觉不太好
and then get divorced.

579
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,780
于事业无益
Bad for business.

580
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,600
说实话  我认为这违背人性
Honestly, I don't think it's how humans are built.

581
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,020
在一起五十年  白头偕老
To be with each other for 50 years.

582
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,900
你也没得选  对吧
You don't have that option either, do you?

583
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,700
什么意思
How do you mean?

584
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,500
如果你不想继续下去
Well, if you wanted something else,

585
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,880
对你们的事业会是致命打击
that would be really bad for business.

586
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,660
你得吃点东西
You should eat.

587
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,820
蛇对夏娃也这么说
Said the snake to Eve.

588
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,720
吃你的苹果吧  世界不会就此终结
Eat your apple. The world won't end.

589
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,100
你得给你夫人打电话让她离开
You need to get on the phone and tell her to leave.

590
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,980
即便我打了她也不会听
She wouldn't listen to me even if I did.

591
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,710
她现在一门心思要为你说服这家伙
She's dead set on convincing this guy for your benefit.

592
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,470
必要的话  我会让保安护送她出来
I'll have the guards escort her out if necessary.

593
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,400
他们休想动我夫人一根手指
They will not lay a finger on my wife.

594
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,920
你其实更希望如此吧
You'd actually prefer that, wouldn't you?

595
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,770
这样你就能告诉全世界
So you could tell the world

596
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,980
我们拉着第一夫人的头发  把她拽了出来
we dragged the First Lady out by her hair.

597
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,650
我实在是越来越难以忍受你的多疑
I'm finding it more and more difficult to tolerate your paranoia.

598
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,810
我对你的谎言也一样
I could say the same of your lies.

599
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,640
我撒谎时  你绝不会发现
When I lie to you, you'll never know it,

600
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,510
而且肯定是有个好理由
and it will be for a good reason.

601
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,030
科里根可不算
Corrigan doesn't fall into that category.

602
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,620
我就不该邀请你来访问
I should never have invited you here.

603
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,410
你我可以协作  今天下午就是证明
You and I can work together. This afternoon is proof.

604
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,590
我就应该坚守我的立场
I would've been better off holding my ground.

605
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,500
然后逼我们通过决议案吗
And forcing us to pass the resolution?

606
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,050
联合国  我才不把他们放在心上
The United Nations? They mean nothing to me.

607
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,190
如果真是这样  你就会坚守立场了
If they meant nothing to you, you would have held your ground.

608
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,810
但你希望在国外和在国内一样受到尊敬
But you want to be respected abroad as much as you are at home.

609
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,420
而我是怀着敬意而来  维克多
And I came here out of respect, Viktor.

610
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,620
我对你的处境感同身受
And I sympathize with the situation you're in.

611
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,700
我们都深陷其中
That we're both in.

612
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,690
不要让迈克尔·科里根
Let's not let Michael Corrigan

613
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:00,160
决定国际形势的走向
dictate the course of nations.

614
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,600
我们至少讨论下
Can we at least discuss

615
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,770
如果由我发言应该怎么说
what a statement from me might look like?

616
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,750
你看上去精疲力竭
You look exhausted.

617
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,230
我在飞机上没怎么睡
I didn't sleep much on the plane, so...

618
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,190
你回去吧
You should go back.

619
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,630
你没必要跟我一起待在这里
There's no reason for you to be in here with me.

620
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,510
我不会走的
I'm not leaving.

621
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,800
你比我还固执呢
You're more stubborn than I am.

622
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,630
你为什么不让我帮你呢
Why won't you let me help you?

623
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,460
我的要求很明确
I've made my demands clear.

624
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,080
迈克尔  我告诉你如果你不肯
Michael, let me tell you what's going to happen

625
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,240
发表声明会发生什么吧
if you refuse to make this statement.

626
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,920
你谁都帮不了
You'll help no one.

627
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,810
事实上  其他那些跟你
In fact, life will get worse

628
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,780
一起被捕的人会陷入更糟的境地
for the others you were arrested with.

629
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,510
佩特罗夫会感到丢脸  会逮捕更多人
Petrov will feel embarrassed. He will arrest more people.

630
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,330
会通过更可怕的法律
He will pass worse laws.

631
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,670
他不会让一个美国的同性恋左右他的政策
He's not going to let some American homosexual dictate his policy.

632
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,300
此人十分无情
This man is ruthless.

633
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,150
你以为如果这事不成
You think he's gonna become reasonable suddenly

634
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,330
他就会突然讲理了吗
when all of this falls apart?

635
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,750
你太天真了
You're being naive!

636
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,710
而且你还让别人为你的天真付出代价
And you're letting other people suffer because of it.

637
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,190
别毁掉你一直以来的努力
Don't undo what you've fought so hard for.

638
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,990
你以为你能激我同意吗  你做不到
You think you can shame me. But you can't.

639
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,180
我是在告诉你实话
I'm giving you the truth.

640
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,880
我不管你对此有什么感受
I don't care how that makes you feel.

641
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,250
但帮自己个忙  听进去我的话
But do yourself the favor of hearing what I said.

642
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,270
-我听到了  -希望如此
- I heard you. - I hope so.

643
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,190
我不能背叛自己  那我成什么了
I can't betray myself. What would I be then?

644
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,370
政客  你本就是政客
You'd be a politician. And that's what you are.

645
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,490
让其他人去吼叫呐喊吧
Let the others do all the yelling and screaming.

646
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,570
你想要改变  就得学会妥协
You want change? Then learn how to compromise.

647
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,070
成熟一点  迈克尔
Be a fucking adult about this, Michael.

648
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,540
我得想想  好吗  我需要时间
I need to think. Okay? I need time.

649
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,190
飞机明天就起飞了
The plane leaves tomorrow.

650
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,940
你回去吧  我需要时间独自想想
You should go back. I need time to think alone.

651
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,930
-清空思绪  -你不走  我也不走
- Clear my head. - I'm not leaving here without you.

652
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,250
我需要时间
I need time!

653
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,740
你躺一会儿吧
Just... lie down for a little bit.

654
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,750
休息一下
Just get some rest.

655
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
-我不想再跟你争了  -好吧
- I just can't talk anymore. - Okay.

656
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,180
我躺会儿
Okay, I will.

657
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,210
就一会儿
For a few minutes.

658
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,750
谢谢
Thanks.

659
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,220
这病现在可以治的
There's treatment now.

660
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,680
最让我生气的
The thing that angers me the most

661
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,240
是我让她这么对我
is that I let her do this to me.

662
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,280
你对你前任也是这个感觉吗
Did you feel that way about your ex?

663
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,940
那痛苦能把你吞噬
The pain that just consumes you?

664
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,660
有一阵吧
For a while, yeah.

665
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,670
心情不好时还能感觉到
Still, on bad days.

666
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,910
她什么样
What was she like?

667
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,450
抱歉  你不非得...
Sorry, you don't have to...

668
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,730
没事  我不介意
No, I don't mind.

669
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,570
她...
She was...

670
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,570
她以前挺不容易
She'd had a tough life.

671
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,610
有很多负担  我之前也是
She had a lot of baggage. Which I did, too.

672
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,420
我们起初只是朋友  后来搬到一起住
We started out as friends and then we moved in together.

673
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,510
然后就发生了
And then it just happened.

674
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,230
我们相爱了
We fell in love.

675
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,720
我说不清
And I don't know, I guess...

676
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,660
跟她在一起  我觉得自己更强大了
I felt stronger with her.

677
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,490
我觉得她也有这种感觉
And I think she felt the same way.

678
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,170
或许是我天真
And I guess maybe it was naive,

679
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,760
但我以为我们携手前进  可以放下那些过去
but I thought that together, we could let go of all that baggage.

680
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,290
就一起做我们自己
Then we'd just be us.

681
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,720
那她为什么离开了
Well, why did she leave?

682
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,940
她说这一切太快了
She said everything was happening too quickly.

683
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,250
你之后再联络过她吗
Have you spoken to her... since?

684
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,690
没有  她再也不去团契了
Nope. She stopped coming to the fellowship.

685
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,190
我去过她公寓一次
I stopped by her apartment once,

686
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,220
房东说她走了
her landlord said she was gone.

687
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,510
你完全不知道她在哪吗
Just no idea where she is?

688
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,580
我们以前会躺在床上  幻想如果有选择
We used to lie in bed and fantasize about where we'd go

689
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:59,220
我们会去哪  巴黎  澳大利亚  廷巴克图
if we could go anywhere. Paris, Australia, Timbuktu.

690
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,910
瑞秋就这样  渴望远走高飞  我并不需要
That was Rachel, the far-off places. I didn't need that.

691
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,360
你想去哪
Where would you go?

692
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,220
希门尼斯山路
The Jimenez Trail.

693
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,170
在哪啊
Where is that?

694
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:22,850
新墨西哥州
New Mexico.

695
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,710
穿过整个州
Cuts across the whole state.

696
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,550
一路上有温泉  瀑布
It's got hot springs and waterfalls.

697
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,770
我们以前曾说要去  徒步
We used to say we'd go there, hike it,

698
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,950
找个好地方  建个小屋
find a good spot, build a cabin.

699
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,700
抱歉  不该净说我的事
I'm sorry, we shouldn't be talking about me.

700
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:46,890
是我问的
I asked.

701
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,420
茶闻着挺香
That tea smells good.

702
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,530
我也来杯好了
I think I'll have some, too.

703
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,770
可以
This looks good.

704
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,920
-每字每句吗  -当然
- You say every word. - Of course.

705
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,800
然后直接带他上飞机
And then you take him directly to the plane.

706
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,680
维克多  谢谢你
Viktor... thank you.

707
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,110
但是捷克共和国
But the Czech Republic,

708
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,240
所有导弹都要撤走  不光是部分撤离
I want all the missiles gone, not just a scale-back.

709
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,770
波兰可以留点做个样子  但仅此而已
You can keep something in Poland for show, but that's it.

710
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,760
同意
Agreed.

711
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,520
我们达成协议了吗
So, we have a deal?

712
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,970
包括我们讨论过的所有关于约旦河谷的事项
Including everything we discussed about the Jordan Valley.

713
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,250
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

714
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,220
那我们达成协议了
Then we have a deal.

715
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,660
天哪
Господи.

716
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,860
立刻把她带出去
Надо ее отсуда выводить.

717
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,360
快把他放下来  快  快
Спусти его скромно. Пошли, пошли!

718
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,320
走吧  安德伍德夫人
Come, Mrs. Underwood.

719
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,460
走吧  您不该待在这儿
Please. You shouldn't be here.

720
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,630
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood.

721
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,240
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,870
你想先休息下吗  换身衣服
Would you like to lie down for a bit? Change your clothes?

723
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,450
不  我上飞机再换吧
No, I can do that on the plane.

724
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,430
你直接去吧
Well, you go straight there.

725
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,450
我们还有新闻发布会要开
We have the press conference to do.

726
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,050
我该跟你一起  弗兰西斯
I should be with you, Francis.

727
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,720
我们能处理
We have that handled.

728
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,510
我想说点什么  抚慰他的家人
I'd like to say something. A few warm words to his family.

729
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,360
好的  当然可以
Yes. Yes, of course.

730
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,930
我也会表示惋惜  然后
I'll echo your sympathy and then...

731
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,590
然后说我今天本打算释放他
then say that I was planning on releasing him today.

732
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,490
我会感谢你的...大度
I'll thank you for your... your generosity.

733
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,090
整件事真是悲剧
How tragic this has been.

734
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,400
再提下约旦河谷
And then a few words about the Jordan Valley,

735
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,080
或者你想来宣布我们的协议吗
or if you'd prefer to announce our agreement.

736
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,760
不用  你说就行
No, no, it's fine if you do.

737
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
你介意让你手下
Would you... mind if your people

738
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,380
给我一份你声明的简稿吗
showed me a draft of your remarks?

739
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,570
当然  我马上让他们开始起草
Yes, I'll have them draft something right now.

740
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,640
你呢  安德伍德夫人
And yours, too, Mrs. Underwood?

741
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,660
好的  听你的
Yes. It's fine. Whatever you want.

742
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,510
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

743
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,410
早上好
Good morning.

744
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,800
安德伍德夫人想先简单说几句
Mrs. Underwood would like to start by saying a few words.

745
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,130
如你们所知  迈克尔·科里根今天早上
As you all know, Michael Corrigan was found dead

746
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,060
被发现死在自己的牢房里
in his cell this morning.

747
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,740
他上吊自杀了
He had hung himself.

748
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,390
迈克尔和我昨天简单谈了一下
Michael and I spoke briefly yesterday.

749
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,500
他一直得到善待  也很感激佩特罗夫总统
He was being treated well and was grateful to President Petrov

750
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,250
即将批准释放他
for granting his imminent release.

751
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,800
我们不知道迈克尔自杀的原因
We don't know why... Michael chose to do what he did.

752
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,350
我们本都满心希望迈克尔今天能回家
We all wanted nothing more than for Michael to come home today

753
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,560
我们向他的家人和亲友
and we offer our heartfelt condolences

754
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,620
致以最衷心的哀悼
to his family and his loved ones.

755
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:02,980
谢谢
Thank you.

756
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,300
谢谢你  安德伍德夫人
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.

757
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,720
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood?

758
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,650
我不单是昨天跟他谈过话
I didn't just speak to him yesterday,

759
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,280
事情发生时我也在场  睡着了
I was there when it happened, asleep.

760
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,420
他是用我的围巾上吊的
He hung himself with my scarf.

761
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,390
我知道迈克尔为什么决定结束自己的生命
I do know why Michael decided to take his own life:

762
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,450
因为他不想说谎
because he didn't want to lie.

763
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,360
我现在不能再用谎言玷污他
And I can't dishonor him by telling a lie now.

764
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,100
克莱尔
Claire...

765
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,060
我本想劝说他  让他承认他违了法
I was trying to convince him to say that he broke the law,

766
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,930
让他感谢佩特罗夫总统
to thank President Petrov.

767
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,770
但他拒绝了  因为他拒绝离开那里
But he refused, because he didn't want to leave

768
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,380
除非法律被废除
until the law was repealed.

769
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,020
除非那些因同样罪名被捕的俄罗斯人
Until the Russians who were arrested for the same crime

770
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,380
也得到释放
were also released.

771
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,090
迈克尔愿意为他的信念而死
Michael was willing to die for what he believed in.

772
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,180
-谢谢  安德伍德夫人  -他很勇敢
- Thank you, Mrs. Underwood. - He was brave.

773
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,280
-他的声音理应被听到  -够了
- And his voice deserves to be heard. - That's enough.

774
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,970
如果不是因为这不公的法律
If it weren't for this unjust law,

775
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,880
还有你们政府的无知  狭隘
and ignorance and intolerance of your government,

776
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,630
迈克尔也不会离开我们
Michael would still be with us.

777
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,480
你真可耻  总统先生
Shame on you, Mr. President.

778
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,450
我妻子过去这一天
My wife has been under a...

779
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,970
一直压力很大
great amount of stress these past 24 hours.

780
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,840
她显然还余惊未消
She's clearly in shock.

781
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,520
我向佩特罗夫总统和俄国人民道歉
My apologies to President Petrov and to the Russian people.

782
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,360
恕我失陪  我得去陪我妻子
If you'll excuse me, I need to be with her now.

783
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,600
-克莱尔  -别  弗兰西斯
- Claire. - Don't, Francis.

784
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,540
我必须跟他说话
It's imperative that I speak to him.

785
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,080
继续打  凯茜
Well, keep trying, Cathy.

786
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,880
如果佩特罗夫不接我电话
If Petrov won't get on the phone with me,

787
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,280
那我就跟布加耶夫谈
then I'll speak to Bugayev.

788
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,320
那就任何愿意跟我通话的人
Whoever will get on the phone with me, then.

789
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,700
好  谢谢
All right. Thank you.

790
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:57,790
您的咖啡  先生
Your coffee, sir.

791
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,490
谢谢  本
Thank you, Ben.

792
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:21,350
-总统先生  -待会儿的
- Mr. President. - Later.

793
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,260
我刚跟凯茜通完话  协议取消了
I just got off the phone with Cathy. The deal's off.

794
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,490
我们谈好的一切都推翻了
Everything we negotiated.

795
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,620
我们得讨论下一步
We have to discuss the next move.

796
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,730
我知道我做了什么  看起来是很冲动  
I know what I did. It seemed impulsive,

797
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,310
-但并不是...  -事已至此  我们继续吧
- but it wasn't-- - It happened. Let's move on.

798
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:40,640
如果你想说什么  弗兰西斯
If you have something you would like to say, Francis...

799
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,900
我只想尽量减少损害
I just want to minimize the damage.

800
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,010
如果佩特罗夫不肯回头
If Petrov won't come around,

801
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,350
我们就得推进联合国的决议案了
we have to move forward with the resolution at the UN.

802
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,100
我们已经准备好了
We're prepared for that.

803
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,070
很好  谢谢  尽量睡会儿吧
Good. Thank you. Try to get some sleep.

804
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,650
你不是该在后面跟媒体在一起吗
Shouldn't you be in the back, with the press?

805
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,220
-我不是媒体  -你也不是工作人员
- I'm not press. - You're not staff either.

806
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:09,890
抱歉
My apologies.

807
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:12,900
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood?

808
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,020
你做得对
You did the right thing.

809
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,070
我知道你很生气
I know you're angry.

810
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,360
你有权生气
You should be.

811
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,550
但我必须那么做
But I had to do it.

812
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,920
这算是道歉
Is this some sort of apology,

813
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,380
还是你想一吐为快
or you need to get something off your chest?

814
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,610
我希望你能努力去理解
I want you to try and understand.

815
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,090
理解
Understand?

816
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,920
-你所做的超出了...  -我知道
- What you did was beyond-- - I know.

817
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,740
你不只是第一夫人  大使
You're not only the First Lady, and an ambassador,

818
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,840
你也是我妻子
you're also my wife.

819
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,280
-什么顺序  -拜托  克莱尔
- In what order? - Oh, come on, Claire.

820
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,310
我所说的是为了他
I said what I said for him.

821
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,930
不是为我自己  不是为我们
Not for myself, not for us.

822
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,380
为了他  我们也不该做一份虚伪的声明
I felt we owed him more than a few false words.

823
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,560
你是要我原谅你  告诉你没关系吗
So you want me to forgive you? To say that it was okay?

824
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,200
-不  -因为我做不到
- No. - Because I can't do that.

825
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,950
我没这意思
I'm not asking you to.

826
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,040
那我们为什么还要讨论这个
Then why are we even discussing it?!

827
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,840
因为我想让你知道原因
Because I want you to know why.

828
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,390
我不在乎原因
I don't care why.

829
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,970
我不在乎你的原因是什么
I don't care what your reasons are.

830
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,950
没有任何原因
There is no reason that can possibly convince me

831
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,760
让你有权毁掉我们耗费数月推行的和平计划
that you should have sabotaged a peace plan we spent months on!

832
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,000
我犯了个政治错误
It was a political mistake.

833
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,800
是的  我承认  但如果我什么都不说
Yes, I admit that. But if I had said nothing,

834
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,790
他的死就毫无意义了
his death would have meant nothing.

835
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,170
不  不是死  他那不叫死
No. Not death. Don't give him that.

836
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,990
-是自杀  -不
- Suicide. - No.

837
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:37,760
无法否认的事情  我不会否认的
Something undeniable. I was not gonna try and deny it.

838
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,930
-我都不明白你什么意思  -如果你肯给我机会
- I don't even understand that. - If you'd give me a chance.

839
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,080
我已经给了你机会  休会任命
I gave you a chance with the recess appointment,

840
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,470
决议案  还有跟科里根谈
with the resolution, with handling Corrigan.

841
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,100
他别无选择  弗兰西斯  我们把他逼入绝境了
He didn't have a choice, Francis. We cornered him.

842
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,430
-他有选择  -在他看来没有
- He did have a choice. - Not in his mind.

843
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,810
没人逼他在莫斯科抗议
No one forced him to protest in Moscow.

844
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,920
我们也绝对没有让他
And we sure as hell didn't ask him

845
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,210
用你的围巾上吊自杀
to tie your scarf around his neck!

846
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,310
如果你跟他谈过
If you had spoken to him...

847
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,090
听听他的话
and heard what he had to say--

848
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:05,870
怎么  我就会豁然开朗吗
Oh, what, I would have had some moral epiphany?

849
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,480
-是的  你会的  -我不这么认为
- Yes, you would have. - I don't think so.

850
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,290
因为我是美国总统
Because I'm the President of the United States

851
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:13,430
我能分清孰轻孰重
and I can separate the big from the small.

852
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,300
他并不轻
He wasn't small.

853
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,970
他是个懦夫  我很高兴他死了
He was a coward and I'm glad he's dead.

854
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,430
他比你勇敢得多
He had more courage than you'll ever have.

855
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,840
你真要讨论勇敢吗  克莱尔
Do you really want to discuss courage, Claire?

856
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,770
因为任何人都可以自杀
Because anyone can commit suicide,

857
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,040
或是在摄像机前口无遮拦
or spout their mouth in front of a camera.

858
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,810
但你知道什么才叫真正的勇敢吗
But you wanna know what takes real courage?

859
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:44,450
无论内心有何感受  都能管住嘴巴
Keeping your mouth shut, no matter what you might be feeling.

860
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:48,890
形势如此严峻  仍能不乱阵脚
Holding it all together when the stakes are this high.

861
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,250
是我们杀了他  弗兰西斯
We're murderers, Francis.

862
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,290
不  不是的  这叫适者生存
No, we're not. We're survivors.

863
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,070
如果我们不能对这个勇敢的人表示敬意
If we can't show some respect for one brave man

864
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,050
而继续完成我们原本的计划
and still accomplish what we set out to do,

865
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,560
那我会对我们俩都很失望
then I'm disappointed in both of us.

866
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,400
我就不该任命你做大使
I should've never made you ambassador.

867
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:12,190
我就不该让你当上总统
I should've never made you president.

868
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,770
看什么看
What are you looking at?

870
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:47,160
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}今年二月  奥巴马的挚友  两次总统竞选团队的总军师  大卫·阿索罗
出版回忆录  披露奥巴马实际上一直都支持同性恋婚姻
但是在08年的时候因为顾及选票  而硬着头皮表示反对同性恋婚姻合法化
但是到了2012年大选前夕  奥巴马决定"立场出柜"
转变自己08年的态度  接受ABC电视台专访  公开支持同性婚姻合法化
在此之前  奥巴马通过同国会的谈判
废除了美国军中"不许出柜"的软性同性恋禁令
LGBT(同性  双性  变性)群体也是奥巴马两次总统选举中
最坚定的支持群体之一
有着基督教传统的美国社会  一度非常反对同性婚姻合法化
但近些年  主流民意已经发生很大变化
越来越多的人对同性恋权益表示支持
在奥巴马和最高法院的推动下  目前美国已有37个州承认同性婚姻合法
