40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,740
所以我见过成千上万次的
Means I'm free to bail on a speech

41
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,830
陈词滥调我想翘就翘
I've already seen ten thousand times.

42
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,620
没有天生的...
You are entitled...

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,460
-福利  -你少来
- to nothing. - Stop.

44
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,570
我说明白了  我觉得...
Let me be clear. I say, I say...

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,070
你过来  小子
Come here, boy.

46
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,420
没有天生的...
You are entitled...

47
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,060
福利
To nothing!

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,740
事实就是  美国梦破灭了
Now, here's the truth: The American dream is broken.

49
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,420
我们连梦想都被剥夺了
And when we are robbed of our dreams,

50
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,010
告诉我  我们还有什么
well, let me ask you, folks, what are we left with?

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,160
一无所有
Nothing!

52
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,790
当我要求国会帮我将这个国家
And when I asked Congress to help me take this country

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,970
从福利国家变为充分就业的国家
from a welfare state to a fully-employed nation,

54
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,880
国会有什么行动
what did Congress do?

55
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,940
无动于衷
Nothing!

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,410
当我们证明了《美国就业法案》有用
And when we proved that America Works actually works,

57
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,940
在华盛顿创造了五万个岗位
when we created 50,000 jobs in Washington DC,

58
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,310
国会这下有行动了
Congress didn't just stop at nothing,

59
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,010
他们扼杀了进步
they killed progress in its tracks.

60
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,150
相信我  我明白你们的感受
Believe me, I know how you feel.

61
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,280
但我们得记住来这里的目的
But we have to remember why we're here.

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,220
我们得把愤怒转化为行动
We have to turn that anger into action.

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,270
夫人  杜兰特国务卿
Ma'am, it's Secretary Durant,

64
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,400
-有急事找您  -《美国就业法案》能成功
- she said it's urgent. - America Works will succeed,

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,660
但我们需要你们的帮助
but we need your help.

66
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,560
什么事
Hello?

67
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,860
得让他们知道支持弗兰克·安德伍德
You need to let them know that a vote for Frank Underwood

68
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,320
就是支持《美国就业法案》
is a vote for America Works!

69
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,750
支持弗兰克·安德伍德就是支持《美国就业法案》
A vote for Frank Underwood is a vote for America Works!

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,940
今早我有幸
Now, I had the great pleasure

71
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,110
结识了一个叫格洛丽亚的姑娘
of meeting a woman this morning named Gloria.

72
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,130
她有爱荷华州立大学学位
She has a degree from Iowa State University

73
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,040
凭她的学历还是找不到工作
and even with her degree, she can't get employed.

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,980
为什么  为什么会这样
Now, why? Why is that the case?

75
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,960
因为  我妻子  女士们  先生们
Becau-- My wife, ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,450
我觉得我妻子想
I think what my wife is gently

77
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,190
委婉地告诉我  我超时了
trying to tell me is that I've run overtime.

78
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,930
她给我取了个很合适的外号
She has a very clever nickname for me.

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,930
-"话唠"  -是啊
- "Verbosity." - Yeah.

80
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,080
克莱尔和我最大的区别
Now, the main difference between Claire and me,

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,440
当然除了她的美丽之外
aside from her stunning beauty, of course,

82
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,900
是她真明白这个词的意思
is that she actually knows what that word means.

83
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,720
我很乐意在这里待一个下午
Now, look, I would love to stay here all afternoon

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,210
回答你们所有的问题
and answer all your questions,

85
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,200
但那样我就得让
but then I'd leave all your friends

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,650
锡达拉皮兹的朋友们等我了
in Cedar Rapids waiting for me

87
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,480
他们已经等很久了  那可不好
even longer than they have and we don't want to do that.

88
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,660
感谢大家今天前来看我
So I want to thank you all for coming out to see me today,

89
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,590
听我讲我们参与的这场斗争
to hear about this battle, this fight we're in.

90
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,280
你们要在党团会议中支持我
I want you to caucus for me,

91
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,950
帮格洛丽亚找到工作
and let's help get Gloria a job!

92
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,390
有你一票  才有《美国就业法案》
America Works only if you make it work!

93
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,730
天佑爱荷华  天佑美利坚合众国
God bless Iowa! God bless the United States of America!

94
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,840
-谢谢  -安德伍德  安德伍德
- Thank you! - Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!

95
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,100
简易爆炸装置  就在90号公路旁
An IED right off Route 90,

96
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,620
距约旦河三千米处
three kilometers from the Jordan River.

97
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,080
-什么时候  -36分钟前
- When? - Thirty-six minutes ago.

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,690
一队俄国士兵在巡逻  两辆装甲车被毁
Russian unit was on patrol. Two armored vehicles were destroyed.

99
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,950
-8名士兵全部遇难  -凯茜给谁打电话呢
- All eight troops were killed. - Who's Cathy spoken to?

100
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,680
外交部长仍未回电话
Foreign Minister hasn't returned her call.

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,880
我们要确保联合国秘书长保持沉默
We have to make sure the Secretary General doesn't say anything

102
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,110
直至我们能更好地控制事态
until we have a better handle on this.

103
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,430
雷米  我需要立即与佩特罗夫通话
Remy, I need to speak to Petrov immediately.

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,660
我联系了克里姆林宫  对方说稍后回话
I contacted the Kremlin. They said he'll reach out soon.

105
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,880
我们需要联合国去调查爆炸地点
We need the UN to investigate the blast site.

106
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,380
俄国人已经拉起警戒线  不让任何人接近
The Russians have cordoned it off. They're not letting anyone in.

107
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,480
-为什么  -我们不清楚
- Why not? - We don't know.

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,720
我们有个小队在附近  听到爆炸  想去帮忙
We had a unit nearby that heard the blast, went in to help.

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,900
-俄国人拒绝了  -我不喜欢这气氛
- Russians turned them away. - I don't like the feel of this.

110
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,160
凯茜说以色列想派出他们自己的人
Cathy says the Israelis want to send in their own team.

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,290
这绝对不行
We can't let that happen.

112
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,800
以色列一到...
The second Israeli boots hit the ground--

113
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,360
雷米  我不管你使什么办法
Remy, I don't care what you have to do,

114
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,740
接通佩特罗夫的电话
you get Petrov on the phone.

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,200
我们必须阻止事态酝酿
We need to head this off at the pass.

116
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,910
并确保国会中没人反应过激
And make sure no one in Congress overreacts either.

117
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,650
比赛怎么样
How was the game?

118
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,160
棒极了  直到我手机开始响个不停
Great, until my phone started blowing up.

119
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,030
我看看你写得怎么样了
Let me see what you have so far.

120
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,470
不行
No.

121
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,460
这样不行  语言过于直白
This is no good. The language is too obtuse.

122
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,480
-这样简单  直接  -听着  是这样的
- Simpler. More direct. - Look, here's the deal:

123
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,760
如果俄国不配合  以色列就会紧张
If the Russians don't play ball, the Israelis will get nervous.

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,360
如果以色列出兵  巴勒斯坦就会勃然大怒
If the Israelis send troops in, the Palestinians will go apeshit.

125
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,830
如果巴勒斯坦发怒  就可能搬出迫击炮
If the Palestinians go apeshit, there could be mortar attacks.

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,780
如果出现那种情况  整个维和行动
And if there are mortar attacks, the whole peacekeeping mission

127
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,490
-就泡汤了  -你想让我就这么写吗
- could go down the drain. - You want me to actually say that?

128
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,980
天啊  当然不  恰恰相反
God, no. We need to say the opposite.

129
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,910
听着  清楚描述一番
Look, make it as clear as

130
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,000
我刚刚形容的末日局势
the doomsday scenario that I just described,

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,480
但随后180度转弯  表示无需紧张
but then flip it around and put a happy face on it.

132
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,570
其他的都能重新安排
We can reschedule everything else,

133
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,840
但是我担心哈兰·特劳伯
but I'm concerned about Harlan Traub.

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,130
爱荷华民主党主席
The IDP Chairman.

135
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,420
也是食品加工协会的主席
And President of the Food Processors Association.

136
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,650
他在州内很有影响力
He's big for us statewide.

137
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,830
我们本约好今晚与他见面
We were supposed to meet with him tonight.

138
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,800
现在出现了紧急国家安全事务
Well, this is a national security emergency.

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
他还没与邓巴会面
He hasn't met with Dunbar yet.

140
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,090
如果我们取消  她就能先跟他联系
If we cancel, she gets a clean shot at him.

141
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,150
好吧  那就让他也上飞机
All right, so put him on the plane.

142
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,390
别忘了选举委员会的规则
FEC rules.

143
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,780
在空军一号上拉票每小时花费17.9万
Campaigning on Air Force One costs 179,000 an hour.

144
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,590
-更别提这传出去的影响  -那我不拉票
- Aside from the message it sends-- - Alright. So I won't campaign.

145
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,330
反正我也没时间  让他感到受优待就行
I won't have time anyway. Uh, just make him feel special.

146
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,100
然后安排他在华盛顿跟我见面
Give him some face time in Washington.

147
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,230
怎么样
Anything?

148
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,640
莫里科夫的办公室在搪塞我
Moryakov's office is giving me the runaround.

149
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,960
简易爆炸装置炸死八名
An IED has killed eight Russian troops

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,780
在约旦河谷巡逻的俄罗斯士兵
on patrol in the Jordan Valley.

151
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,210
截至目前尚无人声称对此次袭击负责
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for this attack.

152
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,190
克里姆林宫对此的唯一反应是一份来自
The only reaction from the Kremlin, a brief written statement

153
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,790
外交部长布加耶夫的简短声明  援引如下
from Foreign Minister Bugayev that reads, quote,

154
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,000
"袭击者会被绳之以法"  引述完毕
"The perpetrators will be found and brought to justice." End quote.

155
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,010
-20分钟后出发  -我得去我房间拿行李
- Wheels up in 20 minutes. - I gotta grab my bags from my room.

156
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,710
-好的  外面见  -我们该分开搭车
- Okay. Meet me out front. - We should take separate cars.

157
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,780
这种地方  飞机起飞你都打不到车
A cab won't even get here before the plane takes off.

158
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,050
跟我走吧
You're coming with me.

159
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,120
遵命
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,920
今天不是逃学的好日子
Not a good day to play hooky.

161
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,130
今晚要熬到很晚了
It's gonna be a late night here.

162
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,300
取决于佩特罗夫的行动
It depends what Petrov does.

163
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,030
目前为止  只有刺耳的沉默
So far, just incredibly loud silence.

164
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,750
我得走了  宝贝  外交部要召开紧急会议
I gotta go, hon. Foreign Affairs is holding an emergency session.

165
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,130
我也爱你
I love you, too.

166
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,990
-我时间不多  -我也是
- I don't have much time. - Neither do I.

167
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,310
讲话要点
Talking points.

168
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,450
这让我很不自在
These make me uncomfortable.

169
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,390
即使是非公开会议  我的话也会泄露
Even in a closed session, whatever I say will get out.

170
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,610
-我会因此在爱荷华受挫  -你不能挑剔任务
- I'll take hits in Iowa. - You can't criticize the mission.

171
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,950
我们需要你让大家保持平静
We need you to keep everyone calm.

172
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,460
你知道我对不必要的军事干涉的看法
You know how I feel about unnecessary military involvement.

173
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,800
是你要求做竞选搭档的  杰姬
You asked to be on the ticket, Jackie.

174
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,410
而你从一开始就各种不配合
It's been non-stop resistance from the start.

175
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,650
如果你不能支持总统
If you don't want to support the president,

176
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,060
那你就不该做他的副总统
you shouldn't want to be his number two.

177
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,710
我受够跟你扯皮了
I'm sick of pulling teeth.

178
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,670
你说得对  我会尽力的
You're right. I'll do what I can.

179
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,000
杰姬
Jackie...

180
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,520
我不是故意发火的
I didn't mean to snap.

181
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,970
我知道一边在这边保持影响力
I know it's hard having a presence here

182
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,840
一边竞选是很难的
and campaigning at the same time.

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,230
艾伦和孩子们肯定也不好受
I'm sure it's tough on Alan and the kids, too.

184
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,230
其实艾伦帮助很大
Alan's been a big help, actually.

185
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,920
我很高兴他在你需要的时候能支持你
I'm glad he's stepping up, giving you the support you need.

186
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,900
我还以为我会讨厌结婚
I thought I would hate it, the whole marriage thing.

187
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,590
结果还不错
But it's nice.

188
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,040
我能回家时  大家都围在桌旁
When I can get home, everyone around the table.

189
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,590
我有时甚至还做饭
I even cook sometimes.

190
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,970
-很难吃  他们都不忍心说  -不会吧
- Badly, but they indulge me. - No.

191
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,570
-我也有贤惠的一面  -穿围裙什么的吗
- I have my June Cleaver moments. - Apron and all?

192
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,780
别闹
Don't push it.

193
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,360
我记不得上次在家做饭吃是什么时候了
I can't remember the last time I had a home-cooked meal.

194
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,980
-会议要开始了  -是啊
- Session's about to start. - Yeah.

195
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,750
有消息我通知你
I'll fill you in after.

196
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,750
汤姆
Tom.

197
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,890
-你这一天干什么去了  -抱歉  写书呢
- Where have you been all day? - Sorry. Working on the book.

198
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,940
我知道我们本该找机会谈谈的
I know we were supposed to have an opportunity to speak,

199
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,980
-但现在的情况显然...  -当然
- but obviously now, it's-- - Of course.

200
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,050
你如果想到前面去  尽管去
Listen, you can come up and sit up front if you like.

201
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,640
-我和克莱尔谈过了  -后面挺好  谢谢
- I spoke to Claire about it. - I'm fine back here. Thanks.

202
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,100
那好
Okay.

203
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,770
我需要知道我的护照就要解锁了
I need to know this passport lock is being lifted.

204
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,220
先让我看看你的进展
Show me what you got.

205
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,040
我受够被人牵着鼻子走了
I'm tired of being strung along.

206
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,200
-有地点吗  -有  但我要知道还得多久
- You have a location? - Yeah. But I want a timeline.

207
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,940
-一两周吧  -不行
- Week or two. - No.

208
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,510
他们已经不再给我分配任务了
They've stopped giving me new assignments.

209
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,310
这意味着他们要动手收拾我了
That means they're getting ready to fuck me.

210
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,020
你必须再快点
It has to happen sooner than that.

211
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,850
你在干什么
What are you doing?

212
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,220
给国安部的朋友发邮件
E-mailing a friend in Homeland.

213
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,210
他回复我一向很快
He always gets back to me quickly.

214
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,650
满意了吗
You satisfied?

215
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,230
瑞秋
Rachel.

216
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,170
-这上面说无名女  -不  就是她
- It says Jane Doe. - No, it's her.

217
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,240
就是她
It's her.

218
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,590
她偷了一个叫丽贝卡·桑兹的女孩的身份
She ghosted the identity of a girl named Rebecca Sands.

219
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,190
生日很接近
The birthday's pretty close.

220
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,550
1990年8月  然后她93年就死了
It's August 1990, then she died in '93,

221
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,270
全家身亡
along with her whole family.

222
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,670
但她的社保号码6个月前被激活了
But her social went active about six months ago.

223
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,180
但这上面没写丽贝卡·桑兹  写的是无名女
But this doesn't say Rebecca Sands. It says Jane Doe.

224
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,720
州警在水沟里发现了她的尸体
State troopers found her body in a ditch,

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,510
就在图森市外的一个废弃建筑工地上
in an abandoned construction site outside of Tucson.

226
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,390
你这  连张照片都没有
I mean, there's no-- There's no picture.

227
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,240
什么都证明不了
There's no proof of anything.

228
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,600
"并且不要叫神的圣灵忧愁
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God

229
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,420
你们原是受了他的印记  等候得赎的日子来到
by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

230
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,610
一切苦毒  恼恨  忿怒  喧嚷
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger

231
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,850
毁谤  同一切的恶毒  都要从你们中间除掉"
and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you."

232
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,000
不
No.

233
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,900
-不  不  这不是她  -指纹都有
- No, no. That's not her. - Come on, man. There's fingerprints.

234
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,540
这是你给我的那本《双城记》上面的指纹
Fingerprints from the Tale of Two Cities book that you gave me.

235
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,660
我和验尸报告比对过了
I ran it against the autopsy report.

236
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,440
和这位无名女完全吻合
It was a ten-point match with Jane Doe.

237
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,900
马上给我解锁护照
I need the passport lock lifted now.

238
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,220
-我会办的  -什么时候办
- I'm on it. - When will you be on it?

239
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,200
-尽快  -尽快是多快
- Soon. - Soon? How soon?

240
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,680
有多快是多快
As soon as I can!

241
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,950
我履行了约定  给我解锁护照
I did my part. Get the lock lifted.

242
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,940
这是赛斯·格雷森的号码
You've reached Seth Grayson.

243
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,900
有事请留言  我会尽快回复
Leave a message, I'll get back to you.

244
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,330
我得见他
I need to see him.

245
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,840
我母亲去世了
My mother died.

246
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,710
拜托
Come on!

247
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920
你没事吧
Are you okay?

248
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,130
伙计  你怎么回事
Hey, man. What the fuck?

249
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,480
对不起
Sorry.

250
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,710
简直难以置信
You believe this guy?

251
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,370
你是不是该和她说对不起  混蛋
You want to say it to her, shithead?

252
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,010
对不起  好吗  我很抱歉
Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.

253
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,360
-我请你们喝酒  -我们不用你请  混蛋
- Drinks on me. - We don't want drinks, shithead.

254
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,910
你得走了  汤米  这家伙喝醉了
You need to get out of here. Tommy, this guy's trashed.

255
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,390
给  我请你们喝酒
Here. Drinks on me.

256
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,960
不不  我们不想喝酒  我们希望你离开
No, no. We don't want drinks. We want you to leave.

257
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,890
别这样  拿着吧  我都说对不起了
Come on. Just take it. I said I was sorry.

258
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,850
-我才不管  -拿着吧
- I don't give a shit. - Take it.

259
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,980
不行  他得道歉
No, he's apologizing. I'm telling you.

260
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,290
对不起
Sorry.

261
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,760
-对不起  对不起  对不起  -我打烂你脸
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! - I will bust your fucking face!

262
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,860
-冷静一下  我给你叫辆出租车  -好吧
- Calm down. Let me get you a cab. - Okay.

263
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,750
大家好  恐怕我没有什么新消息
Hello, everyone. I'm afraid I don't have much news.

264
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,580
我们已经和俄国取得了联系
We are in touch, uh, with the Russians,

265
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,060
但了解到的细节还很少
but there's very few details.

266
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,310
我正在等待与佩特罗夫总统通话
I'm waiting to speak with President Petrov.

267
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,130
-为什么耽搁至今  -他刚失去八名士兵
- Any reason for the delay? - He just lost eight soldiers.

268
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,940
他现在首先要和他们的家人谈话
Talking to their families is his priority

269
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,110
换做是我也会这样做
as it would be mine.

270
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,350
您认为这会危及到维和任务吗
Do you think this could jeopardize the peacekeeping mission?

271
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,390
每个派出部队的国家
Well, every country that contributed troops

272
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,050
都明白这样的事可能发生
knew that something like this was a possibility.

273
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,850
但俄国当初很反对这个计划
But the Russians fought this plan hard.

274
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,400
这给了佩特罗夫完美的撤兵借口
This gives Petrov the perfect out.

275
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,120
我不会妄加揣测佩特罗夫总统的想法
I wouldn't presume to know what President Petrov is thinking.

276
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,770
等我们有机会谈过以后我会知道更多
I'll know more once we have a chance to speak.

277
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,570
那么国会呢  他们当初也不支持这项任务
What about Congress? They weren't fans of this mission.

278
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,390
我们一回去  我就会和国会领导层
I'm gonna consult with congressional leadership

279
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,170
进行讨论
as soon as we get back.

280
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,350
与此同时  我主要
In the meantime, my focus

281
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,470
要尽我所能帮助俄国人
is to help the Russians in any way that I can.

282
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,960
他们不许任何人接近爆炸地点  你怎么能帮他们
How can you help them when they won't let anyone near the blast site?

283
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,480
这种说法还没得到确认
Well, that hasn't been confirmed.

284
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,380
当然  除非
Unless, of course,

285
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,530
你的情报来源比五角大楼还好
you have better intelligence than the Pentagon.

286
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,870
非常感谢大家  很快会有更多消息
Thank you all very much. More soon.

287
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,000
以色列想要公开指责巴勒斯坦应为攻击负责
Israel wants to go public, blame Palestine for the attack.

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,130
目前还没有证据呢
There's no evidence yet.

289
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,380
是的  他们要说的是
Yes, well, the message is that

290
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,940
巴勒斯坦应该管好自己国家的人民
Palestine should be keeping its people in check.

291
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,350
他们还从贝特谢安派出500名士兵
They've also moved 500 troops to a staging area

292
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,760
跨过边境去一处集结待命区
across the border from Beit She'an.

293
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,340
老天啊  再打给克里姆林宫试试
Christ. Try the Kremlin again, please.

294
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,310
打个哈欠提提神吧
You try yawning?

295
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,850
那对你管用  对我不管用
That works for you, not for me.

296
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,730
那喝点水呢  有时能有用
What about some water? Sometimes that helps.

297
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,100
我不需要喝水  我需要接通电话
I don't need water, I need a phone call.

298
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,130
你等电话的时候
Maybe you should talk to Traub

299
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,770
或许该和特劳伯谈谈
while you're waiting for that phone call.

300
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,240
-你不吃点吗  -我不饿
- You're not eating? - I'm not hungry.

301
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,050
我觉得你是不喜欢坐飞机
I think you don't like to fly.

302
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,310
把桌子当脱衣舞女的奶头一样抓得紧紧的
Holding onto that table like it's a stripper's tits.

303
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,890
哈兰  很抱歉让你久等了
Harlan. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

304
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,650
不必起身  龙虾味道如何
Please, don't get up. How's your lobster?

305
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,210
像今天早晨刚抓的一样新鲜
It tastes like it was caught this morning.

306
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,600
确实是刚抓的  空军一号一切都是最好的
Well, it was. Nothing but the best for Air Force One.

307
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,220
先生  我知道您现在有很多事要考虑
Sir, I know you have a million things on your mind,

308
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,720
但我非常想与您讨论一下如何推进
but I would just love to talk to you about how to modernize

309
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,990
爱荷华食品加工业的现代化进程
the food-processing industry in Iowa.

310
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,910
拜托  用他的餐刀杀了我算了
Please, slit my wrists with his butter knife.

311
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,400
我们不能在飞机上讨论大选  哈兰
We can't talk election on the plane, Harlan.

312
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,480
这是选举委员会严格禁止的
That's an FEC no-no.

313
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,960
这与竞选无关
This isn't about the campaign.

314
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,720
我们在谈论经济而不是党团会议  对吗  哈兰
We're talking about the economy, not the caucus. Right, Harlan?

315
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,180
十分正确
That's right.

316
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,880
相信您知道  先生  我们在玉米和大豆
I'm sure you're aware, sir, that we lead the states

317
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,900
生产上都领先各州
in corn and soybean production.

318
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,170
考虑到素食主义的流行  这是件好事
It's a good thing, given the trend towards vegan.

319
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,780
但我们的食品加工厂
But our food-processing plants--

320
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,320
-爱荷华最大的产业  -没错
- Well, the largest industry in Iowa. - That's correct.

321
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,360
他们渐渐赶不上时代了  先生
And they're slow on the uptake, sir.

322
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,530
我们需要联邦政府的拨款
We need federal funding to help subsidize

323
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,380
-资助转向更健康的...  -总统先生
- the transition toward healthier-- - Mr. President.

324
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,300
俄罗斯来电
our call from Russia.

325
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,280
非常抱歉  我得接这个电话
Oh. I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

326
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,810
但是哈兰  我们回头一定好好谈  我保证
But Harlan, we'll get into it, I promise.

327
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,690
维克多  真是可怕的惨剧  总统先生
Viktor, it's a terrible tragedy, Mr. President.

328
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,070
我深感同情
I feel for your loss.

329
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,740
这就是你们的人一直打个不停的原因吗
This is why your people were so persistent?

330
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,450
就为了让你表示哀悼吗
So you could offer your sympathy?

331
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,690
我们必须得沟通
It's important that we talk.

332
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,030
你不让任何人接近爆炸地点
You're not letting anyone near the blast site.

333
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,720
我们在自己进行调查
We're conducting our investigation.

334
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,690
让联合国调查员和你们一起调查
Well, is there anything wrong with allowing UN investigators

335
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,680
有什么不妥吗
to work in conjunction with your people?

336
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,450
联合国指挥官派我的人
UN Command sent my men on that patrol,

337
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,390
去整个河谷90号公路最危险的一段巡逻
the most dangerous stretch of Route 90 in the entire valley.

338
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,790
-是你派我的人去的  -我吗  你在说什么
- And you sent my men. - Me? What are you talking about?

339
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,960
你觉得我的人无关紧要
You saw my men as expendable.

340
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,030
维克多  维和部队不归我个人管
Viktor, I don't personally oversee the peacekeeping forces,

341
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,760
你不会真觉得
and you can't possibly think

342
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,260
把你的人派到危险地段
that there was some deliberate attempt

343
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,030
-是有意而为的吧  -不然我该怎么想
- to put your men in harm's way. - So I am to believe, what?

344
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,390
这是个巧合吗
That this was a random act of fate, yes?

345
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,980
听着  不管责任在谁
Listen, whoever's responsible,

346
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,130
我们不能让这件事离间我们的关系
we can't let them foment distrust between us.

347
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,240
我们要是不和  就正中他们下怀了
If we do, then they win.

348
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,710
让他们看到  意外让我们更团结
Let's show them that an incident like this makes us stronger.

349
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,720
让我们帮你查出幕后黑手
Let us help you find out who did this.

350
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,410
死的是俄罗斯人  俄罗斯会找出凶手
Russians are dead. Russia will find the killers.

351
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,180
我不明白你为什么拒绝我们的帮助
I don't understand why you're refusing our assistance.

352
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,840
因为我们不需要
Because we don't need it.

353
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,210
那我们能不能至少保持沟通
Well, can we at least keep the dialogue open?

354
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,080
在进行任何行动前互相商讨一下
Consult with each other before you make any move?

355
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,140
我要做我必须做的  总统先生
I'm going to do what I must, Mr. President.

356
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,470
维克多  请听我说  我们得
Viktor, please listen to me. We have--

357
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,070
对不起  总统先生  线路挂断了
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but the line has been disconnected.

358
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,660
他挂我电话
He hung up on me.

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,560
帮我接凯茜·杜兰特
Cathy Durant, please.

360
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,970
鲍德温说得没错
Baldwin was right.

361
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,490
死去的八名战士给了佩特罗夫一个借口
Those eight bodies give Petrov options.

362
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,360
他才没有潸然泪下  他在开香槟庆祝呢
He's not shedding tears, he's popping champagne corks.

363
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,940
我能听到
I can hear them.

364
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,540
不在这儿  先生  卫生间在这边
Not here. Sir. Restroom's this way.

365
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,830
刚那是谁  刚进来的那人是谁
Who was that? The guy who just came in?

366
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,060
没看到
Didn't see him.

367
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,560
我可以到你办公室去
I would've come to your office.

368
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,790
这是联合国唯一一间俄国没有监控的房间
This is the only room at the UN we don't monitor.

369
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,070
-我想你们也没有监控  -没  美国也没有
- I'm assuming you don't either. - No, we haven't bugged it.

370
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,810
-那我们能打开天窗说亮话了  -也该说了
- So we can speak openly. - I think we should.

371
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,270
你说  我听着
You talk. I'll listen.

372
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,250
巴勒斯坦说如果以色列军队进入河谷
Palestine says it can't control Hamas

373
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,670
他们控制不了哈马斯
if Israeli troops cross into the valley.

374
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,150
我们只能私下沟通  亚历克西
We have to back channel this, Alexi.

375
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,800
佩特罗夫不肯听弗兰西斯的
Petrov won't listen to Francis.

376
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,560
亚历克西  这事你不能坐视不管
Alexi, please. This whole thing, you can't let it devolve

377
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,930
让事态完全失控
into something nobody can control.

378
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,610
也许这就是目的所在
Well, maybe that was the objective.

379
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,420
什么目的
What was?

380
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,750
总统本来就反对这次维和任务
The President... never wanted the peacekeeping mission.

381
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,010
你刚说"目的"
You said "Objective."

382
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,030
你是说这都是计划好的吗
Are you telling me this was somehow planned?

383
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,730
我什么都没说
I haven't said anything.

384
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,580
但你想说
But you want to.

385
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,860
全世界都想知道这件事是谁干的
The whole world wants to know who is responsible.

386
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,670
你们的军队不让任何人进入爆炸地点
Your troops won't let anyone near the blast site.

387
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,730
因为他们不想让世人知道真相
Because they don't want the world to know.

388
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,930
我弟弟  他在俄罗斯联邦安全局
My brother... he's in the FSB.

389
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,240
我们一周前还说过话  那之后就没了音讯
We spoke a week ago. I haven't heard from him since.

390
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,600
你万分确定吗
Are you absolutely certain about this?

391
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,480
亚历克西  公开吧
Alexi, go public.

392
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,750
我们会庇护你的
We'll protect you.

393
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,680
就像你们庇护冯山德那样吗
Like you did Xander Feng?

394
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,450
这是两码事
That was different.

395
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,520
我还有家庭
I have a family.

396
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,170
俄联邦安全局以前也干过这种事
The FSB has conducted these sorts of operations before.

397
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,960
公寓被炸事件
The apartment complex that blew up,

398
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,010
{\pos(382,284)}{\an3}1999年9月
莫斯科等城市发生多起公寓被炸案
俄罗斯指责是车臣叛军所为
车臣叛军则指控是俄秘密部门所为

399
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,480
{\pos(382,284)}{\an3}2002年10月23至26日
俄突击队冲入莫斯科一家戏院
营救被车臣叛军扣压的七百名俄国人质
最终129名人质死亡
41名车臣叛军被击毙
多数人死于未知毒气

400
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,010
成了佩特罗夫用来进攻车臣的理由
Petrov used that to justify invading Chechnya.

401
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,210
剧院毒气事件
The opera house that was gassed,

402
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,480
那之后他换掉了所有省长
he removed all provincial governors after that.

403
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,510
我们的确认为第一件事与俄联邦安全局有关
We do believe the FSB participated in the first.

404
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,050
剧院事件我们仍不确定
We're still uncertain about the opera house.

405
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,220
但炸死他自己的士兵
But blowing up his own soldiers,

406
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,180
我还是觉得难以置信
I find that very difficult to believe.

407
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,370
他直截了当地说了吗  他说出口了吗
Did he tell you point blank? Did he say the words?

408
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,350
他把能说的都说了
He said as much as he could.

409
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,710
但他的暗示很明确
But the implication was crystal clear.

410
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,530
我相信他一定很令人信服
I'm sure he was very convincing.

411
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,890
俄国所有外交官都经过了
All Russian diplomats go through

412
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,620
俄联邦安全局的反情报训练
FSB counter-intel training.

413
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,430
他们想刺激我们做出行动
They're trying to provoke some sort of reaction out of us.

414
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,820
那他弟弟呢
But what about his brother?

415
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,360
他弟弟确实是在俄联邦安全局工作
It is true that his brother works for the FSB,

416
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,150
我们也的确上周后就找不到他了
and that we lost track of him last week.

417
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,630
这部分属实
That part of the story holds up.

418
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,300
我们对莫里科夫有什么了解
What's our profile on Moryakov?

419
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,000
我们有特工调查过他  先生  吉姆
We have our agent who's been assigned to him, sir. Jim?

420
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,730
莫斯科认为莫里科夫有点捉摸不定
Moryakov has been considered a bit of a wild card in Moscow.

421
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,790
佩特罗夫曾两次考虑将他召回
Petrov considered recalling him twice,

422
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,340
但碍于和他父亲的交情就不了了之
but held off because his father's a family friend.

423
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,840
这几个月来我们收集到些只言片语
Now, we picked up some chatter in recent months,

424
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,520
他对克林姆林宫处理约旦河谷问题的方式有所担忧
his misgivings with how the Kremlin's been handling the Jordan Valley.

425
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,600
但你觉得他会做叛徒吗
But does he strike you as a traitor?

426
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,340
他很难说  他极度民族主义
He's a complicated man. Fiercely nationalistic.

427
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,540
但他对佩特罗夫绝对有疑虑
But he definitely has doubts about Petrov.

428
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,820
我们至少该考虑一下这种可能吧
Shouldn't we at least entertain the possibility?

429
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,060
是啊  但我们怎么确定
Yeah, but how can we determine it

430
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,100
到底是怎么样的  如何确认
one way or the other? Definitively?

431
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
光靠卫星不够
Our satellites aren't enough.

432
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,160
我们得派人去爆炸地点
We'd have to get men to the blast site,

433
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,160
采集土壤样本和爆炸残片
retrieve soil samples and blast debris.

434
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,280
我们多快能派人过去
How soon could we get a team in?

435
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,290
72小时吧
I'd estimate 72 hours.

436
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,290
三天也太久了
Well, three days seems an awfully long time.

437
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,020
调派的基本准备不是已经就绪了吗
Don't we already have the basics in place for deployment?

438
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,340
但那没有考虑应对俄罗斯军队
That doesn't take into account the Russian forces.

439
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,590
我们想在出兵之前掌握更多情报
We'd want better intel before deploying.

440
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,020
那是不是随着时间推移
Am I correct in assuming that every hour that passes,

441
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,130
我们获取证据的几率也在降低
our chances of retrieving any proof diminish?

442
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,940
是的  先生
That is correct, sir.

443
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,950
那调派最快需要多久
What's the absolute soonest you can deploy?

444
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,020
12小时  总统先生
Twelve hours, Mr. President.

445
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,000
但这样就有极高的...
But that would involve an extremely high degree--

446
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,260
我知道有风险  上将
Yeah, I'm aware of the risk, Admiral.

447
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,560
胜算有多大
What are the odds of success?

448
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,610
说实话  先生  没有准确情报
Honestly, sir, without proper intelligence,

449
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,270
我最多只能说一半一半
I can't say better than 50/50.

450
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,720
你确定吗
You're certain?

451
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,430
我确定
Yes, I am.

452
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,990
那就准备行动
Let's put it in motion.

453
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,100
-总统先生  -马克
- Mr. President? - Mark.

454
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,250
不是应该联合国去调查
Shouldn't the UN be conducting the investigation

455
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,160
而不是俄罗斯吗
instead of the Russians?

456
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,530
俄罗斯在此次行动之初
The Russians have been our partners

457
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,390
就是我们的合作伙伴
in this mission from day one of deployment,

458
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,500
所以我认为他们是代表联合国进行自主调查
so I would say that they're conducting their own investigation on behalf

459
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,580
而不是取代联合国
of the United Nations, not instead of.

460
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,620
-总统先生  -萨拉
- Mr. President? - Sara.

461
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,440
那是不是说
Is it correct to say that

462
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,500
他们不会向联合国指挥部汇报
they are in no way reporting to UN Command?

463
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,470
在维和任务中  每个国家志愿派遣军力
In peacekeeping missions, nations volunteer their forces.

464
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,590
他们首先是听命于本国政府
They answer to their own governments first and foremost,

465
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,480
其次再是与联合国指挥部合作
then they cooperate with the UN Command.

466
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,030
两者有重要区别
That's an important distinction to make.

467
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,090
其他关于约旦河谷的问题
Now, any other questions with respect to the Jordan Valley

468
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,610
都请向国务院提出
should be directed to the State Department.

469
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,660
如果还有跟昨天的事
But if any of you have questions

470
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,450
无关的问题
that don't relate to yesterday's events,

471
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,890
我可以回答一下  斯黛芬妮
I'll take one or two. Yeah, Stephanie.

472
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,380
总统先生  我跟凯特都有个问题
Mr. President, Kate and I both had a question.

473
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,440
谢谢  斯黛芬妮
Thank you, Stephanie.

474
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,660
总统先生  您知道
Mr. President, are you aware, sir,

475
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,280
在空军一号上进行竞选活动
that campaigning on Air Force One

476
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,240
-是违反选举委员会规定的吗  -我知道
- is a violation of FEC rules? - Yes, in general, I am.

477
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,360
昨天哈兰·特劳伯也在飞机上
Harlan Traub was on the plane yesterday.

478
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,530
他出现在那儿的原因
It's hard to imagine he was there

479
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,970
大概只能是你在寻求他在爱荷华州的支持吧
for any other reason than you'd be seeking his support in Iowa.

480
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,390
你不知道  我跟他是老交情了
You don't know how long I've known him,

481
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,090
他昨天的确在飞机上
and yes, he was on the plane yesterday.

482
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,030
但我没进行选举活动就不算违规
But it's not a violation if you don't campaign, which I didn't.

483
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,890
我也就问了问
I think the extent of our conversation

484
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,530
他吃得怎么样
was asking him how he liked his meal.

485
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,010
不过我乐意接受选举委员会的裁决
But I'm happy to let the FEC decide.

486
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,660
还有谁要受人所托
Now, does anybody else have any question

487
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,530
问我什么问题吗
that somebody else asked them to ask me?

488
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,590
特劳伯呢
Where's Traub now?

489
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,710
酒店里  一小时内能到
At the Hay-Adams. Should be here in an hour.

490
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,760
被人看见他在白宫不好吧
It'd be bad if anyone saw him at the White House.

491
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,380
我现在都不想让他来首都
Well, I don't even want him in DC now.

492
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,930
我得处理俄罗斯的问题
The last thing we need is some bullshit FEC story

493
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,530
不能再让选举委员会找上茬
while I'm trying to deal with the Russians.

494
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,520
送他回爱荷华吧  你来处理
Let's get him back to Iowa. And you handle this.

495
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,330
你比沃恩更擅长与人打交道
You have better people skills than Vaughn.

496
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,250
你跟鲍德温谈
And you talk to Baldwin.

497
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,060
跟她说明白我们没违反任何规定
You make it crystal clear we violated no regulations.

498
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,320
先生  道格昨晚给我留言了
Sir? I got a voicemail from Doug last night.

499
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,240
-他说他母亲去世了  -真糟糕
- He said his mom died. - My God, that's awful.

500
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,120
可是茱莉亚·斯坦普十年前就去世了
Except Julia Stamper passed away ten years ago.

501
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,080
我知道  我去了葬礼
I know, I was at the funeral.

502
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,680
送些花吧  把道格请来吧
Send some flowers. Actually, get Doug in here.

503
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,140
我想亲自表示哀悼
I'd like to give my condolences in person.

504
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,700
通过《美国就业法案》
There's a whole host of ways

505
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,670
我们有很多在爱荷华州
we can revolutionize food processing in Iowa

506
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,620
革新食品加工业的办法
through America Works.

507
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,040
你们研发需要的补贴
The subsidies you want for R and D

508
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,550
-可以当作...  -你不用这样的
- can be financed as a jobs-- - You don't have to do this.

509
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,540
-哪样  -跟我说好话
- Do what? - Sweet talk me.

510
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,260
给我叫辆车就可以了
And a cab would've been fine.

511
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,640
我想亲自开车送你去机场
I wanted to drive to the airport myself

512
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,480
好聊聊  谈谈你的顾虑
so we had a chance to talk about your concerns.

513
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,090
我都跟候选人聊  不是司机
Well, I'm used to talking to candidates, not chauffeurs.

514
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,530
我不是司机
I'm not a chauffeur.

515
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,790
你不是开着车吗
Well, it's your hands on the wheel.

516
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,220
赛斯
Seth?

517
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,210
该死
Shit.

518
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,490
请出示车辆登记和保险证明
Registration and insurance, please.

519
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,240
抱歉  警官  钱包落在办公室了
I'm sorry, officer. I left my wallet at work.

520
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,060
车辆登记  保险证明呢
Registration? Proof of insurance?

521
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,570
-在钱包里  -应该放在车上的
- In my wallet. - You're supposed to keep it in the car.

522
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,930
是啊  但要是车被偷了  手续不也没了
Yeah. But if someone steals your car, why give 'em the paperwork?

523
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:19,850
好吧
All right,

524
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,000
请你下车吧  先生
I'm gonna need you to step out of the car for a moment, please.

525
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,500
警官  我是雷米·丹顿
Officer, my name is Remy Danton.

526
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,880
总统的幕僚长
I'm Chief of Staff to the president.

527
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,550
不出示证件的话  我也不知道你是谁  先生
Without your identification, sir, I don't know who you are.

528
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,070
-我有白宫的胸针  -那也没用  先生
- Got my government pin. - That doesn't matter, sir.

529
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,610
还是要出示证件
I still need to see your identification.

530
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,180
请下车吧
Would you step out of the car, please?

531
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,060
警官  搜一下雷米·丹顿  能搜到我的照片
Officer, you run a search on Remy Danton, you'll get my photo.

532
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,290
先生  请下车
Sir, I asked you to step out of the car. Please.

533
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,590
-带武器了吗  -当然没有
- Any weapons on you? - Of course not.

534
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,020
好  请站到车辆后方
All right. You mind stepping to the rear of the vehicle, please?

535
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,380
为了保险  我还是要搜一下
I'm gonna pat you down, just to make sure.

536
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,170
脚往后站
Feet back.

537
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,290
车是登记在一个弗吉尼亚州企业名下  没有地址
Car comes back to a Virginia corporation, no address.

538
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,890
我接触机密信息  身份自然是保密的
I'm cleared Top Secret, my information is masked.

539
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,070
先生  请你在这儿等一下
Sir, I need you to stay here for a moment, please.

540
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,480
-查到什么了  -没有地址
- What do you got? - No address on file.

541
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,740
-为什么拦下我  -稍等  先生
- Why'd you stop me? - One moment, sir.

542
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,680
不  别敷衍我
No, not one moment.

543
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,140
我有权知道你们为什么让我停车
I got the right to know why you stopped me.

544
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,350
先生  请你把手放在车上
Sir, I asked you to keep your hands on the car.

545
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,810
把你的警号告诉我
I'm gonna need your badge number.

546
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,270
想向你搭档炫耀吗  伙计
Trying to show off for your partner here, brother?

547
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,050
别叫我伙计  别逼我们拷你
I'm not your brother. Don't make us restrain you.

548
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,570
-戴维斯警官  -先生
- Officer Davis. - Sir.

549
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,880
柯克兰警官
Officer Corchoran.

550
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,440
这么着吧  我要照张照片
Know what? I'm gonna take a photo.

551
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,080
搞什么
What the fuck?!

552
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,980
-你们搞什么  -冷静点
- What's your problem?! - Calm down!

553
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,920
先生
Sir!

554
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,690
把你的警号给我
I'm gonna need your badge number!

555
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,590
丹顿先生  我是希克森副队长
Mr. Danton, I'm Lieutenant Hixson.

556
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,810
我为此次误会向您道歉
I'm very sorry for this misunderstanding.

557
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,020
小心别撞头
Watch your head.

558
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,260
我代表他们向您道歉  希望您能接受
I hope you accept my apology on their behalf.

559
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,990
-他们说让我停车是因为超速  -对
- They said I was stopped for speeding. - Yes.

560
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,610
当驾驶员无法出示驾照和车辆登记的时候...
When they encounter someone without a license and registration--

561
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,770
开罚单
Write up the ticket.

562
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,410
不用担心这个  先生  您可以走了
You don't have to worry about that, sir. You're free to go.

563
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,340
如果我当时超速了  就给我开罚单
If I was speeding, give me the damn ticket.

564
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,540
让您遭了这番罪  真的没这必要了
That's really not necessary after everything we put you through.

565
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,470
副队长
Lieutenant.

566
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,300
我也想请你上去  但孩子们
I'd invite you up, but the kids, they're--

567
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,200
我们准备这次带他们一起去爱荷华
We're bringing them to Iowa this trip

568
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,750
简直乱套了
and it's a total shit-show.

569
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,480
我来不是为了竞选的事
I didn't come here to talk to you about the campaign.

570
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,300
我可能...
I probably... you know,

571
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,540
我不该就这样跑来  但...
I shouldn't have just shown up like this, but...

572
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,300
来  到这边来
Here. Come this way.

573
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,640
真是丢人  我都不知道我为什么来
It's stupid. I don't even know why I came over.

574
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,190
发生什么事了吗
Did something happen?

575
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,330
我开车时  因为超速被警察拦下
I got pulled over. For speeding.

576
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,830
事情有点失控  开着豪车的黑鬼
Things got out of hand. A nigger in a nice car.

577
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,930
老天
Jesus.

578
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,030
我把钱包落在办公室了
I left my wallet at work.

579
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,150
我告诉他我是谁
When I tried to tell the guy who I was,

580
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,720
他却根本不相信
he didn't believe me, so...

581
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,610
我说不清
I don't know.

582
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,500
我也不相信我自己
I didn't believe me.

583
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,970
我手被铐住时就好像
There I was with my hands in cuffs and it was like, uh...

584
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,840
我根本不是我自己
it was like I was outside of myself.

585
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,580
我可能是任何人
I could've been anyone.

586
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,150
但就不是我自己
I wasn't me.

587
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,500
-这么说你能明白吗  -你只是吓坏了
- Does that make any sense? - You got rattled.

588

不  不是那样
No, it's not that.

发生这种事我连个倾诉对象都没有
This happened and I didn't have anyone to tell about it.

591
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,940
你有我呢
You have me, right?

592
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,390
你来我很开心
I'm glad you came over.

593
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,820
这不公平  这样打扰你
It's not fair. Intruding on you like this.

594
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,060
如果我认为你这是打扰  我根本就不会下来
If I thought you were intruding, I wouldn't have come downstairs.

595
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,820
我很抱歉  对不起

作为朋友  我会扶持你

你没权利问我这个

721
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,680
如今还要用你荒唐的幻想羞辱我吗
and now you insult me with these ridiculous fantasies.

722
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,610
你搞这一切想要什么  维克多
What do you want out of all of this, Viktor?

723
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,140
正义  我的士兵在你发起的行动中丧生了
Justice, for my soldiers who died on a mission you devised.

724
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,110
他们的死只能怪你
If anyone is to blame for their deaths, it's you.

725
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,380
再见  维克多
Goodbye, Viktor.

726
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,250
弗兰西斯  他说什么了
Francis, what did he say?

727
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,080
我得写完这封信
I have to finish this letter.

728
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,290
过去数小时内
Over the last several hours,

729
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,940
以色列军队进入了约旦河谷
Israeli forces entered the Jordan Valley.

730
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,070
有目击者称
Eyewitness reports say

731
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,450
他们驻扎营地的地方
they've taken up positions near the encampments

732
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,890
就在俄军的爆炸现场封锁线旁
where Russian troops are refusing access to a blast site

733
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,800
也是八名俄罗斯士兵丧生的地方
where eight of their countrymen were killed two days ago.

734
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,180
以色列总理说
The Israeli Prime Minister had this to say, quote:

735
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,730
"俄方拒绝撤军
"With both Russian forces refusing to leave

736
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,720
又有他国展开机密行动..."
and the presence of covert operations from other nations..."

737
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,300
哈马斯和黎巴嫩真主党要插手了
Hamas and Hezbollah are getting involved.

738
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,250
为什么
How?

739
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,350
他们曾宣称  如果以军过境就召集当地武装
They've vowed to raise local militias if the Israelis cross the border.

740
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:18,210
美方政府也未就机密行动一事发表声明
...nor has the American government regarding covert operations.

741
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,220
-这事可大了  -是啊
- This is gonna be bad. - Yeah, it sure is.

742
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,880
我得去白宫了
I should get to the White House.

743
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,430
出去时记得锁门
Lock the door on the way out?

744
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,510
以色列人
The Israelis.

745
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,790
我知道  我整晚都在看新闻
I know, I've been watching the news all night.

746
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,230
该去战况室了
We should get to the Situation Room.

747
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,540
我先写完  马上下去
Let me finish this first. I'll be right down.

748
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,960
好  在那儿见
All right, I'll see you down there.

750
00:48:54,190 --> 00:49:19,190
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}对于每一位美国总统来说
下达命令派出特种部队执行危险任务  都是一种赌博
在战场上  没有任何任务能够保证百分百成功
美军历史上有多次特殊任务惨败的教训
在讨论是否派出特种部队猎杀本·拉登时
经验丰富的前国防部长盖茨建议采取轰炸的方式  而不是派兵突袭
奥巴马最后决定派出最精良的海豹特工六队
但是出发前白宫和五角大楼都没有百分百的成功把握
幸运的是  虽然行动中美军损失了一架直升机
但是这次行动还是非常成功的
奥巴马的冒险也得到了政治上的巨大回报
在2012年的大选中  奥巴马一直拿猎杀拉登的行动
来证明自己在国家安全事务上卓有成效

752
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:44,190
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}但是白宫战况室里发出的命令  也有很多没有获得预期的成功
近来中东极端恐怖组织杀害了多名美国人质
悲剧发生后  美国军方向媒体吐露
奥巴马曾经下令特种部队对人质进行营救
但是由于情报等原因  营救行动均未成功
