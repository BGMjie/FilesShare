或许我就是害羞呢
Maybe I'm shy.

62
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,650
才不是  你就是不屑于跟平头百姓打交道
Oh, no, you're not. You just don't mingle with the peasants.

63
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,370
要说我们谁是平头百姓  那也是我
If one of us is a peasant, I think it's me.

64
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,370
抱歉我不能留在加夫尼陪你

汤姆
Tom.

73
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,240
共和党要引入一份
The Republicans are introducing a bill

74
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,750
《斯塔福德法案》的修正案
that amends the Stafford Act.

75
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,300
他们说用联邦应急管理署的资金
They say that the siphoning of FEMA funds

76
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,220
来资助《美国就业法案》有违拨款法规
for America Works violates the appropriation.

77
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,380
让他们去吧
So let them.

78
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,880
两党都会支持
It's got bipartisan support.

79
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,850
邓巴会公开支持修正案
Dunbar's going to publicly support the bill.

80
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,790
-杰姬呢  -她不想搅进去
- What about Jackie? - She's trying to stay out of it,

81
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,220
但如果投票了  她只能随大流
but if it goes to a vote, she's gotta go with the tide.

82
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,160
她的民调数字
We don't want her poll numbers

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,340
刚刚开始追上邓巴  不能这时受挫
to take a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.

84
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,730
如果他们通过修正案  我就否决
If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.

85
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,960
他们推翻  我就拒绝执行
If they override, I'll refuse to enforce.

86
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,670
等闹到最高法院
By the time it gets to the Supreme Court,

87
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,740
我们已经可以拿出就业成果了
we'll have jobs to show,

88
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,120
他们只能耍嘴皮子
they'll have nothing but rhetoric.

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,370
这是公关战  与法律无关
This is a public relations battle, not a legal one.

90
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,950
发声明吗
Statement?

91
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,880
就我说的  火药味儿轻点
Just what I just said, less combative.

92
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,310
我们怎么拍
So, how do we want to do this?

93
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,970
我认为第一夫人应该坐着  您站在她身后
I think the First Lady should sit. You behind her.

94
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,060
这样可以吗  安德伍德夫人
Does that work for you, Mrs. Underwood?

95
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,760
当然  效果好就行
Uh, yes, whatever works best.

96
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,970
我先为夫人调灯光  然后给您找位置  先生
Let me adjust the light for her, and then I'll place you, sir.

97
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,620
非洲集团给
The African bloc just added

98
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,600
维和决议案加了一项条款
a provision to the peacekeeping resolution.

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
什么内容
What does it say?

100
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,560
要求非洲指挥维和军队
Requires African command of the forces.

101
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
这是故意坏事  弗兰西斯
It's a poison pill, Francis.

102
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,680
以色列和巴勒斯坦都不可能同意
There's no way Israel or Palestine will get on board with that.

103
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,420
你觉得是俄罗斯在指使吗
You think the Russians are behind it?

104
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,740
可能吧  凯茜和我还在调查
Probably. Cathy and I are investigating.

105
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,570
好了  总统先生  请站在您妻子身后
All right, Mr. President. Just behind your wife, please.

106
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,810
不要我放吗
Do you prefer I not?

107
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,100
什么
What?

108
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,440
您放手的位置很好
Where you had your hand is perfect.

109
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,920
很好  好了  拍了
Great. All right. Here we go.

110
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,700
请再笑一点
A little more of a smile, please.

111
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,680
请进
Come in.

112
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,160
今天有进展吗
Any luck today?

113
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,040
莫里科夫  说不是他们
Moryakov... says it wasn't them.

114
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,130
我倒不怎么相信他
Not that I trust him.

115
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,360
现在我只能设法让津巴布韦开口了
So now I just need to see if I can get Zimbabwe to talk.

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,040
今天  我们拍照的时候
Today, when we took the photo...

117
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,070
我碰了你的肩
I touched your shoulder.

118
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,240
怎么了
Yes?

119
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,240
你躲了一下
You flinched.

120
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,560
-什么  -我感觉到了
- What? - I felt it.

121
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,060
没有啊
No, I didn't.

122
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,560
就好像...
It was like...

123
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,090
你缩了一下
you recoiled.

124
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,630
我觉得你是想多了
I think you're reading too much into something

125
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,630
而且我觉得根本没这回事
that I don't think actually happened.

126
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,010
好吧  当我没说过
All right. Forget I said anything.

127
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,220
等等
Wait.

128
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,180
我就是...
I just...

129
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,000
算了  我也不知道我是想说什么
Never mind. I don't know what I was gonna say.

130
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,670
晚安
Good night.

131
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,340
房子应该就在那边
House must've been somewhere out there.

132
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,360
如果能算得上是房子
Well, if you can call it a house.

133
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,060
不比那辆卡车大多少
It was no bigger than that truck.

134
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
农场完全拆了  这倒也好
Nothing left of the farm, which is for the best.

135
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,480
桃树在这里都不结果
Peaches didn't want to grow here anyway.

136
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,620
在表土下两英尺就是石头的地上
That's what you get for planting on land

137
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,520
种东西  还能有什么好结果
with solid rock two feet below the topsoil.

138
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,470
这事我们应该
You know, that's one of the points

139
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,190
在书里提及
that we should make in the book,

140
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,430
在合适的环境里辛勤劳作才能有结果
that hard work is only worth it in the right conditions.

141
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,180
我们想帮助大家成功
We want to set people up for success.

142
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,740
职业培训  合理的职业道路
Vocational training, legitimate career paths.

143
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,510
欢迎回来  加夫尼怎么样
Welcome back. How was Gaffney?

144
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,010
我们跟卡斯皮大使安排时间了吗
Do we have a time set for Ambassador Caspi yet?

145
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,450
她办公室那边在拖
Her office is stalling.

146
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,910
跟她约好  她在哪方便见面都行
Get her schedule. We'll go wherever she is.

147
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,830
她应该会参加今晚的鸡尾酒会
I think she'll be at the cocktail reception tonight

148
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,240
-在墨西哥领事馆  -我去打电话确认
- at the Mexican Consulate. - I'll call and find out.

149
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,600
那是什么
What's that?

150
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,580
今早寄来给你的
It came in for you this morning.

151
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,180
弗兰西斯吗
Francis?

152
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,690
约翰·帕斯特纳克  迈克尔·科里根的丈夫
John Pasternak. Michael Corrigan's husband.

153
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,150
最新的采访请求放在你桌上了
The latest pile of interview requests is on your desk,

154
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,950
大都跟科里根事件有关
most of them Corrigan related.

155
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,110
反歧视同性恋联盟希望你去他们的
And GLAAD wants you to be a keynote speaker

156
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,960
媒体颁奖典礼做主讲人
at their Media Awards Ceremony.

157
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,950
他怎么知道的
How did he know?

158
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,790
你婚誓重证的事吗  新闻上有
About your vows? It's been in the news.

159
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,900
不是  我喜欢郁金香的事
No, that I liked tulips.

160
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,900
你母亲工作吗
Did your mother work?

161
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,830
主要是做女仆
As a maid, mostly.

162
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,020
她挺受欢迎  因为她是白人
In high demand, because she was white.

163
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,740
大家认定她不会偷贵重东西
People assumed she wouldn't steal any valuables,

164
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,920
但她当然还是偷了
but of course she did.

165
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,370
我记得有一晚  她回家时拿着两枚蓝宝石耳环
I remember one night, she came home with two sapphire earrings.

166
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,030
第二天她拿去了斯帕坦堡的当铺
She took them to the pawn shop in Spartanburg the next day,

167
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,440
但前一晚她戴了一整晚  睡觉也没摘
but she wore them all night long, even slept in them.

168
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,390
她大概是想知道
I guess she wanted to know

169
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,610
戴真珠宝是什么感觉
what it felt like to have real jewelry,

170
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,550
哪怕只是几小时
even if it was just for a few hours.

171
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,400
这可别写进书里
That does not go in the book.

172
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,300
你父母怎么不多生几个孩子
Why didn't your parents have any more kids?

173
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,430
这跟我们的话题无关
That's not relevant to what we're doing.

174
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,920
我只是想了解你的家庭
I'm just trying to get a sense of your family.

175
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,200
谷仓应该就在那边
The barn must've been somewhere right over there.

176
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,820
我父亲以前会躲进谷仓避开我们
My father used to escape in there to get away from us.

177
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,990
一般还带一瓶酒进去
Usually brought a bottle with him.

178
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,860
你爱你父亲吗
Did you love your father?

179
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,220
他内心深处是个好人
He was a good man, down deep.

180
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,630
他十分爱我们
He cared for us greatly.

181
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,950
努力工作  供养家庭
Worked hard to put food on the table.

182
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,870
并不能总能做到  但并非他不努力
Didn't always succeed, but that wasn't for a lack of trying.

183
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,880
瞧  这不是回答
See... that's not an answer.

184
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,030
我问你你是否爱你父亲  你却不说
I asked you if you loved your father, you don't tell me.

185
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,440
你只说你希望我写的东西
You tell me what you want me to write.

186
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,630
你从一开始就是这样
Which is what you've done since the beginning.

187
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,640
你该开始说实话了
It's time to start telling the truth.

188
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,380
-你觉得我一直在撒谎吗  -我确定
- You think I've been lying? - I know you have.

189
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,310
你唯一没撒谎的一次  是在白宫那一晚
The only time you haven't is that one night in the White House.

190
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,960
我经历的最糟的一次历险  我告诉你们
The worst adventure I've ever been on. I can promise you...

191
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,360
-我不明白  -这游戏赢不了
- I don't get it. - The game is unwinnable.

192
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,730
-那有什么意义  -意义就在这里
- What is the point? - That is the point.

193
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,410
我认为我们
I find it unlikely that

194
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,080
如果反复重新开始  是不可能进步的
we'll ever progress by starting over and over again.

195
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,010
-但总得比这强  -天呐
- But it's got to be better than this. - Oh, God.

196
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,000
我们试试吧  何不呢
Okay, let's give it a shot. Why not?

197
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,420
-有件事很明确  -又重启了
- Something was very clear. - It just started over again.

198
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,140
总是一遍遍重启
It keeps doing that over and over.

199
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,110
你无视他的指示  他就让你从头开始
Ignore his instructions, he sends you back.

200
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,370
如果我遵照指示呢
What if I follow his instructions?

201
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,200
混乱一片  完全随机
Chaos takes over. Randomness.

202
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,780
根本无法遵从规则
It's impossible to follow the rules.

203
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,460
下次吧  这太接近我的现实生活了
Another time. It's too much like my real life.

204
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,610
再说  我们不该玩游戏
Besides, we shouldn't be playing games.

205
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,540
你应该向我提问
You should be asking me questions.

206
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,240
你要把我灌醉了
You're getting me drunk.

207
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,980
我肯定要记不住我问了什么了
I won't remember what I asked.

208
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,940
我上次喝得这么醉  我闯进了一座图书馆
The last time I got this drunk, I broke into a library.

209
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,730
在查尔斯顿  我母校
In Charleston, my alma mater.

210
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,990
桑蒂诺
The Sentinel.

211
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,940
我差点吐在自己身上
I almost puked all over myself.

212
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,330
第八章  《总统大吐》
That's Chapter Eight: "POTUS Blows Chunks."

213
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,660
能小点声吗
Can you keep it down, please?

214
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,080
-一起来嘛  -抱歉
- Come join us. - So sorry.

215
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,450
-我都睡了  -这样啊...
- I was asleep. - Oh. We'll...

216
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,490
-我们去书房  -谢谢
- We'll move into the study. - Thank you.

217
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,850
弗兰西斯
Francis?

218
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,070
我就去
I'll be right there in a minute.

219
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,710
我不喜欢让他来这里
I don't like him being up here.

220
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,810
我们会小点声的
We'll be more quiet.

221
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,180
这是我们私人的空间
This is our private space.

222
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,850
-他是我的客人  -他是个陌生人
- He's my guest. - He's a stranger.

223
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,710
好吧  今晚之后  再不请他来了
All right. After tonight, no more.

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,350
我不是不讲理
I'm not being unreasonable.

225
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,320
我该...
I should've...

226
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,940
意识到我们是多吵
realized how much noise we were making.

227
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,400
能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

228
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,990
你不就是来问问题的吗
Well, that's what you're here for, isn't it?

229
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,910
你们怎么不睡一个屋
Why don't you sleep in the same room?

230
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,430
我们搬过来
Uh, that just sorta happened over...

231
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,360
几个月后  就开始了
a few months after we moved in here.

232
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,490
一切都还好吗
Everything okay?

233
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,990
你俩之间
Between you two?

234
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,610
当然
Oh, you bet.

235
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,220
虽然不算最好的时候
Well, it's been better.

236
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,950
不  不太好
No, it's not okay.

237
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,740
你俩从莫斯科回程时的争执
The fight. Coming back from Moscow.

238
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,570
你听到了
You heard us?

239
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,880
只听到吵嚷声  听不清话
The yelling. Not what you said.

240
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,780
我们不怎么吵架
We don't fight often, but, uh...

241
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,470
但这一次
This one...

242
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,230
总是揭旧伤疤
scabs keep coming off.

243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,130
我们说了些过分的话
We said things.

244
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,750
无法收回的话
Things you just can't take back.

245
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,530
很晚了  我们到此为止吧
It's late. We should call it a night.

246
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,260
托马斯
Thomas.

247
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,980
我对低俗内容没兴趣
I have no interest in salaciousness.

248
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,220
8月14日是罗斯福新政的纪念日
August fourteenth is the anniversary of the New Deal.

249
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,390
届时要达到两万
I'd like to hit 20,000 by that date.

250
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,460
应该没问题  先生
I believe we can do that, sir.

251
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,500
雷米  参议院用来挑战
Remy, what's the timeline

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,670
联邦应急管理署拨款合法性的修正案的进度如何
on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds?

253
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,980
立法办公室预测参议院法案
The Leg office predicts the Senate version

254
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,630
将在两三周内通过
will pass in two to three weeks.

255
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,200
我们在跟国会内的盟友想办法
Working with friendlies in the House.

256
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,830
搞点破坏  拖慢进度
Throw some pork on it, slow it down.

257
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,950
所以我们更该加速进展了
That's all the more reason that we need to accelerate.

258
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,310
如果我要否决这项法案
If I'm gonna veto this bill,

259
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,170
一定要拿阻碍五万人就业为理由
I want it to be because it's gonna kill 50,000 new jobs.

260
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,280
-我们创造的就业机会  -是  先生
- Jobs that we created. - Yes, sir.

261
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,470
凯茜
Cathy?

262
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,700
俄罗斯在约旦河谷问题上仍不肯妥协
The Russians remain intransigent on the Jordan Valley.

263
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,130
大使在努力
The ambassador is working hard

264
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,290
推动联合国大会就
to push the peacekeeping resolution to a vote

265
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,400
-维和决议案投票  -为什么延迟了
- by the General Assembly. - Why the delay?

266
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,660
我们无法说服非洲集团
We're having a hard time getting the African bloc

267
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,470
去掉坏事的条款
to remove the poison pill provision.

268
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,860
我们认为是以色列搞的鬼  他们临阵怯场
We think Israel's behind it. They got cold feet,

269
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,960
便让非洲集团
convinced the African bloc

270
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,660
破坏决议案进程  他们好下台
to sabotage the resolution so they have an out.

271
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,730
要我去跟总理谈谈吗
Do I need to speak to the Prime Minister?

272
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,050
以色列大使已经否认了
Uh, the Israeli ambassador has already denied.

273
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,720
我觉得我们该专注于条款本身
I think we need to keep our focus on the provision itself.

274
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,810
好吧
All right.

275
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,880
非洲集团的首领是津巴布韦
The head of the African bloc is Zimbabwe.

276
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,450
我们认为以色列保证
And we believe Israel has promised

277
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,460
给他们一个价值可观的艾滋防治援助项目
them a sizable aid package for HIV prevention.

278
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,950
国务卿和我建议
The Secretary and I recommend

279
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,360
提高我们给津巴布韦的救济金
increasing our relief funds to Zimbabwe.

280
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,520
超过以色列人
Outspend the Israelis.

281
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,750
金培图总统只会把钱中饱私囊
Well, President Chimbetu will just pocket the money.

282
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,170
我们早预计会遇到一定程度的腐败
Well, we always anticipate a certain level of graft.

283
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,860
一定程度  他是个贪婪透顶的恶魔
A certain level? He's egregious. The man's a monster.

284
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,350
可他是非洲集团的首领
Who happens to run the African bloc.

285
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,650
他是个要么屠杀人民  要么盗取他们财产的人
Who happens to kill his people when he's not stealing from them,

286
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,410
所以我才缩减了对津巴布韦的救济
which is why I reduced aid to Zimbabwe.

287
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,430
如果我们想让他撤销条款  我们就得有点筹码
If we want him to remove the amendment, we have to be persuasive.

288
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,230
我们已经在为《美就法》想方设法凑钱了
We are scraping together every penny we can to save AmWorks.

289
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,460
我最不需要的
The last thing I want

290
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,990
就是因为从国际开发署拨款给
is to be slammed for giving additional money

291
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,330
一个我想讨好的残忍独裁者
to a brutal dictator from USAID

292
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,750
而遭到抨击  这想法太糟了
just to persuade him. This is ill-conceived.

293
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,400
你提出这样的提议之前该三思
You should think before you bring a proposal such as this.

294
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,480
我们会考虑其他策略  再给您答复  总统先生
We'll pursue other strategies and get back to you, Mr. President.

295
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,630
谢谢  罗伯特  福利改革怎么样了
Thank you. Robert, what's the latest on the omnibus?

296
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,900
先生  法案再过
Sir, the legislation should go

297
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,690
两个月应该就能投票了
to the floor in the next couple of months.

298
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,120
领导层有反对...

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,240
联系洛克希德和诺斯罗普[均为军工企业]

300
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,800
我们付钱让人接受培训  当做是工作
We'll pay people to get trained and call it a job.

301
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,190
是不是工作工会说了算
It isn't a job unless the union says it is.

302
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,280
一步步来嘛
Well, one step at a time.

303
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,790
你安排培训  我去找劳工联合会谈
You set up the training and I'll speak to the AFL.

304
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,010
退休者协会的人来了吗
Are the AARP here?

305
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,410
在大堂  主席说他们要支持邓巴
In the lobby. The chairman told me they want to support Dunbar.

306
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,680
他们只是想敲打我们
They're just trying to rattle us.

307
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,940
邓巴保证要挽救社会保险
Dunbar is promising to save Social Security.

308
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,660
从华尔街和政府浪费挤钱  而不是福利
Go after Wall Street and government waste instead of entitlements.

309
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,720
叫他们进来
Well, get them in here.

310
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,370

他们的会面还有十分钟才开始
Their meeting's not for another ten minutes.

312
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,680
这就叫他们过来
Start bringing them over.

313
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,180
他们那么老  走过来也得十分钟了
It'll take them that long to hobble over on their walkers.

314
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,430
-弗兰西斯  -我去叫他们
- Francis? - I'll go get them.

315
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,810
我只有几分钟
I only have a few minutes.

316
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,430
你今天针对我是有意的
You singled me out today on purpose.

317
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,040
-什么  -内阁会议
- What? - The cabinet meeting.

318
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,770
如果我要让你参加内阁会议
If I'm gonna invite you to cabinet meetings,

319
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,560
就不能小心护着你
there's not gonna be any kid gloves.

320
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,880
别说得像照顾我
Don't make it sound like a favor.

321
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,860
你想去的  我同意了
You wanted to be there. I agreed.

322
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,130
为了获得信息  做好工作
Well, so I could be informed and do my job.

323
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,900
那房间里的每个人都靠工作能力受到审视
Everyone in that room is judged by what they bring to the table.

324
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,110
而你的工作不像样
What you brought to the table was amateurish.

325
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,440
凯茜和我一起提出了那个计划
Both Cathy and I proposed that plan.

326
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,220
我一样也怪她  你当我是在针对你
I fault her as much as you. You're making this too personal.

327
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,910
是针对我
It is personal.

328
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,220
我觉得你是在为俄罗斯的事惩罚我
I think you're punishing me for what happened in Russia.

329
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,430
得了
Oh, come on.

330
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,820
你在飞机上说  任命我是个错误
Well, you said it on the plane. Appointing me was a mistake.

331
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,900
你说的话更过分
Yeah, you said far worse things to me.

332
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,320
是啊  我也十分努力忘记那次的争吵
Yes, and I've gone out of my way to put that fight behind us.

333
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,040
是吗  像对托马斯那样
Oh, really? Like with Thomas?

334
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,160
我们把你吵醒  你就大吼大叫
When you screamed at us for waking you up.

335
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,260
-我才没大吼大叫  -你让我丢脸
- I didn't scream. - It was embarrassing.

336
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,700
谁管他怎么想呢
Who cares what he thinks?

337
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,220
他是我们的客人  你就那么走进来
He was our guest and you walked in there like--

338
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,750
我觉得你在无中生有
I think you're searching for things that aren't there

339
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,900
而对存在的问题又视而不见
and ignoring the things that are,

340
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,150
-比如拍照那档子事  -天呐
- like this photograph flinching nonsense.  - Oh, Jesus.

341
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,700
-你要我辞职吗  弗兰西斯  -别说傻话
- Do you want me to resign, Francis? - Don't be ridiculous.

342
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,030
说出来吧
Just say it.

343
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,930
你根本不希望我做大使
You never wanted me to be ambassador.

344
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,740
你记得你在飞机上对我说了什么吗
You remember what you said to me on the plane?

345
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,620
你不该让我当上总统
You should have never made me president.

346
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,450
我当时生着气  我不是那个意思
I was upset. I didn't mean it.

347
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,750
你就是那个意思  你觉得你造就了我
You did mean it. You think you made me.

348
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,390
不是的  我觉得我们是一个团队
No, I don't. I think we're a team, actually.

349
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,960
我们现在可不是
Well, we're not a team at the moment.

350
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,410
真难以置信我们变成了这样
I can't believe we've become this.

351
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,920
-什么样  -跟其他人一个样
- Become what? - Like everyone else.

352
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,080
可以了吗  先生
You ready, sir?

353
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,210
稍等一下  让烟味儿散去
No, just give me a minute. Let the smoke clear.

354
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,990
什么进度了
Where are we at?

355
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,190
她换发型了
Her hair's different.

356
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,370
但...
But I--

357
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,570
-这是在哪拍到的  -圣达菲
- Where was this taken? - Santa Fe.

358
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,860
我把搜索范围缩小到了那个城市
I've narrowed the search to focus just on that city.

359
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,060
我只有这么多  但我觉得这个开头不错
This is all I have, but I think it's a good start.

360
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,380
我该过去
I should go there.

361
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,730
不行  这是三周前的照片
No. These photos are three weeks old.

362
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,220
她可能只是路过那里
She might have been passing through.

363
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,630
也可能还留在那里
Or she might still be there.

364
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,540
好吧  但如果你去问东问西  可能会打草惊蛇
Okay, but if you start asking questions, you might tip her off.

365
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,760
那再找点信息来
Get me more, then.

366
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,160
我的护照怎么样了
How's my passport coming?

367
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,180
等你找到她  我就给你解锁
I'll get the lock lifted when you find her.

369
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,830
我也该看看你的进展
I think I should be seeing progress on your side, too.

370
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,770
这不够
This isn't enough.

371
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,820
他们又逮捕了我的一个朋友
They just arrested another one of my friends.

372
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,740
-他们随时能起诉我  -嘉文
- They could charge me at any minute. - Gavin...

373
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,340
我为了拿到这些  做了很糟糕的事
The things that I've had to do to get this much are fucked up.

准确地点
An exact location.

375
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,410

我要把所有客户都交给别人

So I can help the transition.

386
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,300
真舍不得你走
I'll be sad to see you go.

387
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,190
我去拿几根漂浮杆
I'll go get some bar floats.

388
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000

你会在国会失去很多盟友

我有点难过
It was a little hard.

441

Last night wasn't 'cause you felt sorry for me, was it?

442
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,420
不是
No.

443
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,550
昨晚是因为我今天要坐飞机走了

444
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,280
我可能再也见不到你了
and I'll probably never see you again.

445
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,590
何乐不为呢
Why not?

446
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,060
西雅图经常下雨  你知道吧
You know it rains a lot in Seattle, right?

447
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,440
你今天跟我去纪念馆吗
Are you gonna come with me to the memorial today?

448
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,350
我一定要去吗
Do I need to be there?

449
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,340
不
No.

450
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,050
我现在忙死了
I'm buried right now.

451
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:20,180
好吧
Fine.

452
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,340
汤姆·耶茨最近怎么总在这儿晃
Why has Tom Yates been hanging around so much?

453
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,080
他要给总统写书吗
Is he writing a book on the president?

454
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,260
我们都问过  他不肯说
We've all asked him and he won't say.

455
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,670
如果真是可很大胆
Ballsy move if it's true.

456
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,990
嗯  我受不了他的文笔
Yeah. I can't stand his writing.

457
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,560
你傻逼吗
Are you an idiot?

458
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,600
有看法就傻逼了
I'm an idiot for having an opinion?

459
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,430
有什么可"看法"的  他文笔多棒
There's no opinions to be had. His writing is gorgeous.

460
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,490
我的看法就是  我不觉得
Well, in my opinion, it isn't.

461
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,060
自己购物单都写不好还说别人
Said the guy who can't write a grocery list.

462
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,900
就等您了  先生
Ready whenever you are, sir.

463
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,190
今天是《社会保险法案》的80周年纪念日
Today marks the 80th Anniversary of the Social Security Act.

464
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,990
它的存在时间  甚至超过了不少其受益人
It has survived longer than many of its beneficiaries.

465
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,580
希望所有人都能活到它这个岁数
We should all be so lucky to live as long as it has.

466
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,270
但当人活到80
But by the time the human body has circled the sun 80 times,

467
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,440
青春和活力就已不再
its youth and vigor are gone.

468
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,990
关节疼  骨头变脆  肌肉退化
Joints ache, bones and muscles are weaker,

469
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,720
心脏的跳动也不如从前强健了
the heart doesn't beat with the same power it once did.

470
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,740
我们所有人都最终得面对这一事实
All of us must face this truth eventually.

471
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,560
到那时  我们就得把接力棒交给下一代
And when we do, we must hand the baton to the young.

472
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,470
那些等我们离世后
To those who have the strength

473
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,260
有力量继续我们事业的人
to carry on our work when we are gone.

474
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,280
这一点也是事实  社会保险在崩溃
Here's another truth: Social Security is dying.

475
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,190
如今  值其80岁之际  它必须向
Now in its 80th year, it must give way

476
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,170
一个更年轻  更有力的新未来计划让位
to a new, younger, stronger plan for the future.

477
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,000
这就是《美国就业法案》
That plan is America Works.

478
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,690
光是在华盛顿特区  我们就将失业率
In Washington DC alone, we've managed to reduce unemployment

479
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,470
削减了超过三分之一  2.5万人找到了工作
by over a third and put 25,000 people to work.

480
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,310
如果我们能在这么短的时间里
If we can accomplish so much

481
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,900
在华盛顿做出这么大的成就
in so little time here in Washington,

482
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,330
想象一下如果国会在全国范围内
imagine what we could accomplish

483
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,330
为《美国就业法案》提供资金
if Congress funded America Works

484
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,730
又将取得多大成就
nationwide.

485
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,150
那就不是几万份工作了
We wouldn't be talking about thousands of jobs.

486
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,450
而是数百万
We'd be talking about millions.

487
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,480
今天下午晚些时候
Later this afternoon,

488
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,180
我会前往罗斯福纪念馆  向那个80年前
I will visit FDR's memorial to pay my respects to the man

489
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,920
推行了《社会保险法案》的人致敬
who ushered in Social Security 80 years ago.

490
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,050
我们致敬先人留给我们如今的世界
We honor the dead for giving us the world we inherited.

491
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,640
但我们也得认识到
However, we must recognize

492
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,540
如果让先人管束我们  就只有死路一条
we are doomed if we allow the dead to govern us.

493
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,730
谢谢  天佑美利坚合众国
Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.

494
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,820
华盛顿NBC新闻
From NBC News in Washington,

495
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,300
这里是《恰克·托德新闻访谈》
this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.

496
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,550
早上好  欢迎收看《新闻访谈》
Good morning and welcome to Meet the Press.

497
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,640
我身边是亨特利和格里尔议员
I have with me Congresswoman Huntley and Congressman Greer.

498
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,130
议员女士  我先问您吧
Congresswoman, let me start with you.

499
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,960
总统今日在无线电讲话中
In the President's radio address today,

500
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,270
称华盛顿的案例是全国的榜样
he said the model here in Washington is a model for the nation.

501
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,180
您赞同吗
Do you agree?

502
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,760
是的  恰克
I do, Chuck.

503
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,440
我起初持怀疑态度
I was skeptical at first.

504
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,890
我父母都是社会保险的受益人
Both my parents benefited from Social Security.

505
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,580
我自己也一直指望它
And I've always counted on it for myself.

506
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,920
但当我想到我的孩子  孙辈
But, when I think about my kids, and my grandkids--

507
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,060
丽贝卡提出了一个好观点  几十年来
Rebecca raises a good point, one that we've been making

508
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,880
我们在共和党内一直在提出这个问题
in the Republican Party for decades.

509
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,430
但是  您虽然支持《美国就业法案》
And yet, while you support America Works,

510
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,460
贵党党内大多持反对态度
most members of your party do not.

511
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,160
恰克  我向来不怎么喜欢弗兰克·安德伍德
Chuck, I've never been a big fan of Frank Underwood.

512
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,080
但我华盛顿的家附近的公园从未像如今这么干净
But the park near my house here in Washington has never been cleaner.

513
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,280
我光顾的干洗店本月雇了两名新员工
The dry cleaners I go to just hired two new people this month.

514
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,230
我送孩子去的日托所的员工翻了倍
The daycare I drop my kids off at doubled their staff

515
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,770
这样每个孩子受到的个性化关注更多了
so the children can get more individual attention.

516
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,860
总统拿联邦应急管理署的钱或许是过分了
The president may have overstepped in taking FEMA money,

517
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,150
但成功就是成功  《美国就业法案》成功了
but when something works, it works. And America Works works.

518
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,960
你好
Hello.

519
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,390
给他们钱
Promise the money.

520
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,820
用一切手段让他回心转意
Whatever you need to turn him around.

521
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,210
我会批准从国际开发署拨款
I'll approve the USAID funds.

522
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,460
你为什么改主意了
What made you change your mind?

523
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,150
今天  在纪念馆
Today... at the memorial.

524
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,020
你知道最触动我的是什么吗
You know what struck me the most?

525
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,510
埃莉诺
Eleanor.

526
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,640
她一个人在旁边
She was off by herself.

527
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,560
孤身一人
Alone.

528
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,910
富兰克林也是  一个人
And so was Franklin. He was alone.

529
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,310
他们之间隔着墙
And there was a wall between them.

530
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,980
那些僧人
The monks.

531
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,950
他们来几周了  我们从没谈起过他们
They've been here for weeks. We haven't even discussed them once.

532
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,090
很美妙吧  他们的作品
It's beautiful, isn't it? What they're doing?

533
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,940
是啊
It is.

534
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,330
弗兰西斯  我今天看他们看了一个多小时
Francis, I watched them for over an hour today.

535
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,200
我一直在想着
And all I was thinking was,

536
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,620
我们为什么没有一起分享此刻
why aren't you and I sharing this together?

537
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,810
我们得想想办法  克莱尔
We have to do something, Claire.

538
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,880
我知道
I know.

539
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,460
你想怎么弄
What are you thinking?

540
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,790
我本来的发色  像我初识弗兰西斯时那样
My natural color. Like when I first met Francis.

541
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,500
-这个吗  -对
- This color? - Yes. Exactly.

542
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,550
好  请坐
Okay. Have a seat.

543
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,930
我想再修修袖子
I want to take up the sleeves a touch.

544
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,340
我觉得很好了  谢谢
Oh, I think they're perfect. Thank you.

545
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,410
-怎么样  -真美
- What do you think? - Beautiful.

546
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,560
我们今天聚集于此
We have gathered today

547
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,150
重证弗兰西斯·J·安德伍德
to renew the vows between Francis J. Underwood

548
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,200
和克莱尔·黑尔·安德伍德的婚誓
and Claire Hale Underwood.

549
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,180
就在这座教堂
It was here, in this church,

550
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,810
28年前  在上帝面前
28 years ago, before God,

551
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,360
你们二人首次向对方许下了誓言
that you two first committed yourselves to one another.

552
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,250
愿这再次确认的承诺  能加深你们的爱情
May this renewed commitment deepen your love for each other,

553
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,960
让你们的婚姻更加坚固  直到永远
and strengthen your eternal bond.

554
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,440
克莱尔的父亲给我们买下了这栋房子
Claire's father bought us this house.

555
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,890
我本想自己出钱  这事一直让我介意
I wanted to pay for it myself. That's always bothered me.

556
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,960
你不介意他为你首次竞选出资吗
You weren't bothered to let him pay for your first campaign?

557
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,280
那是政治  不一样
Well, that's politics. It's different.

558
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,140
筹钱要上天入地
You take money wherever you can get it.

559
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,590
这是我们第一个家
No, this was our first home.

560
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,670
-是个快乐的家吗  -拜托
- Was it a happy home? - Oh, please.

561
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,120
我以为你带我来
I thought you brought me here

562
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,130
就是想不再扯谎了
because we were gonna cut through the bullshit.

563
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,400
这本书要写的是《美国就业法案》
This book is supposed to be about America Works.

564
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,560
你必须作为书的核心  否则无法成书
There is no book without you at the center of it.

565
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,690
你信任我吗  还是不信任
Do you trust me? Or don't you?

566
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,030
你如果不信任我  就另找人写吧
Because if you don't, get someone else to write it.

567
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,850
或者你自己写
Or write it yourself.

568
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,200
你不知道过日子
You don't know what it's like

569
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,440
还得随时小心翼翼是什么滋味
to go through life looking over your shoulder.

570
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,720
背负没人能理解的秘密
Having secrets no one would understand.

571
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,260
我第一本书不是自己写的
I didn't write my first book.

572
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,830
我的朋友
My friend.

573
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,100
死掉的那个
The one who died.

574
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,320
是他写的
He wrote it?

575
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,060
前半部分  只给我一人看了
The first half. He didn't show it to anyone except me.

576
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,630
在医院时  他求我销毁书稿
In the hospital, he asked me destroy it.

577
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,160
我告诉他我会的
I told him I would.

578
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,140
但他写得太好
It was too good.

579
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,530
该写完  我就给写完了
It needed to be finished. So I finished it.

580
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,840
并说是你独立创作
And took all the credit.

581
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,560
是啊  是我写的结局
Oh, yeah. It's my part, the ending.

582
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,840
才是人们记住的部分
That's what people remember.

583
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,120
但那本书
But the book...

584
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,050
我整个职业生涯
My entire career...

585
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,400
都是基于一个谎言
It's all based on a lie.

586
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,200
秘密不是你一个人的专属
You don't have a monopoly on secrets.

587
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,650
这里地下埋了郁金香
There's tulips buried under here.

588
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,910
克莱尔种的
Claire planted them.

589
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,130
我一直
I've always...

590
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,580
从最开始
from day one...

591
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,490
就对她答应我的求婚感到羞耻
been ashamed she said yes when I asked her to marry me.

592
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,630
为什么
Why?

593
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,100
我觉得我配不上她
I didn't think I deserved her.

594
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,510
但我告诉你
I can tell you this, though,

595
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,440
如果不是克莱尔  我就不能入主白宫
there would have been no White House without Claire.

596
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,720
遇见她成就了更好的我
I was half the man before I met her.

597
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,330
但是  我很自私
But still, I've been selfish...

598
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,560
那样向她索取
feeding off her the way I have.

599
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,070
她清楚自己选择了什么
She knew what she was getting into.

600
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,390
或许吧  她比我更了解我
Probably. She knows me better than I know myself.

601
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:47,830
先生  我们计划是6点15分起航
Sir? We're scheduled to fly out at 6:15.

602
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,330
再过几分钟就得动身了
Should probably leave in the next few minutes.

603
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,390
谢谢  密查姆
Thank you, Meechum.

604
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,330
写吧
Scribble away.

605
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,450
他在房子前跟你说什么了
So, what'd he tell you in front of the house?

606
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,730
没什么
Nothing much.

607
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,010
不管是什么  似乎挺动情
Well, it looked intense, whatever it was.

608
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,840
瞧  这就是我不坐大车的原因
See? This is why I don't ride in the van.

609
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,810
这次不是坐了
You did this time.

610
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,370
有时候得让人静静
Sometimes you just need to leave someone alone.

611
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,700
好吧  我懂了
All right, I got the hint.

612
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,540
我是说他  不是我自己
I meant him. Not me.

613
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,600
他们哪去了
Where are they?

614
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,650
-谁  -那些僧人
- Who? - The monks.

615
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,620
他们今天早些时候做完了  先生
Oh, they finished earlier today, sir.

616
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,070
没了吗
So it's gone?

617
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,640
是的
I believe so.

618
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,610
我都没来得及看到
I didn't get a chance to see it.

619
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,480
他们应该拍过照
I'm sure they took a photo.

620
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,380
你能叫人给我弄一份吗
Will you ask someone to get me a copy?

621
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:22,810
这就去  先生
Right away, sir.

622
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,410
克莱尔  我差点没认出来
Claire. I almost didn't recognize you.

623
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,140
是啊  我决定该做点改变了
Yes, I decided it was time for a change.

624
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,720
很迷人啊
It's very fetching.

625
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,840
希望您不介意我不请自来
I hope you don't mind me crashing your party.

626
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,880
当然不  我的手下说你不在市里
Oh, of course not. My staff said you'd be out of town.

627
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,220
介意我跟卡斯皮大使单独谈谈吗
Would you mind if I borrowed Ambassador Caspi for a moment?

628
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,160
请吧
Of course.

629
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,830
你躲了我三周
You've been avoiding me for three weeks.

630
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,420
我去了耶路撒冷
I had a trip to Jerusalem.

631
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,450
你答应给津巴布韦三千五百万
You promised Zimbabwe 35 million

632
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,250
让他们提出会坏事的无理条款
so they'd introduce the poison pill amendment.

633
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,550
-只是出于人道主义考虑  -不是的
- For purely humanitarian reasons. - No.

634
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,160
这是你们第一次给津巴布韦援助
This is the first time you've ever sent aid to Zimbabwe.

635
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,400
别乱牵线
Don't draw connections that don't exist.

636
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,610
我们绝不会给决议案搞破坏
We would never try to sabotage the resolution.

637
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,060
美国是我们的盟友
The United States is our ally.

638
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,000
是啊  我们是
That's right, we are.

639
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,780
那就有点盟友的样子
So act like it.

640
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,200
什么
Excuse me?

641
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,410
我丈夫已经正式批准
My husband formally approved

642
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,620
向津巴布韦提供八千万人道主义援助金
our own humanitarian package for eighty million.

643
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,190
他们明天就将撤回条款
Zimbabwe will be withdrawing the amendment tomorrow.

644
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,120
决议案进入投票时
And when the resolution goes to a vote,

645
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:39,190
希望以色列像个忠诚的盟友那样表示支持
I expect Israel to support it like the loyal ally she is.

646
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,780
而不是背信弃义
Not lie to us.

647
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,080
这可不是博取我们支持的方式
That's not the way to solicit our support.

648
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,230
我没想"博取"  我在要求
I'm not soliciting. I'm demanding.

649
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,280
我可怜你  克莱尔
I feel sorry for you, Claire.

650
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,640
你丈夫要你来说狠话
Your husband sends you to talk tough.

651
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,910
但等约旦河谷出了岔子
But as soon as things go wrong in the Jordan Valley,

652
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,170
他就会甩手不管  让以色列收拾烂摊子
he'll turn his back and leave Israel to clean up the mess.

653
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,810
他根本没这个实力
He doesn't have the muscle.

654
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,960
他没法让国会配合他
He can't even get Congress to work with him.

655
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,630
你羞辱佩特罗夫后都不能支持你
Or back you up after you call out Petrov.

656
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,410
他背叛了你  也会如此对我们
He turned his back on you just like he will on us.

657
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,040
我丈夫是我见过的最勇敢  最有决心的人
My husband is the bravest and most resolute man I know.

658
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:15,930
他的计划会成功的
He will succeed in this plan.

659
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,010
勇敢
Brave?

660
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,100
我在约旦河谷服过役
I served in Jordan Valley.

661
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:22,050
我国总统和外交部长也是  他呢
As did the President and the Foreign Minister. Has he?

662
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,390
你不过是举着枪  听命令
You held a gun and somebody told you where to stand.

663
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,750
别把这跟三军统帅的重担搞混
Don't confuse that with the burden the Commander in Chief faces.

664
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,040
弗兰西斯曾下令杀人
Francis has given the order to kill.

665
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,460
他曾下葬过他送入虎口的士兵
He's buried soldiers he's put into harm's way.

666
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,790
每一天  他承受的责任
And every day, he wakes up bearing responsibilities

667
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,670
都是你无法想象的
you can't possibly imagine.

668
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,400
如果你来承担  你会崩溃的
They would crush you if they fell on your shoulders.

669
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,610
你去告诉你的上级
So you talk to your superiors.

670
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,610
等明天条款撤销
And when the amendment is withdrawn tomorrow,

671
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:54,320
你必须支持决议案
you will commit to supporting the resolution.

673
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:53,590
