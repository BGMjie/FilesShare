of the great state of Arizona,

146
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,830
因为她在最近的初选中为我们树立了
for giving us all such a good example of voting centers

147
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,420
投票中心的好榜样
as used in their recent primary.

148
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,300
但我其实是在
But what I'm really doing

149
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,300
引诱五个关键州的州长
is seducing the governors of five key states.

150
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,070
新泽西  内华达  伊利诺伊
New Jersey, Nevada, Illinois,

151
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,420
俄亥俄和宾州
Ohio and Pennsylvania.

152
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,890
州长分别是哈克特  努涅兹  加里纳德
Messrs. Harcourt, Nuñez, Gallinard,

153
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,880
奥姆斯泰德  还有马修斯
Olmstead and Matthews.

154
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,000
你们还记得马修斯吧
You remember Matthews, don't you?

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,470
加勒特·沃克总统的前副总统
Former vice president to President Garrett Walker.

156
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,190
就是个眼光狭隘的偷笔毛贼
Nothing but a provincial and petty pen-stealer.

157
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,570
但我需要他
But I need him.

158
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,070
想赢得这次选举  我需要他们五个都支持我
I need all five on my side if I'm gonna win this election.

159
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,500
从以往来看  马修是我们已知的最大未知数
Matthews, in our history, he's the biggest known unknown.

160
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,340
我差点忘了  金童也来了
And I almost forgot. The boy wonder is here.

161
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,050
我不容小觑的对手
My worthy opponent.

162
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,830
他坐立不安  我却如鱼得水
Out of his element and stuck in mine.

163
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,170
但你看  在政治中声望[身高]决定一切
But, you see, in politics, stature is everything.

164
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,280
你也能看出来
And wouldn't you say that

165
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,340
小威·康越来越矮了[底气不足]Willy C is getting shorter by the minute?

166
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,730
总统提出的这些边境限制令
These border restrictions the president is proposing...

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,670
军队是否该执行它们  将军
should the military play a role in enforcing them, General?

168
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,110
我们应该退后一步
I think we need to take a step back

169
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,760
站在大局看国家安全的当务之急
and look at our national security priorities.

170
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,200
以及如何调动军队
And what constitutes appropriate deployment

171
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
才是合理合法的
of our serving men and women.

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,210
我们是退役军人
As veterans,

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,420
此事让康威州长和我尤其挂心
this issue is a personal one for Governor Conway and me.

174
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,920
-你和  -我再跟你说
- Would you and-- - I'll tell you something else.

175
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,900
州长不会亲口这么说
You won't hear this from the governor himself,

176
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,300
但在他的军旅生涯中
but his military career

177
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,070
非凡的勇敢行为不计其数
is distinguished by exceptional acts of bravery.

178
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,920
尤其是  让他获得
In particular, the incident for which

179
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,960
紫心勋章的那次行动  格外突出
he was awarded the Purple Heart stands out.

180
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,770
这表明了他能成为怎样的三军统帅
Speaks to the kind of commander in chief he will be.

181
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,930
也证明了在我看来  是无畏的智慧
Demonstrates what I call fearless wisdom.

182
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,770
美国应该尽早听听他立功的来龙去脉
Someday soon, America needs to hear the full story of that day.

183
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,970
感谢您的参与  布洛哈特将军
Thank you for your time, General Brockhart.

184
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,330
很高兴接受采访
Glad to talk to you.

185
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,470
接下的《特别报道》  我们将关注
Coming up next on Special Report, we take a look at...

186
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,400
我对天发誓  要是安德伍德往边境派兵
I swear to God, if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,

187
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,640
我第一个站出来让军人抗命
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.

188
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,530
在拨款分配方面
In terms of allocation of funds,

189
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,920
水源问题让我整夜发愁
it's our water supply that keeps me up at night.

190
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,920
罗杰  你是说保护基础设施吗
Roger, are you talking about protecting the infrastructure?

191
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,580
基础设施还有水源问题
Infrastructure and water sources.

192
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,900
水库  水坝  还有输水管道系统
Reservoirs, the dams, the tunnel delivery systems--

193
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,080
所有这些  是的
All of it, yes.

194
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,390
保护它们免遭恐袭  当然
Protection from terrorism, sure,

195
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,790
但选民们还看到了更大的危险
but the voters see even greater dangers.

196
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,700
建设性的  环境方面的  藻类毒素
Structural, environmental, toxins from algae.

197
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,170
水藻是我们的大麻烦
Algae's quite a problem for us.

198
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,520
关键问题是  联邦政府尽力了吗
The big question here, are the feds doing all they can do?

199
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,030
联邦政府还想做更多事情
Well, the feds want to do even more.

200
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,210
那就是我们今天聚在这里的原因
That's the reason that we're all meeting here today.

201
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,480
先生们  我现在看到的
Now, look, gentlemen, all I can see

202
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,400
是我们大家都在争吵
is that we're in violent agreement with each other.

203
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,550
罗杰  我们认识多久了
I mean, Roger, how long have we known each other?

204
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,880
多长时间了
How far do we go back?

205
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,290
我还有头发的时候你就认识我了  总统先生
You knew me when I had hair, Mr. President.

206
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,810
但不管怎样  我的选民都说
It doesn't change the fact that my constituents are saying,

207
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,380
"我们需要的是桥  不是战区"
"Give me a bridge, not a war zone."

208
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,460
我的意思是
All I'm saying is that

209
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,510
我们要及时预测并扼制威胁
we need to anticipate threats when we can and thwart them.

210
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,480
我的意思是  大选将至
I'm saying that we're days away from an election,

211
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,310
我不想把事情搞砸
and I don't wanna upset the apple cart.

212
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,980
抱歉我离开一下
Excuse me for just a moment.

213
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,130
威尔  你看到这个了吗
Will, have you seen this?

214
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,320
好  我回头找他
All right. I'll deal with him later.

215
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,690
告诉我她具体说了什么
Tell me exactly what she said.

216
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,470
只说她是从肯·卡斯维尔那里听到的
Just that she heard it from Ken Caswell.

217
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,800
我向萨里达当局核实过了  先生
I checked with the local authorities in Salida, sir.

218
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,630
不太妙
It doesn't look good.

219
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
-可能性  -加强搜索力度
- The chances of-- - Amp up the search.

220
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
无论他们是需要物资还是人手
Whatever materials and personnel they need

221
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,410
除了他们已经有的  都给他们
in addition to what they have, give them.

222
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,930
再联系一下贝丝·科贝特  我想和她通话
And reach out to Beth Corbet. I'd like to speak to her directly.

223
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,900
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

224
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,740
从2012年起我就没睡过一个好觉
I haven't slept a good night's sleep since 2012.

225
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,230
但我觉得当选官员不睡觉的话
But I guess elected officials don't sleep

226
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,390
我们的选民就能睡好了
so our constituents can.

227
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,150
成功打击恐怖活动的证据
The proof of success in fighting terror...

228
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,520
就是民众对此毫不知晓
is something the public never hears about.

229
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,640
我州的一座城市
A certain city in my state

230
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,600
是国内最大的恐袭目标
wears the biggest target in the nation.

231
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,740
纽约州和纽约市
The city and state of New York...

232
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,950
十五年来默默地胜利着
has scored silent wins for 15 years...

233
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,260
从未宣战
without a declaration of war.

234
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,970
好吧
Now...

235
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,410
大多数时候
in most cases...

236
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,000
我会说各州可以进行自我管理
I would argue the states can take care of themselves.

237
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,310
总统先生  
Mr. President!

238
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,490
没事  继续  州长
Well, by all means, continue, Governor.

239
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,160
你之前在说什么  失眠
What... what was that part you were talking about? Insomnia?

240
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
我的意思是
My point is,

241
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,260
在座各位都是美国人  我们都爱这个国家
we're all Americans in this room, and we all love this country.

242
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,730
我想感谢总统
and I'd like to thank the president

243
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,080
给我机会讨论这一非常重要的话题
for the opportunity to discuss this very important topic,

244
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,060
我很抱歉  我的时间太紧张
and apologize for, uh, being on such a tight schedule.

245
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,960
我们非常感谢
Well, we are enormously grateful

246
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,220
今天州长能抽出时间赶来参加
that the governor took the time to come and join us today.

247
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,690
我只是想弄明白
I'm just trying to understand.

248
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,980
克莱尔  如果我的话冒犯到了你
Claire, if I said anything to offend you,

249
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,870
那完全是
it was entirely...

250
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,780
你懂我的  我说话不动脑子
I mean, you know me. No filter.

251
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,760
那就是让我担心的事
And that's what worries me.

252
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,380
我只是凭直觉行事  肯
I'm just operating on instinct, Ken.

253
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,630
你来这儿是有什么目的吗
Did you come down here with an agenda?

254
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,590
没有  我...
No. I mean...

255
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,440
我一直想找弗兰克  但今天只是...
I have been trying to reach Frank, but today was just...

256
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,580
我看到你要出席一场活动
I saw that you were appearing at an event

257
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,340
就来打个招呼
and I showed up to say hi.

258
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,570
我真的在这附近工作
I... I really do work around here,

259
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,560
在一条叫"华尔"的街上  知道吗
on a street called "Wall", you know?

260
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,960
但你提到了
But then you made reference

261
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,750
两个非常亲密的朋友的事
to something about two very close friends

262
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,400
这不关任何人的事  包括你
that's nobody's business, including yours.

263
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,170
你自己也这么说
And you even said so yourself,

264
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,380
肯  你是个大嘴巴
Ken, that you have an awfully big mouth.

265
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,540
我
I...

266
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,920
我失去了一位好友
I lost a dear friend.

267
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,890
我爱蒂姆  大家都爱他
I loved Tim. Everybody did.

268
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,510
你还特别暗指了弗兰西斯
And you implied Francis especially.

269
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,470
是的  我是说  那完全是另一回事
Well, yeah. I mean... That was a whole other thing.

270
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,760
怎么是另一回事
In what way?

271
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,020
就是...你想让我说什么
In... What do you want me to say?

272
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,390
我相信我知道的并不比你多
I'm sure I don't know anything you don't.

273
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,620
我只是很想知道你是怎么想的
I'm just very interested in your perspective.

274
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,630
弗兰克很敬重蒂姆  他愿为他做任何事
Frank worshipped Tim, would have done anything for him.

275
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,070
我说不好
I don't know.

276
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,730
如果当时的世道是另一番样子  谁知道呢
If the world were a different place back then... who knows?

277
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,170
那是很久之前的事了  后来他遇见了你
That was a long time ago. And then he met you.

278
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,360
他真有福气
And lucky him.

279
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,560
瞧  要说我的公司
Look, in terms of my firm and...

280
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,980
和我联系总统那么费劲...
and trying to get the president's ear...

281
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,600
这的确有点尴尬
I mean, yeah, it's a little embarrassing

282
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,350
跟我有30多年交情的老朋友
that my friend of 30-whatever years

283
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,240
没有时间接我的电话
didn't have time to pick up the phone.

284
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,730
他应该回你电话的
He should have called you back.

285
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,580
弗兰西斯和蒂姆是非常要好的朋友
Francis and Tim were very good friends.

286
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,620
但是  肯  随着年龄的增长
But, you know, Ken, the older I get,

287
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,430
我发现妄下判断是很危险的
I learn that assumptions are dangerous.

288
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,110
是啊  好吧
Sure. Okay.

289
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,940
很高兴见到你
It was great to see you.

290
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,060
她在哪
So where is she?

291
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,130
计划有变  她需要留在纽约
Change of plans. She needed to stay in New York.

292
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,920
她要我为这次会议做了准备的
She asked me to put something together for this.

293
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,320
是吗  临时有事
Yeah? Well, something came up.

294
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,270
副总统会替她出席
The vice president will be filling in for her.

295
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,730
我的天...
Oh, my...

296
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,840
你好啊
Hey, man.

297
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,300
我们以前组过一个很糟糕的乐队
Uh, we played in a terrible band together back in the day.

298
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,130
我们那时还年少  不需要付赡养费
Before adulthood and alimony came crashing down.

299
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,380
两个前妻吗
Two exes?

300
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,490
第一夫人在哪
So, uh, where's the First Lady?

301
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,960
临时有事
Something came up.

302
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,110
我想问你几个关于为竞选工作的问题
I'd love to ask you a few questions about working on the campaign.

303
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,230
我只是个讲稿撰写人
I'm just a speechwriter.

304
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,210
是啊  你怎么得到这份工作的
Exactly. How the hell did that happen?

305
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,560
欢迎来到对外关系委员会
Welcome to the Council on Foreign Relations

306
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,770
此次特别活动  跨越国境:前进的道路
and this special event on Crossing Borders: The Way Forward.

307
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,500
这好像是个摇摆州派对
I smell a swing state party.

308
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,590
注意语气  瑞克
Tone, Rick.

309
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,460
你不必大费周章召集数十位州长
You didn't have to round up dozens of governors

310
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,110
只为跟我们五个谈话
just to talk to the five of us.

311
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,990
你们来这里是因为我们在担心
You're here because there have been concerning threats

312
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,350
你们各州的远郊郡存在威胁
in exurban counties in each of your states.

313
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,000
你能再说具体一点吗
Could you be more specific?

314
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,530
我们在关注亨特顿  埃尔科  杰弗逊郡
We're keeping an eye on Hunterdon, Elko, Jefferson counties.

315
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,100
还有切斯特和麦克亨利
Also Chester and McHenry.

316
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,860
所以在大选来临前
Which is why it's crucial

317
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,410
我们必须要与你们各州的
that we work with your states' administrations

318
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,000
州政府合作
leading up to the election.

319
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,710
这些选区
Every one of those precincts

320
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,200
都是典型的共和党票仓
is a typically Republican stronghold.

321
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,470
这和党派关系无关
This isn't about party affiliation.

322
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,360
如总统所说  这事关国家安全
As the president said, this is about security.

323
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,640
我们相信这些举措
Now, we believe this course of action,

324
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,110
对投票站增加警力
the voting centers with the added law enforcement,

325
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,890
能充分保证
will give us everything that we need

326
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,460
选举的安全性
to protect the integrity of the ballot box.

327
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,490
好吧  但我代表
Okay, but speaking for

328
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,060
奥姆斯泰德州长  也许还有所有我们的上司
Governor Olmstead and maybe all of our bosses,

329
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,260
想问问  我们怎么知道这些措施
how can we be sure that these measures

330
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,900
不会让选民不敢去投票
won't discourage everyone from getting to the polls?

331
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,400
-比如  民主党人  -我们必须冒这个险
- I.E., Democrats. - It's a chance we have to take.

332
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,130
但我们认为不会出现这样的结果
But we don't believe it'll play out that way.

333
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,560
我们俄亥俄州的选票非常接近
We're in an extremely close race in Ohio.

334
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,300
重要的是预防可能的
Preventing further acts of terrorism

335
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
恐怖袭击  塔妮娅
is just about all that matters, Tanya.

336
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,770
我非常清楚  威胁的增加
Now, I do realize with these heightened threats

337
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,370
给了你们的州长额外的压力
comes an additional strain on the governors of your states.

338
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,460
所以...
So...

339
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,220
我要对你们所有人说...
I say to each and every one of you...

340
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,930
告诉我们该如何帮助你们
tell me how we can help.

341
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,430
抛开确实存在的道德问题不谈
Putting aside the very real moral questions,

342
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,050
封锁边境怎么能可行
how is shutting down the borders even feasible?

343
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,990
我知道这项政策会损害部分人的利益
I know this policy is going to hurt some people,

344
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,140
但容我解释一下为什么必须这样做
but let me explain why it's necessary.

345
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,820
副总统随时可以补充
And the vice president should feel free to jump in.

346
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,320
好玩吗
But is it fun?

347
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,160
为安德伍德找话说
Putting words in the Underwoods' mouths?

348
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,450
我的工作不是这样的
That's not what I do.

349
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,540
恰好相反
It's more like the opposite.

350
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,710
我只是尽量表达出...
I just try and articulate...

351
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,420
他们的想法和心声
what's on their minds and in their hearts.

352
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,180
你是这么看待你的工作的
That's how you see your job?

353
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,980
基本上  我的工作就是当个隐形人
Basically, my job is to remain invisible.

354
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,900
那晚上你和他们在一起吗
Were you with them that night?

355
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,370
吉姆·米勒被杀的那晚
The night Jim Miller was killed?

356
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,120
这我不能回答
I'm not gonna answer that.

357
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,720
那就当作默认
I'll take that as a "yes."

358
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,370
别这样
Don't.

359
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,640
我只是想了解你的工作
I'm just trying to understand what you do.

360
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,010
那你就弄错重点了
Then you're missing the point.

361
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,200
我不是主角  史蒂夫  我不是
I'm not the story, Steve. I'm just not.

362
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,040
你把自己说得可有可无
You make yourself sound replaceable.

363
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,100
事实如此
I am.

364
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,030
-我为总统效劳  -还有第一夫人
- I serve at the pleasure of the president. - And the First Lady?

365
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,600
民主党副总统候选人
The Democratic vice presidential candidate...

366
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,310
没错  还有她
Yeah. Her, too.

367
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,700
但你为他们俩撰写讲稿
But you write speeches for both of them?

368
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,740
更多是为安德伍德夫人写
Most often for Mrs. Underwood.

369
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,400
将她的想法和心声表达出来
Articulating what's on her mind and in her heart?

370
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,420
我只是个传声筒
I'm just a mouthpiece.

371
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,890
她有交给你其他"任务"吗
Has she put you in charge of any other parts?

372
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,760
你还是那么混账
You're still an asshole, man.

373
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,380
祝你赡养费的事好运
Good luck with the alimony.

374
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,850
-真够呛  -还算顺利吧
- That was rough. - It went fine.

375
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,890
这维系不下去的
It's not sustainable.

376
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,750
你的看法是什么
I mean, what do you think?

377
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,060
-什么的看法  -总统急于宣战之举
- About what? - About the president's rush to war.

378
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,760
华府至少有一半人都认为这太过分了
At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.

379
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,110
是很过分
It is outrageous.

380
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,310
我们可以辞职以表示抗议
We could resign our posts, you know, in protest.

381
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,650
我相信我们能说服其他内阁成员一起辞职
I bet we can convince others of the cabinet to do the same thing.

382
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,740
我是想说  目的就是要过分
Outrageous by design, I was going to say.

383
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,130
总统的做法很聪明
It's smart, what the president's doing.

384
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,760
-为他的民调加了分  -唐纳德
- It's serving him in the polls. - Donald.

385
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,020
我们先...退几步说话
Let's... take a step back for a moment.

386
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,360
我低估了你  真的
I underestimated you. I did.

387
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,160
你当代总统时  我对你信心不足
When you were acting president, my faith was less than full.

388
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,070
但现在我能理解你当时的困境和压力...
But now, I understand the terrible box you were in, the forces--

389
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,570
凯茜  我得...打断你
Cathy, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop you.

390
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,830
我真的不知道你在说些什么
I honestly don't know what you're talking about.

391
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,240
你是说你的计划是要
Are you telling me your plan

392
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,870
装作若无其事直到1月20日总统就职吗
is just to phone it in until January 20th?

393
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,450
唐纳德  你是怎么回事
Come on, Donald. What's happened to you?

394
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,880
想当初
Back in the day,

395
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,860
你和玛乔莉总是站在
you and Marjorie were at

396
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,070
所有进步革新的最前线
the forefront of every progressive cause,

397
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,930
真正地为善而战
literally fighting the good fight.

398
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,180
这些人
These people...

399
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,220
我们真要让他们这么做吗
Can we really let them do this?

400
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,500
你想缅怀往事  凯茜  好吧
You wanna walk down memory lane, Cathy? Okay.

401
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,520
记得党代会吗  记得政治新闻网那篇文章吗
Remember the convention? Remember the Politico article?

402
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,110
我给了你一条退路
I offered you an out.

403
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,030
你当时就该把握机会下台
You should've taken that opportunity to resign, then and there.

404
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,510
-当时的情况和现在不同  -没两样
- Circumstances were nothing like this. - Sure they were.

405
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,810
你当时只是不愿认清事实
You just didn't want to see it.

406
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,490
再告诉你一件事
And, just so you know,

407
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,940
在她完全失智前  玛乔莉就说准了
right before her mind was truly gone, Marjorie called it.

408
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,170
她看出了你和弗兰克·安德伍德的私下结盟
She saw the unholy alliance you were making with Frank Underwood.

409
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,370
她早就说准了
She called it.

410
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,100
今天我们俩上司的会面...
So this meeting between our bosses today...

411
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,350
总统期待
The president is looking forward to

412
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,360
与马修斯州长展开有成效的会谈
a productive discussion with Governor Matthews.

413
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,480
这里只有我们俩  咱就别说废话了
There's no one else here. Can we cut the crap?

414
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,980
你要我们刻意压制投票
You want us to engage in voter suppression.

415
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,040
我不会用那样的字眼
It's not a phrase I'd ever use.

416
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,600
随便你  那就称之为"降低动力"吧
Fine. Call it "motor depression" for all I care.

417
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,680
我们懂的  白人是问题所在
We get it. White people are the problem.

418
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,450
是共和党人  我懂
Republicans. Understood.

419
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,440
但我的上司并不参加再选
But my boss doesn't happen to be up for reelection.

420
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,230
我洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

421
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,000
我就说三个字  "熔渣堆"
I have two words for you. "Slag heap."

422
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,250
马修斯希望环保署把费城郊区
Matthews wants the EPA to name a slag heap

423
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,950
一座熔渣堆列为特别清污地点
on the outskirts of Philadelphia as a Superfund site.

424
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,130
我高度怀疑这在大选前能实现
I seriously doubt that can happen before the election.

425
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,210
你该克服自我怀疑  道格
I think you should battle your doubts, Doug.

426
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,480
州长愿意让过去成为往事
The governor is willing to let the past stay in the past.

427
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,140
但除非安德伍德政府
But unless the Underwood administration

428
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,380
备好了上等大礼
is bearing top-tier gifts,

429
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,760
你敢让前副总统帮忙
you've got a lot of fucking nerve

430
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,290
胆子还真是够大
asking for favors from the former VP.

431
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,280
但话说回来  如果你能把事情处理好
On the other hand, if you make things right,

432
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,870
马修斯会做好他该做的
Matthews will do his part.

433
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,220
你应该一向很同情那匹马吧
Don't you always feel sorry for the horse?

434
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,500
会议室里是谁
Who's in the conference room?

435
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,030
-你是说娘子军吗  -什么
- You mean the lady brigade? - What?

436
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,870
就是国安局的法庭审计员
That's what they call the NSA forensic auditors.

437
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,000
我不知道她们今天要来
Yeah, I... I didn't know they were scheduled for today.

438
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,850
她们总这样  就这么突然出现
That's their routine. They just show up.

439
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,950
国安局就这样
Welcome to the NSA.

440
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,530
哥们
Hey, boss.

441
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,450
我可以吃吗  总统先生
May I, Mr. President?

442
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,630
放着就是让人吃的
Well, that's what they're there for.

443
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,130
我不会占用你太多时间
I won't take up much of your time.

444
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,290
我知道你下午很忙
I know you have a busy afternoon.

445
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,100
-我还是有点时间的  -我很好奇
- Well, I've got a little time. - I'm curious.

446
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,250
为什么委员会先给你打电话
Why do you think the committee decided to call you first?

447
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,530
因为是我要求的
Because I asked them to.

448
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,180
突然要参加
Well, this emergency

449
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,240
你召开的紧急州长会议  所以...
governors' conference of yours came up and, uh...

450
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,790
你肯定记得  我不怎么喜欢特区
I'm sure you recall, I don't much like DC,

451
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,630
所以我想着何不就一次都搞定呢
so I figured why not make it one-stop shopping?

452
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,320
是啊
Yes.

453
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,620
不过我们都知道  行使总统特权
But, of course, we both know that executive privilege

454
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,760
就可以替你省一桩事的
could've negated your having to appear at one of those shops.

455
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,160
吉姆
Jim?

456
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,530
我会帮你解决熔渣堆的事
I'm going to help you with your slag heap.

457
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,180
希望这样一来我能指望上你
I hope that means that I can count on you.

458
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,520
当然了
Of course that's what it means.

459
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,320
我们是一个小型兄弟会的  都是前副总统
We're members of a tiny brotherhood, you and I, of ex-VPs.

460
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,200
如果加勒特·沃克去委员会作证
When, and if, Garrett Walker appears before this committee,

461
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,820
你觉得他会...
do you think he'll...

462
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,970
-背叛党派吗  -你是说背叛你吗
- betray the party? - You mean you?

463
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,210
两者是一回事
Well, that would be the same thing.

464
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,990
我不知道你接替了我副总统的职位
Now, I don't know what really happened

465
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,950
随后又接替了加勒特总统的职位过程中
on your journey to replace me as vice president

466
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,870
究竟发生了什么
and then Garrett as president.

467
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,560
我只知道自己的直觉
I only know what my gut tells me.

468
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,930
但我愿意无视我的直觉
But I'm willing to say fuck my gut.

469
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,260
总而言之
Bottom line is

470
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,930
我能帮你搞定委员会  也能伤害你
I can help you with this committee or I can hurt you.

471
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,690
我可以说我一无所知
Now, I can say that I know nothing...

472
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,190
我认为加勒特·沃克是个有困扰的人
and that what I saw in Garrett Walker was a troubled man.

473
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,740
我可以只说这些
And I can leave it at that.

474
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,340
你觉得呢
What do you think?

475
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
我不能告诉你该怎么做  吉姆
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, Jim.

476
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,480
但我可以说  我们副总统不说两家话
But I can say, as one ex-VP to another,

477
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,560
宾夕法尼亚州的清污工作
that this cleanup in Pennsylvania

478
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,320
价值三亿美元和一万个工作岗位
is gonna be worth about $300 million and 10,000 jobs.

479
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,200
一下午的辛劳能赚来这个不错了
And that's not bad for an afternoon's work.

480
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,660
我喜欢这条新地毯
I like the new rug.

481
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,590
谢谢  其实都不是我弄的
Oh, thank you. I didn't have much to do with it.

482
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,470
是克莱尔布置的
It was really Claire's design.

483
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,010
很高兴见到你  总统先生
Good to see you, Mr. President.

484
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,070
我也是
You, too.

485
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,580
斯坎伦州长
Governor Scanlon.

486
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,390
总统先生
Mr. President.

487
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,100
我一直挂记你
You've been on my mind.

488
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,030
我想跟你上司谈谈宣战委员会的事
I wanna talk to your boss about the Declaration of War Committee.

489
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,460
如果
So...

490
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,710
你是想拿欠缴税款的事来要挟他
if you're hoping to intimidate him because of the back taxes,

491
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,170
就别白费口舌了
you can save your breath.

492
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,220
事情都已经解决干净了
His closet is back to being clean.

493
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,580
那你的事呢
What about yours?

494
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,050
-你就是个畜生  -我可没看
- You're a pig. - Hey, I didn't watch it.

495
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,650
我只是传话的
I'm just the messenger.

496
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,910
-尽管去生发帖人的气吧  -生着呢
- Be mad at the dude who posted it. - I am.

497
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,740
有很多办法能解决这个
There are ways to get rid of it.

498
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,170
这是份善意的礼物  让你知道我是认真的
It's a goodwill gift. To let you know I'm serious.

499
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,380
我猜  早晚我会被传召
Look, I'm guessing, sooner or later, I get called.

500
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,270
如果真这样  我可以援引第五修正案的权利
And if that happens, I could plead the Fifth.

501
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,750
我也可以跟他们打一天太极
I could press-secretary them all day long.

502
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,040
但我希望还有别的选择
But I'd like to have another option on the table.

503
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,380
我自己不能做公开证人
Yeah, I can't be a public witness myself...

504
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,320
但你要是能给我提供匿名权和豁免权...
but if you offer me anonymity and immunity...

505
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,150
我可以私下作证
I can testify privately.

506
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,120
告诉委员会"尸体"埋在哪了
Tell the committee where the bodies are buried, so to speak.

507
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,770
我确认一下  你是说
But, just to be clear, you're telling me

508
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,680
你有证据证明总统参与了犯罪活动
you have evidence the president engaged in criminal activity?

509
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,210
不是涉及总统的证据  不
Not evidence regarding the president, no.

510
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,360
我有很多关于他的幕僚长的料
I have a lot of information about his chief of staff.

511
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,720
道格·斯坦普

512
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,350
跟你老板谈谈  告诉我结果
Talk to your boss. Let me know.

513
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,330
布莉姬特  说句题外话
Uh, Bridget, total non sequitur...

514
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,090
你的脖子真美
You have a very elegant neck.

515
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,050
格雷森先生吗
Mr. Grayson?

516
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,010
我叫肖恩·杰弗瑞斯  《先驱报》的
Sean Jeffries. I'm with the Herald.

517
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,410
抱歉  没办法跟你握手
Sorry, I don't have a free hand.

518
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,850
你在报社待多久了
How long have you been with the paper?

519
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,480
13个月  时尚专栏的
Thirteen months. Style section.

520
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,980
难怪我不认识你
Oh, that would explain why I don't know you.

521
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,020
男人的领带是心灵的窗户  
Man's tie is a window into his soul.

522
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,520
我们刚发了一篇相关文章
We just ran a piece on it.

523
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,310
是吗  那从我的领带能怎么解读我
Oh, yeah? So, uh, what does my tie say about me?

524
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,910
你是个呕心沥血的公仆
It says you're a dedicated civil servant

525
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,480
有银行账户可以证明
with the bank account to prove it.

526
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,540
总之  正好认出你了  顺便打个招呼
Anyway, recognized you, just wanted to say hi.

527
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,220
当然  除非还能请你喝一杯
I mean, unless we can buy you a drink.

528
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,340
你认识卡姆·劳德吗    
You know, uh, Cam Lawder?

529
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,540
梅赛德斯奔驰的说客
Lobbyist for Mercedes-Benz?

530
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,850
他旁边是金·菲尔舒克  国防部的
Next to him is, uh, Kim Feldshuk, works at the DOD.

531
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,710
那个是兰迪·博福德
And that's Randy Beauford.

532
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,360
华盛顿死胖子们的私人教练

533
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,820
今天下午我们走复古风
We're going old school this afternoon.

534
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,840
来吧  跟我们一起喝一杯
Come on, join us for a quick one.

535
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,740
"传声筒"
"Mouthpiece"?

536
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,940
我都不知道他干吗要接受采访
I don't know why he was talking to the press in the first place.

537
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,670
毫无疑问  汤姆选这么个词真是不慎
An unfortunate choice of word for Tom, no doubt.

538
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,450
不过  热度会很快过去的
But still, it'll play itself out.

539
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,450
但我想知道的是  你看出了什么
But what I want to know is, what do you see?

540
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,950
你为什么不喜欢耶茨
Why don't you like Yates?

541
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,580
汤姆是团队里很重要的一部分
Uh, Tom is an important part of the team.

542
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,610
他的演讲一直
His speeches have been--

543
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,910
听着  他的责任远不止如此
Oh, look. He has more responsibilities than that.

544
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,340
你知道的  所以你不高兴
You know it. So that bothers you.

545
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,660
我只是不希望
I... just wouldn't want

546
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,540
有任何人进行对竞选无用的
anyone to infer a personal investment on his part

547
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,800
个人投资
that isn't useful to the campaign.

548
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,040
我只是想表达
I suppose all I'm saying is that

549
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,480
我不会让第一夫人
I won't let anything happen

550
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,230
或总统先生您出任何事
to the First Lady or you, Mr. President.

551
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,140
我很感激  莉安
I appreciate that, LeAnn.

552
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,770
我们完了  总统先生  原谅我爆粗口
We are fucked, Mr. President. Pardon my French.

553
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,350
我不关心你的粗口  你到底来干什么
I don't care about your French. Why am I even talking to you?

554
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,090
国安局派了审计员来
Well, the NSA has sent in auditors.

555
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,360
要是我不抹去我的档案  掩盖我的行踪
If I don't erase my files, cover my tracks--

556
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,080
我们离选举只有一周了  麦卡伦先生
We're a week away from the election, Mr. Macallan.

557
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,790
-掩盖好你的行踪  -好  这样的话
- Cover your tracks. - Okay. In which case,

558
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,520
我得让黑客们暂时
I need to let hackers temporarily

559
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,860
侵入东首都电信的一处转接中心
invade a Capital East Telecom switching center.

560
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,970
什么意思
Meaning what?

561
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,740
中心承担了大部分美国政府的网络流量
Well, the center covers most of the US government cyber traffic.

562
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,610
但我如果登入  并在20分钟内登出
But if I'm in and out in 20 minutes,

563
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,430
我想损害看上去也就是恶作剧级别的
I think the damage will look mischief-level.

564
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,000
连接故障之类的
Messed-up connections, that sort of thing.

565
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,550
-要是20分钟没出来呢  -不会的
- What if it takes you longer? - Uh, it won't,

566
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,640
因为再有十几二十分钟...
because another ten, 20 minutes and...

567
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,810
做吧
Do it.

568
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,220
好  我会在下午四点开始
All right. Well, I'll start it at 4:00 p.m.

569
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,490
我一弄完
Uh, as soon as I'm done,

570
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,400
就匿名发送一份修复代码
I'll anonymously send out a fix to the problem.

571
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,290
-不  -先生
- No. - Sir?

572
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,640
莉安会通知你什么时候发送修复
LeAnn will contact you about when to send out the fix.

573
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,030
-你要等她的消息  -好  不过以防...
- You'll wait for her. - Okay, but just to be--

574
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,280
她会通知你的
She'll let you know.

575
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,710
我刚看了那篇海恩斯的文章
I just saw the Haines article.

576
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,350
我完全不知道汤姆怎么想的
I have no idea what Tom was thinking.

577
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,880
是啊
Yes.

578
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,330
太大意了
It was sloppy.

579
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,050
是啊  我会跟他谈的
Agreed. I'll talk to him.

580
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,200
你还好吗
Are you all right?

581
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,730
纽约怎么样
How was New York?

582
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,860
我的活动进展顺利
My events went well.

583
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,360
然后呢  你有什么没告诉我的
And? What aren't you telling me?

584
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,280
我遇见肯·卡斯维尔了
I bumped into Ken Caswell.

585
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,400
-他还知道什么情况吗  -不
- Does he know any more? - No, um...

586
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,210
-你为什么没回他电话  -什么
- Why didn't you call him back? - What?

587
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,720
他财政部的事  监督立法
His Treasury business. The oversight legislation.

588
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
我明白你不在乎这个  无所谓
I understand you don't care about it. Fine.

589
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,340
但你不能无视遗患  你应该听他说说
But you can't ignore loose ends like that. You owed him your ear.

590
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,990
我没想到这事会那么伤感情
Well, I didn't realize it was gonna become so personal.

591
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,420
我可是美国总统
I am the President of the United States,

592
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,070
拜托  我有点忙啊
for Christ's sake. I'm a bit busy.

593
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,840
过往不是你一声令下就能消失  弗兰西斯
The past doesn't disappear on command, Francis.

594
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,220
哪怕是总统都不行
Not even for presidents.

595
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,030
他对你说什么了
What did he say to you?

596
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,090
肯有张大嘴巴
Ken's got a big mouth.

597
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,480
蒂姆的事我很遗憾  我很抱歉他不在了
I'm sorry about Tim. I'm sorry he's gone.

598
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,690
我知道你对他的感情
I know how you felt about him.

599
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,250
或者我能想象
Or, I can imagine.

600
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,720
听我说
Listen to me.

601
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,950
你知道我这辈子只真正爱过你一个人
You know you're the only person I've ever truly loved.

602
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,270
你知道的吧
You know that, right?

603
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,570
你听好
And listen.

604
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,570
有别的事就要发生了
Something else is about to happen.

605
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,950
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

606
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,950
信号不太好  还顺利吗
Reception is sketchy. Good trip?

607
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,830
我只是回来换衣服  马上就得回去找弗兰西斯
I just came back to get changed. I need to get back to Francis.

608
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,240
你生我气了吗
You mad at me?

609
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,360
你不应该那么说
You shouldn't have said that.

610
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,150
我知道  我知道我们需要小心
I know. I know we need to be careful.

611
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,010
我们可远远不止要小心
Careful is far too small a word for what we need to be.

612
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,450
好吧
Okay.

613
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,360
但是你就不累吗
But don't you get tired of

614
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,770
整天不止要小心
being far bigger than careful all the time?

615
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,060
-我不知道是怎么回事  -我也不知道
- I don't know what's going on. - Me neither.

616
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,610
看来是网络信号有干扰
Seems to be some kind of network disturbance.

617
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,910
我连不上服务器了
I lost connection on my server.

618
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,500
你知道我烦什么吗  第一夫人这个角色
You know what I'm tired of? This role. First Lady.

619
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,540
因为感觉一直不对劲
'Cause it's never felt right.

620
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,590
再过八天  我就是副总统了
It's only eight more days to the vice presidency.

621
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,850
-那我的角色是什么  -什么
- What's my role? - What?

622
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,790
话说我到底是你什么人  或者你是我什么人
What am I to you, anyway? Or you, to me?

623
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,270
你是我女朋友吗
I mean, are you my girlfriend?

624
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,860
等你当选了
And when you win...

625
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,110
那我是不是就成了  第一男友什么的
does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?

626
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,410
第一男宠
First Concubine?

627
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,700
那篇文章的事  我很抱歉
About that article... I'm sorry.

628
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,970
我讨厌道歉
I hate apologies.

629
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,830
对不起
I'm sorry.

630
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,860
我当时看你了  看你目睹那一幕
I looked over at you. I watched you watching.

631
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,390
-什么时候  -对你有任何影响吗
- When? - Did it even affect you?

632
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,200
斩首的画面
The beheading?

633
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,280
问这个干什么
Why would you ask that?

634
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,350
我根本不知道你在想什么
I had no sense of what you were thinking.

635
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,410
完全不知道
None.

636
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,340
我在想什么  我什么都没想
Of what I was thinking? I wasn't thinking.

637
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,900
我在想  "什么都别想"
I was thinking, "Don't think."

638
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,920
我再跟你说个别的事
And I'll tell you something else.

639
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,220
我可没说过我喜欢整天小心
I never said I like being careful.

640
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,030
-可恶  -怎么了
- God damn it. - What's wrong?

641
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,230
卫星定位显示我们还在白宫呢
The GPS thinks we're back at the White House.

642
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,250
你联系上竞选办公室了吗
Did you reach the campaign office?

643
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,940
正在打  总是没信号
Trying. I can't get a signal.

644
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,230
等等  来信号了
Oh, wait. Here we go.

645
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,750
这班飞机我绝不能错过
I can't miss this flight.

646
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,900
-正在接通  -太好了
- It's ringing. - Good.

647
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,390
-你看还需要多久  -又断了
- How long do you think? - Now it stopped.

648
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,950
高速上堵车了  我在尽力了
There's a pile-up on the highway. I'm doing the best I can.

649
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,180
喂
Hello?

650
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
喂
Hello!

651
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,270
塔妮娅  我拿你的手机试试
Tanya, let me try your phone.

652
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,630
我的手机也一样
I'm having the same issues.

653
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,380
你能联系上办公室吗
Can you get through to the office?

654
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,990
不行  州长  打不通
No, Governor, I can't.

655
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,870
加勒特是个好人
Garrett is a good man.

656
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,270
-他可靠吗  -当然了  罗梅洛先生
- A trustworthy man? - Absolutely, Mr. Romero.

657
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,410
他是那种
And is he the kind of man

658
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,310
会蓄意参与竞选资金欺诈的人吗
who would knowingly participate in campaign finance fraud?

659
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,470
我不这么认为  不会
I wouldn't say that, exactly. No.

660
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,330
你和安德伍德总统熟悉吗  先生
How well do you know President Underwood, sir?

661
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,360
我认识总统4年了
I've known the president four years.

662
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,710
是弗兰西斯·安德伍德
Isn't it a fact that it was Francis Underwood

663
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,700
而不是沃克总统最先建议你辞职的吧
and not President Walker who first suggested you should resign?

664
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,040
据我回忆  不是的
To the best of my recollection, no.

665
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,800
而且你身为总统竞选搭档收到的竞选经费
And isn't it true that the source of campaign funds you received

666
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,730
追根溯源  和一起从密苏里
as the president's running mate was connected to

667
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,920
波及到中国的贿赂案件有联系吧
a pay-for-play scheme that reached all the way from Missouri to China?

668
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,190
据我所知  不是的
To the best of my knowledge, no.

669
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,750
你们没通过雷蒙德·塔斯克的公司
Did you receive any campaign donations

670
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,370
克雷顿-维斯特收到任何竞选捐助吗
through Raymond Tusk's firm, Clayton West?

671
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,280
据我回忆  没有
Not to the best of my recollection.

672
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,250
你的回忆和了解
Do you think your recollection

673
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,430
会随着时间推移而变化吗
or knowledge will improve as the day goes on?

674
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,460
什么
Excuse me?

675
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,490
贝丝
Beth.

676
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,890
你要向我保证  无论有什么需要
I want you to promise me that you'll call me

677
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,830
都会打给我
anytime you need anything.

678
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,080
你是蒂姆的一生挚爱
You were the love of Tim's life, you know that.

679
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,710
我还是...
Well, I should probably...

680
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,210
对  你也是
Yes. You, too.

681
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,950
再见
Goodbye.

682
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,650
谢谢你  菲利克斯
Thank you, Felix.

683
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,860
需要我帮你点起来吗  总统先生
Uh, would you like me to prepare it for you, sir?

684
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,540
不用了  谢谢你
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

685
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,830
首先要问的问题是  进气口打开了吗
The first question to ask yourself... "Is the damper open?"

686
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,400
一定不要让自己被烟雾包围
Never allow yourself to be overcome with smoke.

687
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,330
火势要起来  必须要通气  所以火炉才有格栅
Conflagration relies on airflow. That's what the grate is for.

688
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,090
底下的灰一英寸就够了
Now, I like a one-inch base of ash.

689
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,230
确实有用  但是
It's helpful, but of course

690
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,810
他们清理得太频繁了
they clean up around here too soon to do that.

691
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,500
至于怎么摆放木材
Now, as for the architecture of the logs,

692
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,620
我建议倒置摆放
I prefer the upside-down method.

693
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,370
大块木材放在底下
Largest logs right along the base.

694
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,050
上面是中块的
Then medium-size logs after that.

695
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,770
小块的
Small logs.

696
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,220
最后  是引火木
And then finally, kindling...

697
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,520
和火绒
and tinder.

698
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,210
当然  家乡有枯了的棕榈叶  那个最理想
Now, of course, back home, dead palmetto fronds are ideal.

699
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,990
不过在华盛顿
But, of course, here in Washington,

700
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,200
手边有什么垃圾都得拿来用
we have to use whatever garbage we find lying around.

701
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:09,210
但如果利用不好手边...
But then, if a man cannot use what's right in...

702
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,060
该死  蒂姆
God damn it, Tim.

703
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,590
如果你不够聪明
If a man is not smart enough

704
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,190
利用不好手边的资源
to be able to use whatever is in front of him

705
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,110
办不成事
and still make it work...

706
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,780
那就是
well, then...

707
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,700
你自己无能了
that's just a failure of the imagination.

708
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,310
...就在这儿  我还想
...right here. And I'm thinking...

709
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,590
"等等  要告诉他吗"
"Wait, do I tell him? Do--"

710
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,620
我得接
Uh, I gotta take this.

711
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,420
你不能私下作证
Your testimony can't be private.

712
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,530
-真遗憾  -就告诉你一下
- I'm sorry to hear that. - Just wanted to let you know.

713
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,240
"快闪血警告"是什么
What's a "flash blood warning"?

714
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,880
大家的手机上都有
It's coming up on everybody's phones.

715
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,500
谢谢你们的酒
Thanks for the drinks.

716
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:23,600
汤姆  停下  我得回去了
Tom, stop. No. I... I have to get back.

717
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,670
别这样
Come on.

718
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,220
不行
No.

719
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,840
汤姆
Tom!

720
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,040
最后  划一下火柴
And, finally, you strike your match...

721
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,240
点燃引火木
you ignite your kindling...

722
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,930
然后吹气
and then you blow.

723
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,670
开始了  先生
It's happening, sir.

724
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,570
请市民们注意
Citizens should be advised,

725
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,640
目前华盛顿特区的网络
a wave of disruptions is currently affecting

726
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,420
和手机信号正受到干扰
Internet and cellular service in the DC area.

727
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,290
交通及出行可能受影响
Expect traffic and travel delays

728
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:25,560
官方仍在努力
as authorities are still trying

729
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,810
确定问题的影响范围
to determine the scope of the problem.

730
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,880
-能赶上飞机吗  -不知道
- Are we gonna make this flight? - I don't know.

731
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,860
有消息推测
Unconfirmed reports speculate

732
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,250
干扰可能是一起网络攻击

州长  恐怖分子正在袭击

790

803

乱来就会变成这样
This is what happens.

804
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,620
当你滥用"战争"这个词  事情就会变成这样

全都乱作一团

807
00:50:19,950 --> 00:51:19,950
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}压制投票的问题是近些年美国两党分歧较大  斗争激烈的一个政治议题
这个问题的核心是  共和党主张为了防止选举舞弊
应该在投票时要求选民出示有效的身份证件  但是民主党认为
由于民主党选民大多生活窘困  办理驾照或身份证件很困难
所以要求出示身份证件  实际上就是要阻止底层选民投票
而共和党反过来指控民主党这种立场是鼓励有利于自己的非法移民投票
这一问题在美国多地引发了多起高调的诉讼
一般是一些共和党占多数的州议会和政府出台相关法律
要求投票时出示证件  然后支持民主党的民权组织提起诉讼
称这种法律违宪  目前美国有多个州的选民证件法面临法律挑战
其它压制投票的方法还有减少投票点  缩短提前投票时间等
