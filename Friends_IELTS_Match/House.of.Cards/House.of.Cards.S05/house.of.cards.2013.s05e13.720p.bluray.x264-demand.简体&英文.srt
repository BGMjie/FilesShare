我只是想走前最后看你一眼
I just wanted to see you one last time before I leave.

23

我觉得没什么好说的了
I don't believe there's anything left to be said.

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,400
我俩确实无话可说了
No, not between us. Not any longer.

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,250
我只是想谢谢
I just wanted to thank you for...

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,160
你的韧劲
your tenacity.

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,380
无论你想干什么  你都无法逍遥法外
Whatever you're up to, you won't get away with it.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
也许我已经做到了
Maybe I already have.

29
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,720
委员会将继续工作
The committee will continue its work.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,760
我们会建议司法部提出起诉

罗谢尔

33
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,170
多美的名字
Such a lovely name.

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,050
告诉我你有多么不想那名字上新闻
Tell me how much you don't want that to end up in the press.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,590
然后解散这个委员会
And then shut this committee down.

36
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,810
你得无条件听我的
No deals.

37
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,400
总统先生  总统先生
Mr. President! Mr. President!

38
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,850
你怎么能这样
How could you?

39
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,280
-你怎么能不提前告诉我  -为了保护你
- How could you not warn me? - To protect you.

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,850
-我是要保护你  -你别碰我
- I was protecting you. - You should take your hands off me.

41
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,810
如果你觉得措手不及  我理解
No, look, I understand if you feel broadsided.

42
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,400
-我不在意什么感觉  弗兰西斯  -但听我说
- I don't care about feelings, Francis. - But listen to me...

43
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,480
克莱尔  听我说
Look, Claire, listen to me.

44
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,360
你让我把丑出尽了
You made me look absolutely ridiculous.

45
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,790
-毫无准备  稀里糊涂  -不  克莱尔
- Ill-prepared and ignorant. - No! Claire.

46
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,220
-我们有一条规则  弗兰西斯  -不
- We have one rule, Francis. - No,

47
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,920
-一条  -现在没了
- One rule.  - not anymore. Not anymore.

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,960
-没了  -如果我不知道你的想法
- We don't. - I cannot be your ally

49
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,490
就无法当你的盟友
if I don't know what you're thinking.

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,030
克莱尔  事情本会闹个没完
Listen, Claire. It would have never ended.

51
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,540
好吧  就算阻止了司法委员会
All right, fine, we got to stop judiciary,

52
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,720
其他委员会也会冒出来
but other committees would have sprung up,

53
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,330
一直指控我们
just to keep the charges going.

54
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,960
监管  军事  外事  情报等等委员会
Oversight, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence.

55
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,050
事情会没完没了的
It would have gone on and on.

56
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,350
-年复一年的  -我不管  弗兰西斯
- Years and - I don't care, Francis.

57
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,210
-调查  -你该跟我说的
- years of investigation. - You should have talked to me,

58
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,650
而不是像这样临时决定
instead of making a last-minute decision like this.

59
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,830
我没有
I didn't.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,340
我制造了这混乱  好利用它
I created this confusion in order to take advantage of it.

61
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,730
所有事情都是计划好的
Everything that has happened... was planned.

62
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,490
何时开始的
Since when?

63
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,030
去极乐之地前
Since before Elysian Fields.

64
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,450
但我是在极乐之地猛然领悟到
But it was at Elysian Fields that it hit me.

65
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,720
我明白了
I saw it...

66
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,440
就像头顶上的灯泡亮了起来
almost like a light bulb going off above my head.

67
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,790
真正的权力在何处
Where does the real power lie?

68
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,640
就是权力背后的权力
The power behind the power.

69
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,920
克莱尔  我明白了
And I understood, Claire,

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,570
我们不能像过去那样思考行动
that we have to think and act differently than we ever have.

71
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,370
因为关键已经不在于谁住在白宫
Because it's no longer about who lives in the White House...

72
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,570
而在于谁拥有白宫
it's about who owns the White House.

73
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,340
这可是总统一职  政客还能爬多高
This is the presidency. How much higher can a politician go?

74
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,960
真正的权力不在这儿
The real power isn't here.

75
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,770
而在之外
It's beyond here.

76
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,010
超越了它  但仍要与之配合工作
It's above it, but still working in conjunction with it.

77
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,990
克莱尔  你我一直都在圈内
Look, Claire, you and I have always been on the inside.

78
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,670
被困在泡泡里
Trapped. In the bubble.

79
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,750
但从今往后
But going forward...

80
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,360
我在私营部门经营圈外
with my operating on the outside, in the private sector,

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,780
你在这里工作
and you working from here...

82
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,100
我们能一起拥有白宫
we can own this house together.

83
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
你不明白吗  这是我计划好的
Don't you see? I've designed this.

84
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,760
我想让你当总统
I wanted you to be the president.

85
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,770
我让你成为了总统
I've made you the president.

86
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,020
我该向你道谢吗
Am I supposed to say thank you?

87
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,380
不
No.

88
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,370
但你得赦免我  赦免我所有的罪行
But you will have to pardon me. Pardon me for all of my crimes.

89
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,460
作为总统  只有你才能这么做
As the president, you're the only one who can.

90
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,840
弗兰西斯  如果我这么做会被弹劾
Francis, I could be impeached if I do that.

91
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,790
不会的  戴维斯和厄舍
No, no. Look, Davis and Usher,

92
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,890
他们可以保护你
they're in a position to protect you.

93
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,250
-他们希望你成功  -世事难料  弗兰西斯
- They want you to succeed. - We can be sure of nothing, Francis.

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,680
道格的事
Everything going on with Doug,

95
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,690
白宫还有泄密者
the leak still in the White House...

96
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,380
不  那也是我
No, that was me, too.

97
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,670
-什么  -我就是泄密者
- What? - I'm the leak.

98
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,550
这几个月我一直在道格的帮助下
I've been feeding information to Tom Hammerschmidt

99
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,660
给汤姆·汉默施密特放料
for months with Doug's help.

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,550
这没道理  弗兰西斯
That doesn't make any sense, Francis.

101
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,610
克莱尔  如果你在别人之前扳倒自己
Claire, when you bring yourself down before someone else can,

102
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,940
你就能控制这个过程了
you control the way it happens.

103
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,890
只有这条路才能让我们来到此刻
This was the only path to get us to this moment

104
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,140
你和我  能够拥有一切
where you and I can own it all.

105
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,610
撤掉监控
Get rid of the surveillance.

106
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,090
抹除一切  停掉一切  你跟道格做的一切
Erase it. Shut everything down. Anything you and Doug were up to.

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,750
好  但是你得先赦免我
All right. But you have to pardon me first.

108
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,100
等时机合适  还要赦免道格
And, at the right time, Doug.

109
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,360
否则我们可能都要进监狱
Or we could both go to prison.

110
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,800
我杀了汤姆
I killed Tom.

111
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,930
我杀了汤姆·耶茨  他死了
I killed Tom Yates. He's dead.

112
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,360
我让马克处理掉了
And I had Mark clean it up.

113
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,590
所以这永远不会追查到我们
So it will never make its way back to us.

114
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,090
那我们都做了必须做的事
Well, then I guess we both did what we had to.

115
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,890
-你知道他要做这事吗  -不知道
- Did you know he was gonna do this? - No.

116
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,700
因为这很不好  克莱尔  这非常不好
Because this is bad, Claire. This is very... very bad.

117
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,940
天哪
My God!

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
你们两个怎么回事
What is it with you two?

119
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,690
-如果你在想什么  说...  -在我家里
- If there's something on your mind, say... - In my house?

120
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,440
你把他留在我家里了
You left him in my house?!

121
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,760
小声点  至少改变你的语气
Lower your voice, or at least change your tone.

122
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,960
你处理好了吗
Did you take care of it?

123
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,240
是的  那是我的工作
Yes, that's what I do.

124
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,520
那谢谢你  做得好
Then thank you, and well done.

125
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,750
现在我们回到眼前的事
Now let's get back to what's in front of us.

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,200
他想让你待在这里吗  克莱尔
Does he even want you to be here, Claire?

127
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,290
马克  拜托  我现在需要的是你的政治盘算
Mark, please. What I need right now is your political calculus.

128
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,370
他将你和我们所有人置于了为难的境地
He has put you, he has put all of us, in an impossible position.

129
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,220
你明白吗
You see that?

130
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,420
如果你不能正确处理这件事  就无法恢复了
If you don't handle this correctly, you do not recover from it.

131
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,520
这事关政府的持续运作
This is about continuity of government.

132
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,630
通知北约  通知各国领导人
Informing NATO, informing world leaders.

133
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,010
我们本该让大使们待命的
We should have had ambassadors on call.

134
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,030
参谋长联席会议  国家安全...
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security...

135
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,740
连尼克松都那样做了
Even Nixon did that!

136
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,430
我准备好上交了
I'm ready to hand it over,

137
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,080
但是我要得到保证  不管怎样
but I want to be assured that no matter what,

138
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,170
麦卡伦之死不会牵连到我
Macallan's death is not related to me.

139
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,850
这可以办到
That can be taken care of.

140
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,110
-我要你手上我的东西  -好
- I want what you have of mine. - Okay.

141
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,540
会给你的
That's what you'll get.

142
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,820
我还要当幕僚长
And I want to be Chief of Staff.

143
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,260
我觉得这不是问题
Well, I don't think that's a problem.

144
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,510
很高兴你在提要求
I'm glad you're asking for what you want.

145
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,570
道格·斯坦普会为总统做任何事
Doug Stamper would do anything for the president.

146
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,010
他看到了佐伊·巴恩斯的威胁
He saw a threat in Zoe Barnes,

147
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,020
她跟总统有私情
who the president was involved with.

148
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,980
他就处理掉了
And he took care of it.

149
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,860
他不止一次地威胁过我的生命
He's threatened my life on numerous occasions.

150
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,300
-但是回到我的问题  -不  女士
- But to go back to my question... - No, ma'am.

151
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,200
我不认为总统知道道格在做什么
I don't think the president knew what Doug was up to.

152
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,650
完全不了解
Not at all.

153
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,050
汉默施密特先生
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

154
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,510
我想给你打电话来着
I've been meaning to call you.

155
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,120
肖恩
Sean.

156
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
你应该能看出来  我现在在这里工作
As you can tell, I work here now.

157
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,750
我现在跟你握手
I'm shaking your hand right now

158
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,440
是因为我崇尚社交礼仪
because I believe in social graces.

159
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,980
你迷失了
You're lost.

160
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,530
-我不这么认为  -不  你就是迷失了
- I don't think so. - No, you are.

161
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,740
不  我一点都没迷失
No, not at all.

162
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,280
这就是你想要的
This is what you wanted?

163
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,230
为腐败的政府和走向毁灭的总统卖命
A job in a corrupt administration? Presidency in ruin?

164
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,800
我是在白宫里面
I'm in the White House.

165
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,210
不是在外面  好奇着里面是什么样
Not out there, wondering what it's like in here.

166
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,650
不会很久的
Not for long.

167
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,720
你一旦进来了  就是进来了  这就是美国特色
Once you're in, you're in. It's the American way.

168
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,610
-斯坦普先生现在可以见你了  -谢谢
- Mr. Stamper will see you now. - Thank you.

169
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,780
抱歉让你久等了
Sorry to keep you waiting.

170
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,410
当我提出这次会面时  我不知道
When I asked for this meeting, I had no idea

171
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,180
总统今晚要签字辞职
the president would be signing his resignation this evening.

172
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,910
还有我  今天早上辞职
And I, this morning.

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,830
-我听说了传闻  -现在确定了
- I heard a rumor you might. - Now it's confirmed.

174
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,370
斯坦普先生
Mr. Stamper...

175
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,950
请说  你可以叫我道格
Yeah, please. You can call me Doug.

176
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,520
还是免了  毕竟这是正式采访
I'd rather not, for the sake of this interview.

177
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,260
希望你知道这不是私下谈话
I want you to know this will not be off the record,

178
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,550
或作为幕后消息
or on background.

179
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,160
我确实认识丽萨·威廉姆斯  几年前认识的
I do know Lisa Williams. I met her a couple years ago.

180
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,880
好的
Okay.

181
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,850
但在我们谈其他事之前
But before we get to anything else...

182
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,700
安德伍德总统
did President Underwood,

183
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,300
在还是议员时  是否杀害了佐伊·巴恩斯
when he was congressman, kill Zoe Barnes?

184
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,430
没有
No.

185
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,220
斯坦普先生
Mr. Stamper...

186
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,680
你是否杀害了佐伊·巴恩斯
did you kill Zoe Barnes?

187
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,010
我没准备好回答那个问题
I'm not prepared to answer that question.

188
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,190
你明白我可以白纸黑字写明你拒绝回答吧
You understand I can use your refusal in print.

189
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,860
明白
Yes.

190
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,290
佐伊死的那天  你是否在大教堂高地
Were you on the Cathedral Heights D.C. Metro platform

191
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,790
地铁站的站台上
the day of Zoe's death?

192
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,840
任何涉及佐伊·巴恩斯的问题
Any questions regarding Zoe Barnes,

193
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,690
你得去跟我的律师谈
you need to speak with my attorneys.

194
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,090
佐伊·巴恩斯是否用一部一次性手机
Did Zoe Barnes make a call to Francis Underwood

195
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,970
打给了时任议员的弗兰西斯·安德伍德
from a burner phone when he was congressman?

196
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,410
-你为什么要问我  -你为什么不回答
- Why would you ask me that? - Why won't you answer?

197
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,750
总统的手机几乎都是我在接
I almost always answer the president's phone.

198
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,590
电话  短信
Calls, texts...

199
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,760
你知道那些短信吗
Do you have any knowledge of those texts?

200
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,780
我没准备好作出评论
I'm not prepared to comment on that.

201
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,630
那么这次谈话到此为止
Then this conversation is over.

202
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,140
祝好
Have a good day.

203
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,330
最后一件事
One last thing.

204
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,280
你是否给我寄过两张生日贺卡
Did you send me two birthday cards?

205
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,870
没有
No.

206
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,210
[苏格兰盖尔语]
Slàinte mhath.

207
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,840
是苏格兰盖尔语  意思是"祝安康"
That's Scottish Gaelic. It means "Good health."

208
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,740
我父亲有点执迷
My father's kind of obsessed.

209
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,380
他将我们格雷森家的历史
And he traced our line of Graysons back to,

210
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,800
追溯到了16世纪左右
like, 16th century or something.

211
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,930
如果我们午休时需要喝一杯
Well, if we ever needed a drink in the middle of the day...

212
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,010
联邦检察官那边进展顺利
It went well with the US attorney.

213
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,160
真令人悲痛
It's tragic.

214
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,370
一想到道格做了什么  我们的心都碎了
Our hearts are just broken at the thought of what Doug did.

215
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,900
我不知道他怎么了
I don't know what happened to him.

216
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,760
可能到了某个时候...
I guess somewhere along the line...

217
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,420
他什么时候会宣布辞职
When will, uh, he be announcing his resignation?

218
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,290
-今天下午  -当然
- It's happening this afternoon. - Oh, of course.

219
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,380
赛斯  你也得辞职
And, Seth, you'll need to resign as well.

220
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,870
-我还以为  -我知道  但你想想
- I thought that, uh... - I know, but think about this.

221
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,520
我得建立我自己的团队  得公开进行
I need to establish my own team. Publicly.

222
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,960
不能回避
And there's no avoiding

223
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,850
目前你跟道格和弗兰西斯的关系有多紧密
how tied you and Doug are to Francis at this point.

224
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,430
这只是为了等一切烟消云散  仅此而已
So, it's really just waiting for the dust to settle. That's all.

225
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,550
怎么感觉像是你在告诉我
Why does it feel like you're telling me

226
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
我的职业生涯结束了  副总统女士
my career is over, Madam Vice President?

227
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,440
不  我只是说  你得先离开一阵子
No, I'm just saying, you just need to go away for a little while.

228
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,940
稍后我们会召你回来的
And we'll bring you back into the fold at a later date,

229
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,230
不用担心
and don't worry.

230
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,760
看看莉安  她也离开过  现在她回来了
Look at LeAnn. She left and now she's back.

231
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,040
我们以前一起喝过酒吗
Have we ever had a drink together?

232
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,830
从来没有
Never.

233
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,570
我想在您还是总统时  把这个交给您
I wanted to hand this to you while you were still president.

234
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,450
我带着沉重的心情接受了
I accept this with a heavy heart.

235
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,120
我昨天跟律师们开了一个战略会议
I had a strategy session with the attorneys yesterday.

236
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,850
希望他们好好对你了
I hope they're treating you well.

237
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,070
你知道
You know...

238
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,130
道格  现在起
Doug, we're not gonna be able

239
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,690
我们将有一阵子不能见面了
to see each other for some time now.

240
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,470
不如你拿点什么东西当纪念吧
So why don't you take something?

241
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,310
-不了  -没关系  随意挑吧
- No. - No, no. Go on. Take something.

242
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,560
任何东西  你想要什么都行  即便很小
Anything. Anything you want. Even if it's small.

243
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,040
一个你能握在手里
Something you can hold in your hand

244
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,430
让你回想起这里的东西  直到你回来
to remind you of this place... until you get back.

245
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,920
随便选吧
You go on.

246
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,030
离我的正式辞职只有几小时了
We're a few hours away from my official resignation...

247
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,510
而你还没答应赦免我
and you still have not agreed to pardon me.

248
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,900
如果你不
And if you don't,

249
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,920
我将不得不撤回辞职的决定
I will be forced to renege on that resignation.

250
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,290
那就太过分了
That would be outrageous.

251
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,540
我递交了签字辞呈  才算正式辞职
Well, it isn't official until I submit a signed letter.

252
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,560
这对你余下的总统任期有什么好处
And what would that do to the rest of your presidency?

253
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,330
还能剩下什么
What would be left of it?

254
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,270
克莱尔  如果你不同意
Claire, if you don't do it,

255
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,610
你可能就要与重罪犯是夫妻了
you're gonna risk being married to a felon.

256
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,160
如果我同意  那又置我于何地
And if I do, where does that leave me?

257
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,130
你现在真的想和我谈这个吗
Look, is this really the conversation you want to be having?

258
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,420
你给我设局  弗兰西斯
You've trapped me, Francis.

259
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,490
不  我不接受害了你的指责
No, I do not accept that I've done something to you.

260
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,450
我给你提供了一个机会
I have provided you with an opportunity.

261
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,810
你之前也说过  这就是你的终局
Now, you have said before, that this is your endgame.

262
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,080
眼下你的终极目标唾手可得
And now, your goal is within spitting distance

263
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,040
而你只看到了背叛  我不信
and all you see is betrayal? I don't buy it.

264
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,370
别再纠结我对你做了什么了
Stop talking about what I've done to you.

265
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,110
承认吧
Admit it.

266
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,580
这就是你想要的
This is what you want.

267
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,270
你愿意为之杀人
You were willing to kill for it.

268
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,760
那么克莱尔  接受吧
So, Claire, come and take it...

269
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,670
不然我就要收回了
before I take it back.

270
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,360
我们要挑选最合适的时机和地点
We'll find the most strategic time and place.

271
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,830
但我会特赦你  弗兰西斯
But I will pardon you, Francis.

272
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,810
为了国家利益  我们也应该解散委员会
For the good of the nation, we need to disband this committee,

273
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,500
把这一页翻过去
and put this behind us.

274
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,670
总统很可能撑不过听证会
The president most likely would not have survived the hearings.

275
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,870
你也可以说他是被迫辞职
You could argue that he had no choice but to resign.

276
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,900
但我们也不能否认他的证词引起很大反响
But we can't deny that his testimony struck a chord.

277
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,480
就算是这样
Well, that may be true.

278
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,280
那你  罗梅洛议员
But how is it that you, Congressman Romero,

279
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,100
他最主要的批评者  怎么转而支持他了呢
his biggest critic, are supporting him now?

280
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,540
历史
History.

281
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,030
今天结束时
By the end of the day,

282
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,690
我们国家会第一次有位女总统
the country will have its first woman president.

283
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,200
我一直支持有一位女性
Look, I've always been a supporter of the idea

284
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,580
能入主白宫
of a woman in the Oval Office.

285
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,430
但是说到底
But when all is said and done,

286
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,370
您应该清楚弗兰西斯·安德伍德
you do realize that Francis Underwood

287
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,330
今晚还是会在白宫过夜的吧
will still be sleeping in the White House tonight?

288
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,740
你不是该收拾东西了吗
Isn't this when you pack everything up?

289
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,700
至少带走个人物品
Or at least take the personal things?

290
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,800
我什么都不拿了
I'm not taking anything.

291
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,960
任你处置吧
You can do what you want with it.

292
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,730
-你什么时候见联邦检察官  -后天
- When do you meet with the US attorney? - Day after tomorrow.

293
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,550
我从没想过弗兰克·安德伍德会下台
I never thought that Frank Underwood would not be president.

294
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,480
真没想过
Not really.

295
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,040
你可以逃跑
You could just run away.

296
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,940
那我有什么好处
What does that get me?

297
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,810
你很擅长照顾自己
You're good at taking care of yourself.

298
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
真好笑
That's funny.

299
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,900
我希望你知道我关心你
Look, I want you to know that I care for you,

300
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,820
但恐怕我也帮不上你什么了
but I don't know how much I can be there.

301
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,530
我想就在这里坐一会儿
I think I'm gonna just sit here for a while.

302
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,100
嗯  坐吧
Yeah, you should.

303
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,490
副总统希望你在她宣誓就职之前
Uh, the vice president would like you to leave the White House

304
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,240
离开白宫
before she's sworn in.

305
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,510
她认为最好不要传出什么她就职时
She doesn't think it would be a good idea for word to get out

306
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,240
你还在白宫的消息
that you were here when it happened.

307
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,690
本人庄严宣誓  我必忠实执行
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute

308
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,140
合众国总统职务
the office of President of the United States,

309
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,160
忠于职守  竭尽全力  恪守  维护
and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect

310
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,670
和捍卫合众国宪法
and defend the Constitution of the United States.

311
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,030
-愿上帝助我  -又是这熟悉的一幕
- So help me God. - Here we are again.

312
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,340
知道吗  如果你忽略盛大的仪式和场合
You know, if you ignore all the pomp and circumstance,

313
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,660
最反常的事就是我真的相信总统之位
the most perverse thing is I actually believe in the presidency.

314
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,700
其重要性
Its importance.

315
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,530
对世界的重大意义  哪怕只是象征性的
What it means around the world, even symbolically.

316
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,530
但我更相信权力  信它本身
But I believe in power even more. For its own sake.

317
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,890
戈尔·维达尔[作家]曾写道
Gore Vidal once wrote

318
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,540
权力的目的是权力
that power is an end to itself,

319
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,710
而夺取胜利的本能冲动
and the instinctive urge to prevail...

320
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
是人类最为重要的特性
the most important single human trait.

321
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,560
我总是告诉我自己  我做的一切都是为了她
I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.

322
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,480
但也许并不是  也许我更爱权力
But maybe it wasn't. Maybe I love power more.

323
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,630
为你  和你亲爱的人
For you, and for any dear to you,

324
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,460
我愿做任何事
I would do anything.

325
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,470
如果有幸  我的生涯中
If my career were of that better kind

326
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,310
有做出牺牲的机会或是能力
that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it,

327
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,320
我愿抓住一切机会  为你和你亲爱的人牺牲
I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.

328
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,220
在宁静的时候  请记得我
Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times,

329
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,720
记得我这番热情而真挚的话
as ardent and sincere in this one thing.

330
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,870
那一天终会到来
The time will come,

331
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,030
那一天已经不远
the time will not be long in coming,

332
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,960
你将建立起新的关系
when new ties will be formed about you.

333
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,910
那关系将会更加温情而有力地把你
The ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly

334
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,580
跟你悉心经营的家连结在一起
to the home you so adorn.

335
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,970
那是永远为你增光  令你幸福的最亲密的关系
The dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you.

336
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,740
马内特小姐
Oh, Miss Manette,

337
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,160
等一个长得
when the little picture

338
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,420
和他幸福的父亲一样的小家伙仰起脸看你时
of a happy father's face looks up in yours...

339
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,300
晚上好
Good evening.

340
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,470
晚上好  女士们先生们  我叫肖恩·杰弗瑞斯
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Sean Jeffries.

341
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,010
我是新新闻部副主任
I'm the new deputy director of communications.

342
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,950
赛斯去哪了
Where's Seth?

343
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,710
格雷森先生上台前被叫走了
Mr. Grayson got called away last minute,

344
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,570
所以我临时替代一下他
so I'm temporarily filling his shoes.

345
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,610
我不回答问题
I won't be taking any questions.

346
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,720
我要读一份拟好的声明
Instead, I'll be reading from a prepared statement.

347
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,190
几小时前
A few hours ago,

348
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,510
安德伍德总统
President Underwood resigned

349
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,940
辞去了美国总统一职
the office of President of the United States.

350
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,550
在有白宫人员参加的私密仪式上
And in a private ceremony attended by staff,

351
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,380
克莱尔·安德伍德总统宣誓就职
President Claire Underwood was sworn in.

352
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,130
即刻生效  她将担任
Effective immediately, she will be assuming the office

353
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,740
美国总统一职
of President of the United States.

354
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,620
稍后会具体公布将由
Details will be coming shortly on who will

355
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,920
-谁来接任  -你一定很为他骄傲
- be stepping into the office as - You must be so proud of him.

356
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,550
副总统
vice president.

357
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,430
弗兰西斯·安德伍德总统今天虽无法亲自前来
And while President Francis Underwood couldn't be here today...

358
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,900
三小时前进行了权力交接
Transfer of power happened three hours ago,

359
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,800
过程"私密而低调"
quote, "privately and quietly."

360
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,240
头版头条就是它了
And that's above the fold.

361
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,400
-司法部有什么消息吗  -还没有
- Anything from DOJ? - Nothing yet.

362
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,550
马克·厄舍没有正式头衔
No official title to him,

363
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,820
但权力交接是他主持的
but it's Mark Usher running the transition.

364
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,840
好  我们来看看谁进谁出
Okay. Let's find out who's in and who's out.

365
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,790
多米诺骨牌在不断倒下
The dominoes are falling.

366
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,760
-谁负责调查罗梅洛  -我
- Now, who's on Romero? - Here.

367
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,110
-我们想让议员公开发声  -好的
- We want the congressman on the record. - I've got it.

368
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,510
留着麦卡伦周末再爆料
And let's save Macallan for the weekend.

369
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,160
汤姆  道格·斯坦普怎么样了
Tom, where are we with Doug Stamper?

370
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,730
我得去核查点东西
There's, uh, something I need to check on.

371
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,980
头条网  消息网
Slugline, BuzzFeed,

372
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,470
全市一半的新闻渠道都等着这则大新闻呢
half the outlets in this city are ready to jump on this.

373
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,440
你跟他一对一谈过
You spoke to him. One on one.

374
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,550
-他没说是他干的  -他不用说
- He didn't actually say he did it. - He doesn't have to.

375
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,510
有人知道赛斯·格雷森对联邦检察官说了什么吗
Does anyone know what Seth Grayson said to the US attorney?

376
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,970
汤姆
Tom?

377
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,340
你写这届政府写了两年了
Two years you've been writing about this administration.

378
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,250
-机会来了  -我想继续追查而已
- This is it. - I want to follow up, that's all.

379
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,110
我看见一座美丽的城市
I see a beautiful city

380
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,500
和一个灿烂的民族从这深渊中升起
and a brilliant people rising from this abyss.

381
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,460
在他们争取真正的自由的奋斗中
And in their struggles to be truly free,

382
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,150
在他们的胜利与失败中
in their triumphs and defeats,

383
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,250
在未来的漫长岁月中
through long years to come,

384
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,310
我看见这一时代的邪恶和前一时代的邪恶
I see the evil of this time and of the previous time

385
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,290
前者是后者的自然结果
of which this is the natural birth,

386
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,290
逐渐赎去自己的罪孽  慢慢消失
gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.

387
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,880
华盛顿时间今天凌晨三点左右
Surface-to-surface missiles delivered sarin

388
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,590
地对地沙林毒气导弹
at about three o'clock in the morning, our time.

389
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,680
莫斯科已经发出声明  谴责反政府军
Moscow has already issued a statement condemning the rebels

390
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,540
策划了这场苦肉计袭击
for orchestrating the attack on themselves.

391
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,970
-真是吗  -当然不是
- And did they? - Of course not.

392
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,170
佩特罗夫是想利用它发动正当空袭
Petrov will use this to justify air strikes.

393
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,430
我给你看张照片
I'd like to show you an image.

394
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,660
这张是路透社的
This one is coming out of Reuters.

395
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,560
我有预感  上午大多数媒体都会发这张
The feeling is most of the press will be using it by the a.m.

396
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,460
依我的经验
Experience tells me

397
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,280
这件事会回响个三五天
this will resonate for about three to five days...

398
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,770
也就给了我们机会
which gives us our window.

399
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,400
我们可以准备一份声明
Well, we can ready a statement.

400
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,890
出兵才是真正的声明
Troops on the ground is the statement.

401
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,280
不  我想等找到艾哈迈迪再行动
No, I don't want to do anything until we find Ahmadi's location.

402
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,840
我不确定这件事我们应该选择等待  总统女士
I'm not sure we should wait on this, Madam President.

403
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,670
我想提醒你发出最后通牒的
I'd like to remind you that it was this administration

404
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,510
正是这个政府
that introduced the ultimatum.

405
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,880
你该有所行动
You should act on it.

406
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,780
是  但我都没有像样的团队
Yes, but I barely have a team in place.

407
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,430
你可以用前总统的团队
Well, you can run it by the former president...

408
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,280
前总统就是前总统
The former president is just that.

409
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,110
机会就在眼前
An opportunity has presented itself.

410
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,510
而我想把握住机会
And I'm trying to take advantage of it.

411
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,370
-大家都在战况室了吗  -20分钟前都齐了
- Is everyone in the Situation Room? - As of 20 minutes ago.

412
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,770
时机不对
So, the timing is bad.

413
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,950
如果现在赦免他  会显得你跟他的罪行有关
If you pardon him now, you're associated with his crimes.

414
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,780
共和党人会咬着你不放
Republicans will have a field day.

415
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,690
我们需要掩护
We need some cover.

416
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,930
那就是抓捕艾哈迈迪
Well, that would be Ahmadi's capture.

417
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,810
合适的副总统对我们有好处
The right VP would help all this.

418
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,060
你有更多想法吗
Have you had any further thoughts?

419
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,630
最终名单没变
My short list is the same.

420
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,650
韦斯特维尔特  克拉克  克莱因
Westervelt, Clark, Klein.

421
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,010
克莱因最有可能
Klein would be the strongest bulwark

422
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,070
抵抗对你的弹劾
against calls for your impeachment.

423
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,080
-这是剜肉补疮  -补疮是关键
- Swallowing poison to stay alive. - Alive is good.

424
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,370
我觉得我受不了克莱因
I don't think I can stomach Klein.

425
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,550
他称我为贱人  不如克拉克
He called me a bitch. I prefer Clark.

426
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,930
告诉我  搬走尸体前
Tell me. Before you moved the body,

427
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,360
你帮他合上双眼了吗
were you able to close his eyes?

428
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,190
合上了
Yes.

429
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,380
我知道你很重视他的想法
Look... I know his opinion means a lot to you.

430
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,560
弗兰西斯
Francis.

431
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,610
但让他待在白宫  即便在东厢
But having him here, in the White House, even in the East Wing,

432
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,750
也会干扰我们处理事情
while we're trying to figure this out, it's hard.

433
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,200
总会有人暗示
At some point, someone is going to imply

434
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,410
仍是他在做决定
that he is still making the decisions.

435
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,380
那可不妙
That wouldn't be good.

436
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,140
-我会给她建议  她会想通的  -但愿吧
- I'll advise her. She'll come around. - I hope so.

437
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,790
叙利亚的事  如果她现在不行动
Because if she doesn't act now, when it comes to Syria,

438
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,270
她的总统位子就坐不稳
her presidency could be in danger.

439
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,640
你的未来也有变数
And your future in doubt.

440
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,040
别威胁我  戴维斯女士
Oh, don't threaten me, Ms. Davis.

441
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,720
我不威胁别人
I don't threaten.

442
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,680
我只是想尽量说清楚
I just try to remain as clear as possible.

443
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,690
你帮我做事  我也帮你做事
You offered me your services, and I offered you mine.

444
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,720
要知道
You know...

445
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,020
我比你早来  也会比你晚走
I was here before you and I'll be here after you.

446
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,280
即便如此  让我提醒你
And regardless of that, let me remind you...

447
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,090
没有比我更危险的东西
that nothing is more dangerous than me.

448
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,570
你现在得务实  戴维斯没说错
You need to be practical now. Davis isn't wrong.

449
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,010
我们已经想抓捕艾哈迈迪一年了  弗兰西斯
We've been trying to get our hands on Ahmadi for a year, Francis.

450
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,200
-她还没有实现  -没错  但关键不是她
- She hasn't delivered. - Yes, but this isn't about her.

451
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,790
而是你  还有第一次向全国发表讲话
This is about you and coming out with a strong message

452
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,060
传达出来的有力信息
in your first address to the nation.

453
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,110
关键是为你的任期定下基调
This is about setting the course for your presidency.

454
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,830
要强大  克莱尔
Be strong, Claire.

455
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,320
开战吧
Go to war.

456
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,450
但我需要你离开
But I need you to leave.

457
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,210
离开白宫
Leave the White House.

458
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,800
是  我懂
Yes, I see.

459
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,120
为了能成功赦免你  弗兰西斯
For this pardon to succeed, Francis,

460
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,550
我们得表现得有所疏远
we need to appear to be estranged.

461
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,690
这只是策略
I'm just being strategic.

462
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,630
你建议我去哪
And where do you suggest I go?

463
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,650
我不确定
I'm not sure.

464
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,800
海军天文台
The Naval Observatory?

465
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,110
我觉得副总统府邸还是太近了
I think the vice president's residence is still too close.

466
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,610
抱歉  我只是...
I'm sorry, I just...

467
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,310
我们不能让别人认为你还在干政
We can't have anyone think you're still involved in policy.

468
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,700
如果你动摇了
Look, if you're having second thoughts,

469
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,830
-你现在就该告诉我  -不
- you should tell me now. - No.

470
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,170
-我完全同意  -因为这可不是犹豫的时候
- No. I'm in full agreement. - 'Cause this is no time to hesitate.

471
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,770
我没在犹豫
I am not hesitating.

472
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,000
我只是觉得如果我们不妥当处理
I just believe if we don't play this correctly,

473
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,660
那对公众而言
as far as the public,

474
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,600
我的任期不过就是我俩苟且偷生
my term will be nothing but survival for both of us.

475
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,190
好吧
All right.

476
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,760
我希望你知道我会帮助你
I want you to know I'm here

477
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,170
如果你需要政策或其他事情的建议
if you need any advice on policy or anything else you might need.

478
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,240
谢谢你  我去睡了
Thank you. I'm going to bed.

479
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,300
没有人会像我一样爱你
No one will ever love you as much as I do.

480
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,300
我希望你知道
I hope you know that.

481
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,110
就像我知道没有人会像你一样爱我
Just as I know that no one will ever love me... like you.

482
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,840
"在陶瓷青蛙下面"
"Under the porcelain frog."

483
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,010
答案必须准确  包括大小写
The answers are case-sensitive and exact.

484
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,900
只有一次机会
You won't get a second chance.

485
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,000
-第二个问题  -我最喜欢的棒球运动员吗
- And the middle one? - My favorite baseball player?

486
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,710
"韦德·博格斯"  两个G
"Wade Boggs." Two G's.

487
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,830
最后一个
And the last?

488
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,850
"你在奥斯丁的酒店房间留了什么"
"What did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?"

489
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,870
我的枪在哪
Where is my gun?

490
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,710
给
Here you go.

491
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,100
你能给我什么保证
What guarantees do I have?

492
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,210
我把枪还给你了
I gave you your gun back.

493
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,190
但你为什么给他  我很好奇
But what made you give it to him? I'm curious.

494
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,410
我觉得他有危险
I thought he was in danger.

495
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,680
那你现在怎么觉得
And now you think what?

496
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,270
我想问的就是这个
That is what I'm asking.

497
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,130
只要我在  你会一直是本届政府的成员
As long as I'm around, you'll be a part of this administration.

498
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,910
我们都知道艾丹太多事
We both know too much about Aidan.

499
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,780
克莱尔知道你有多忠诚  我很确定
And Claire knows how loyal you are. I'm sure of it.

500
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,730
所以  你在奥斯丁的酒店房间留了什么
So, what did you leave in that hotel room in Austin?

501
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,590
一条手链
A bracelet.

502
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,190
真糟糕
That's too bad.

503
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,660
我终于看到了
You know, I finally got a look

504
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,230
麦卡伦留给哈维小姐的东西
at what Macallan passed on to Ms. Harvey.

505
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,580
你和你丈夫偷走了这场大选
I was shocked to realize the degree

506
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,120
程度之深  真是让我震惊了
to which you and your husband stole this election.

507
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,940
我得对你实话实说
I need to be honest with you.

508
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,820
我和他谈过
I've been in talks with him about

509
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,480
帮他发起一个基金会
helping him start a foundation of some kind.

510
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,280
换取对你的影响
In exchange for influence over you.

511
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,690
有意思
Interesting.

512
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,860
我想帮你度过这个过渡期
I'm trying to help you navigate this transition.

513
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,620
你对于我是什么人
Who are you to me?

514
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,480
你希望我是什么人
Who do you want me to be?

515
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,830
这个回答不好
That's not a good answer.

516
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,930
你是美国第一任女总统
You're the first woman President of the United States.

517
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,260
你忍了那么多  做了那么多牺牲和妥协
All you've had to swallow, the sacrifices, the compromises.

518
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,400
你会想要自我隔离
You're gonna want to isolate yourself.

519
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,440
不去相信任何人
Not trust anyone.

520
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,900
但你需要的正是这个
But that's exactly what you're gonna need.

521
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,240
需要有人告诉你真相
Someone to tell you what's what.

522
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,230
你就是这个人吗
And is that person you?

523
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,060
是吗
Is it?

524
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,320
我觉得不论我说什么都没法让你相信
I don't think there's anything i could say that would convince you

525
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,150
除非你已经感觉到了
if you don't already feel it.

526
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,890
戴维斯女士  你在要求我发动战争
Ms. Davis, you are asking me to start a war.

527
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,980
而你似乎只在你乐意时兑现诺言
And you seem to deliver on promises when it suits you.

528
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,730
所以  原谅我怀疑你的意图
So forgive me if I question your intentions.

529
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,740
我喜欢你
I like you.

530
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,180
我喜欢在你身边
I like being around you.

531
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,300
有时这让我失去了应有的效率
And sometimes that makes me less effective than I should be.

532
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,750
不论是否赦免你丈夫
Pardoning or not pardoning your husband,

533
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,880
他都是个不利因素
in either case, he's a liability.

534
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,950
如果治疗不当
If it's not treated properly...

535
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,170
你丈夫的肝脏随时可能衰竭
your husband's liver could fail him at any time.

536
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,700
这种事我做不了
It's not the kind of thing I could do.

537
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,660
但我可以找人  或者...
But I could find someone, or...

538
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,180
我...不知你是否知道
I... I don't know if you realize,

539
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,460
即便是胡蔓藤这种药物
but... even something like gelsemium

540
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,300
剂量太高时  也可能致命
can be lethal in higher doses.

541
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,800
我丈夫的健康状况没问题
My husband's health is just fine.

542
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,000
我会继续和他合作  跟随你的领导
I'll continue to work with him. Follow your lead.

543
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,700
这是我委托人的护照
Here's my client's passport.

544
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,930
有几件事我们要再重申一下
There's a few things we want to go over.

545
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,220
还没重申过的吗
That we haven't already?

546
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,720
我必须确定  你们带他出去时不戴手铐
No cuffs, when you walk him out of here. I need to be sure.

547
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,670
拜托  詹姆斯  我们不会这么干的
Oh, come on, James, we aren't gonna play that on this.

548
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,280
你有些很够意思的朋友  斯坦普先生
You have some very good friends, Mr. Stamper,

549
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,890
没让媒体报道这件事
to keep the press out of this.

550
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,940
你会像个绅士一样走出去
You will walk out of here like a gentleman.

551
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,940
我们要他12小时内面见法官
We want him in front of the judge within 12 hours.

552
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,450
我们还不知道是否会起诉他
We don't even know if we're gonna charge him yet.

553
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,760
是我做的
I did it.

554
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,840
继续吧
Let's get going.

555
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,060
你在她的内阁里有什么人
Who do you have on her cabinet?

556
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,880
现在还只是建议
Right now, they're just suggestions.

557
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,100
拜托  我们都知道这是怎么回事
Oh, come on. We both know how this works.

558
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,640
你已经做了决定
You've already made your choices.

559
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,570
如果没有  那就是你没本事
You wouldn't be worth your salt if you hadn't.

560
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,440
我只是希望你先让我过目一下
I just want you to run them by me first.

561
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,200
我能让这个过渡很轻松  也能给你制造麻烦
Look, I can make this transition easy for you or not.

562
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,510
给你一句忠告
And a word of advice.

563
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,860
她会需要
She's gonna need some

564
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,460
桌子那边坐着一些友好的面孔
friendly faces looking at her across that table.

565
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,800
会有一些人...
There'll be a few...

566
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,270
按要求微笑的
who will smile as required.

567
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,600
你看看这个
Would you look at this?

568
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,690
都是前特种部队的
Both Special Forces. Former.

569
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,050
他们知道如何忘记  所以你不必担心
They know how to forget, so you don't have to worry about them.

570
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,890
尸体呢
And the body?

571
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,570
处理好了
It's on ice.

572
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,910
我刚刚和纳泽取得了联系
I just made contact with Nasser.

573
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,290
我们已经拿到了艾哈迈迪的位置
We have secured the location of Ahmadi.

574
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,810
我来召集队伍
I'll assemble the team.

575
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,280
我已经给戴尔海军上将打过电话了
I called Admiral Dale already.

576
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,000
那我们现在得做些决定
So we have some decisions to make.

577
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,930
一旦我们派部队过去
Once we have troops on the ground,

578
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,010
我们需要仔细看一下
we'll need to take a close look

579
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,650
我们为你的内阁考虑的人选
at who we're considering for your cabinet.

580
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,100
你身边需要有战时经验的团队
You'll need a team around you with wartime experience.

581
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,610
我有些建议  已经传达给马克了
I have some suggestions I've passed on to Mark.

582
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,050
我认为中情局的副局长  玛茜·西格森
I think Deputy Director of the CIA, Marcy Siegerson,

583
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,170
会是极佳的国务卿人选
would make a terrific Secretary of State.

584
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,400
我很容易与其协调联系
Someone I could easily liaison with.

585
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,190
我还希望
Well, I was hoping that

586
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,540
你会以某种形式加入我的内阁
you would be on my cabinet, in some capacity.

587
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,300
我会在圈外工作
I'll be operating out of the region.

588
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,020
那是我的强项
It's where my strength lies.

589
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,380
我们有更好的能够接手的人选
There are better people who can take it from here,

590
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
能够在大后方给你建议
advise you on the home front.

591
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,790
哈维小姐  莉安  我们需要调动一下你的职位
And Ms. Harvey, LeAnn, we need to move you.

592
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,990
当然只是暂时的
Uh, just for now, of course.

593
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,750
我以为...
It was my understanding that...

594
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,650
现在一个更老道的幕僚长
Right now a more seasoned Chief of Staff

595
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,830
会向国会和国家传递
would send a strong message

596
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,840
强有力的信息  目前是这样
to the Congress and to the nation. For now.

597
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,290
她会做的  她会派部队过去
She'll do it. She'll send in the troops.

598
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,410
明天下午我就会到迪拜了
I'll be in Dubai by tomorrow afternoon.

599
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,130
我们的交易依旧不变
And our deal stays in place.

600
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,910
等一下
Yeah, hold on a second.

601
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,750
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Ready?  - Go ahead.

602
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,970
是的  哈维女士拿回了她的枪
Yes. Ms. Harvey has her gun back.

603
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,860
麦卡伦的档案在总统那里
Macallan's files are with the president.

604
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,910
任何能把你和选举联系起来的有力证据...
Any hard evidence connecting you to the election...

605
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,770
都在她手上
is in her hands.

606
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,260
那么莉安的工作结束了
Then LeAnn's job is done.

607
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,980
如果你还有什么要说的  现在是时候了
If you have anything to say, now is the time.

608
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,500
你觉得发生了什么
What do you think happened?

609
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,490
我更希望你来告诉我
I'd prefer you tell me that.

610
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,630
迁就我吧  是你要求见面的
Humor me. You asked for this meeting.

611
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,170
你觉得发生了什么
What do you think happened?

612
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,180
我相信佐伊·巴恩斯当时在调查
I believe Zoe Barnes was investigating

613
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,720
你和瑞秋·波斯纳的关系
a relationship you were having with Rachel Posner.

614
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,210
不知怎么的  那会危及到
And somehow, that knowledge would endanger

615
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,160
弗兰西斯·安德伍德
Francis Underwood,

616
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,720
那个你会为其赴汤蹈火的人
who you would do anything for.

617
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,040
但是有人想过佐伊·巴恩斯的生命吗
But did anyone think about the life of Zoe Barnes?

618
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,540
你觉得你能抹去一些东西
You know, you think you can erase something.

619
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,600
然后你发现那是不可能的
Then you find out that's not possible.

620
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,480
汤姆  我的律师根本不想让我和你交谈
Tom, my attorneys didn't even want me to speak with you.

621
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,510
抱歉  没什么好说的了
I'm sorry, there's just nothing more to say here.

622
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,170
我不知道瑞秋·波斯纳怎么了
I don't know what happened to Rachel Posner.

623
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,300
但是我不相信是你杀了佐伊·巴恩斯
But I don't believe you killed Zoe Barnes.

624
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,350
录像里的是你吗
Is this you in this video?

625
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,040
看起来像是我
Looks like me.

626
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,650
我仔细思考了很久  弗兰西斯
I've thought long and hard, Francis.

627
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,880
几乎没睡
Barely slept.

628
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,420
这份工作就是这样
That's the job.

629
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,320
我准备派部队过去
I'm going to send in troops.

630
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,360
我明晚就会宣布
I'll be announcing it tomorrow night.

631
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,710
我觉得你做了正确的事
I think you're doing the right thing.

632
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,350
你讨厌这儿吗
Do you hate it here?

633
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,350
你知道的  我不喜欢宾馆
Oh, you know I don't like hotels.

634
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,800
看着像家  但只是提醒你并不在家
An approximation of home just to remind you you're not there.

635
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,590
我们不是有家的人
Well, we don't live in a home.

636
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,830
我们有一座白宫  借来暂住
We live in a house, borrowed and temporary.

637
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,720
你的眼睛里有什么  有种眼神
Something in your eye. A look.

638
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,980
不一样了
It's changed.

639
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,900
你和我  现在是一样的了
We're the same now, you and I.

640
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,160
-怎么说  -你明白的
- How so? - You know how.

641
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,870
我很久没让我自己感到惊奇了
It's been a long time since I surprised myself.

642
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,840
你会恢复的
You'll recover.

643
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,330
你是世界上权力最大的女人  克莱尔
You're the most powerful woman in the world, Claire.

644
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,910
任何慰藉都难与匹敌
Comfort pales by comparison.

645
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,920
我会在宣布出兵之后宣布这条消息
I'll announce it during the speech, after the troops.

646
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,330
将全面无条件地赦免
A full and unconditional pardon...

647
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,180
弗兰西斯·安德伍德在担任美国总统期间
for Francis Underwood and any crimes he might have committed

648
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,780
可能犯下的任何罪行
against the United States while president.

649
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,760
我很高兴知道这一点
I'm glad to hear that.

650
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,810
我从没动摇过  我只是需要考虑一下方式
It was never in doubt. I just needed to think about how.

651
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,220
那这个安排要维持多久
So how long does this arrangement last?

652
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,180
暂时先这样吧
For the time being.

653
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,630
我们是怎么到这一步的  弗兰西斯
How did we get here, Francis?

654
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,790
别纠结了  已经过去了
Oh, let it go. It's done.

655
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,340
对了  再给你个建议
Oh, and one word of advice.

656
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,120
不管厄舍向你推荐谁做副总统
Whomever Usher offers up to you as vice president,

657
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,010
这个人就是你真正应该小心的人
that's the person that you're really gonna have to watch.

658
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,240
我应付不了的人  我是不会选的
I won't choose anyone I can't manage.

659
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,360
在楼的西南角  继续观察
Southwest corner of the building. Maintain visual.

660
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,610
收到
Copy that.

661
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,530
扔雷
Frag out!

662
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,210
艾哈迈迪在那儿  我看到艾哈迈迪了
There's Ahmadi. I have visual on Ahmadi.

663
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,610
-我看到他了  -冲  开火
- I see him. - Go, go! Fire!

664
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,850
我犯了个大错
I made a terrible mistake.

665
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,280
你做了什么
What did you do?

666
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,960
我都不知道我在做什么  我
I don't even know what I'm doing here. I, uh...

667
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,530
早上我开着车就出来了  我怕了
This morning I started driving. I... I got scared.

668
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,140
总之我正往回赶  我能去见你吗
Anyway, I'm on my way back. Can I come see you?

669
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,070
当然
Yes, please.

670
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,530
有时候看电影  你并不一定要看到最后
Sometimes you don't have to watch the whole movie

671
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,230
才知道结局
to know how it ends.

672
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,400
两党对演讲的反应应该会都不错
The speech is gonna play well with both parties.

673
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,690
和共和党人谈得怎么样了
Where are we with the Republicans?

674
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,600
关于你的内阁  我们正在交换名单
Trading names when it comes to your cabinet.

675
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,360
选了几个将军  这会有利
We have our generals, which is good.

676
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,650
有几个是公司出身  圈外人
Some corporate types, outsiders.

677
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,180
让你看着像个打破陈规的人
Make you seem like a renegade.

678
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,200
公司  从哪来的
Corporate, from where?

679
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,070
大多数是石油和银行业  也有搞技术的
Oil, banking, mostly. Some tech.

680
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,900
再掺几个特区的长期议员
Occasional D.C. lifer sprinkled into the mix

681
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,550
好让你的内阁按时开工
to make sure the trains run on time.

682
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,810
我在看副总统的名单
I was going over our list for vice president.

683
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,220
等等
Yeah. Hold on.

684
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,370
这可能有点意外
this will seem unexpected,

685
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:33,640
但是我问过的许多人都说我最合适
but a lot of the people I spoke to suggested me.

686
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,410
可你不是政客
You're not a politician.

687
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,870
没错
Exactly.

688
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,020
但我可以守在你身边
But I could be by your side.

689
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,760
这样国会两院大多数人都伤不到我们
Most of the Hill and the Senate would not come near us.

690
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:52,720
我会考虑的
I'll take it into consideration.

691
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,770
不能考虑了  你需要我
It's beyond that. You'll need me.

692
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,760
什么
Excuse me?

693
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,310
我能帮你
I can help. Look...

694
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,780
只有这样才能保住你的位子
It is the way to keep you in power.

695
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,890
和你的秘密
And keep your secrets.

696
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,470
晚上好
Good evening.

697
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,870
我在此向全体美国人民和全世界郑重宣布
I'm here to report to the American people and the world

698
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,380
在今天上午

00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,350
特种部队击毙了哈里发国恐怖分子

700
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,130

00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,810
我们干掉他了

702
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,130
我们消灭他了
We got him.

703
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,050
在每一位男女总统任职期间
Now, there comes a time in every president's tenure

704
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,990
他们总会面临这么一个问题  就是要不要
when he or she must face the question of whether or not

705
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,530
派遣美国年轻人上阵杀敌
to send young American soldiers into harm's way.

706
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,770
对我而言
In my case...

707
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,820
我上任之初  就要面对这个难题了
that time has fallen within the very first days of my presidency.

708
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,630
俄罗斯总统维克多·佩特罗夫与中国合谋
Russian President Viktor Petrov collaborated with the Chinese

709
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,990
试图在南极洲非法开采石油

710
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,200
最近我们又了解到  他已派出军队
Recently, we have learned that he has sent troops

711
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,510
与叙利亚当局并肩作战
to fight alongside the Syrian regime,

712
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,890
协助他们毁灭叙利亚国家
assisting them in the destruction of the Syrian nation.

713
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:13,790
政府军使用化学武器攻击自己的人民
These forces are using chemical weapons on their own people,

714
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,510
折磨异议人士
torturing the opposition,

715
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,430
让全国绝大多数人口忍饥挨饿
and starving huge segments of the population.

716
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,980
叙利亚人民已饱受战乱之苦
The Syrians are a people besieged.

717
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:24,400
不要再让他们被遗忘了
Let them not also be forgotten.

718
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:28,700
我们将怒火转化成行动的时机已经到来
The time has come for our outrage to be turned into action.

719
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,060
五个月前  我丈夫
Five months ago, my husband

720
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,390
曾向众议院发出呼吁
addressed the House of Representatives

721
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,530
要求他们向哈里发国宣战
and asked them to declare war on ICO.

722
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,690
国会让他失望了
Congress failed him.

723
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,740
国会让人民失望了
Congress failed you.

724

哈里发国极端分子图谋让我们的民主和国家

725
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,960
轰然崩塌

726
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,870
我们决不能让他们得逞
We cannot allow that to happen.

727
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,520
我们不能再等待国会了
We can't wait for Congress any longer.

728
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,940
我们给国会的机会已经够多了
We gave Congress every chance.

729
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,100
她是不打算说了
She isn't going to say it.

730
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,310
历史在评判每一位领袖  每一位总统的时候
Now, history judges every leader, every president,

731
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:07,020
都要看他或她是怎么对待自己的人民的
by how he or she treats his or her own people.

732
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,870
一个悍然攻击医院  难民营
A regime that would target hospitals, refugee camps,

733
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,730
学校和救济车队

{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}在过去几年中  美国对叙利亚的政策一直是外交事务的中心
而奥巴马和特朗普两任总统在这一事务中采取了截然不同的立场
2012年8月20日  奥巴马宣布"阿萨德政权如果使用化武便越过了'红线'"
2013年8月21日  媒体报道叙利亚境内大量平民遭到化武袭击
1429人罹难  包括426名儿童
全世界都以为奥巴马将对叙动武  美军军舰也部署完毕
但奥巴马临时改了主意  决定暂停武装打击计划  而寻求国会授权
最终不了了之  许多评论认为  此后普京在东欧放手东扩
也是觉得奥巴马外交上比较软弱  不会干涉克里姆林宫的行为

777
00:55:18,520 --> 00:56:18,520
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}特朗普上任后  也遇到了阿萨德使用化武的事件
由于竞选时他反对过度干预国际事务  所以白宫虽发表了严厉声明
但媒体和美国公众  都没预料到特朗普真的会有决心进行武力打击
4月6日晚  白宫和五角大楼向媒体宣布
特朗普下令让部署在地中海的两艘美国海军军舰
向叙利亚政府军的一个空军基地  发射了60枚战斧导弹
摧毁了该基地的一些设施和战斗机
特朗普上任后  屡屡受到批评  媒体也多次爆出他的丑闻
但叙利亚打击后  不仅参众两院的民主党领袖都公开发表声明
对此举表示肯定和认可  媒体也破天荒地交口称赞
打击叙利亚成了特朗普总统生涯中  迄今为止最闪光的时刻
