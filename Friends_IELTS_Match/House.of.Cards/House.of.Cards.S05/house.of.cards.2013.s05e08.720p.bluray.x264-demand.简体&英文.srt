我们崇敬你  我们崇敬你  我们崇敬你

人间烟火烧不尽俗世烦恼
No mortal flame can destroy common woe.

22
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,700
唯有真火才能将其震慑
Just one fire can conquer.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,580
那就是在极乐之地燃烧的真火
Fire that burns in the fields of Elysium.

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,380
致敬吧  弟兄们  众弟兄
Hail, brothers! Many brothers!

致敬吧  同胞  致敬降临在翠绿王国的圣鸦
Hail, fellowship! Hail Crow in his verdant kingdom.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,490
俗世烦恼啊  散去吧
Common woe, be done!

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,840
致敬吧  弟兄们  俗世烦恼啊  散去吧
Hail, brothers! Common woe, be done!

看看四周吧
Yeah... look around.

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,010
世界上最有权势的一些人
Some of the most powerful men in the world

37
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,850
聚集在这片林间空地
are gathered in this clearing.

38
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,770
他们都是全国最难加入的俱乐部的成员
Members of one of our country's most exclusive clubs.

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,410
仅限邀请  当然了  除非你不请自来
Invitation only, unless, of course, you invite yourself.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
他们在这里聚集  是想
They gather here to seek God

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,890
在参天大树和绿林之间与上帝交心
between the branches of these magnificent trees.

42
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,690
他们一起吃喝  一起撒尿
They eat together, they piss next to each other,

43
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,650
就像周末烤肉一样切割这世界
and they carve up the world like a Sunday roast.

44
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,750
真正的权力就在这里
This is where the real power is.

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,790
女人和总统禁止入内
No women or presidents allowed.

46
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,150
我不是前者  我将会再次成为后者
The former, I am not. The latter, I will be again,

47
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,980
因为我成功将一场全国大选
because I have managed to reduce

48
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,590
缩小到了一个州的竞争
a national election down to one state.

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,550
虽然让这些人
And while these men here

50
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,500
左右全国的选票不太可能
can't swing the votes of an entire nation...

51
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,920
但区区一个小州
one measly state?

52
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,130
他们还是可以的  所以我才来到这里
Well, that they can do. And that's why I'm here.

53
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,560
那么  欢迎来到极乐之地
So welcome to Elysian Fields.

54
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,430
他不在  你是不是觉得很别扭
It's strange for you, isn't it? Without him here.

55
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,780
没什么别扭的  夫人
It's not strange, ma'am.

56
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,200
莉安去辛辛那提敲定辩论的事了
LeAnn's in Cincinnati, trying to close the deal for the debate.

57
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,550
等总统回来  就巡回全州  出席多场
The president will make a series of appearances across the state

58
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,960
拉票活动
as soon as he gets back.

59
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,410
如果他能挺过这个周末  有消息吗
If he survives the weekend. Anything?

60
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,620
那里不让带手机
No phones allowed.

61
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,640
我们这是分头行动  各个击破
Well, we're dividing and conquering.

62
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,210
这份对华贸易协定
This Chinese trade agreement

63
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,860
会让俄亥俄州选民非常开心的
is going to make Ohio voters very happy.

64
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,340
能帮我们胜选
It could help us win.

65
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,100
-我不知道协议谈妥了  -就快谈妥了
- I didn't know the deal had closed. - Well, we're on the verge.

66
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,140
等总统到坎顿出席活动的时候可以当众宣布
The president can make the announcement in Canton when he appears.

67
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,440
不用了  我自己宣布就行
Oh, no, I'll be announcing myself...

68
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,790
毕竟是我谈定的
since I did the deal.

69
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,920
道格  你非常真诚
Doug, you are very sincere...

70
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,210
对弗兰西斯也很忠诚
and very loyal to Francis.

71
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,810
我也忠于你  夫人
And loyal to you, ma'am.

72
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,860
我希望您知道这一点
I hope you know that.

73
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,310
其实你叫我克莱尔也是可以的
I don't mind it if you call me Claire, you know.

74
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,270
我这就带戴维斯女士进来
I'll show Ms. Davis in.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,190
你好啊  简
Hi, Jane.

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,390
在会见部长之前  你能和我一起
Would you mind going over these numbers with me

77
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,020
再过一遍这些数字吗
before we meet with the minister?

78
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,330
我知道中方嘴上能接受的数字
I have what China says they'll settle for,

79
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,270
也知道他们心里愿接受的数字
and what I know they'll settle for.

80
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,050
我想感谢你在这件事上给我们的帮助
And listen, I want to thank you so much for helping us with this.

81
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,960
我就想看到安德伍德执政
I'd like to see an Underwood administration.

82
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,730
道格  没别的事了
Doug, that's all for now.

83
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,710
好的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,520
-你可以给我看的  -我不想让你看
- You can show me. - I don't want to.

85
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,180
你不用这么保护我
You don't have to protect me.

86
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,160
她们每个人背后都有一段故事
Each of them has a story.

87
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,640
就算她们后来迷失了
Even if they got lost somewhere.

88
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,560
消失比你想得要困难
It's harder to disappear than you would think.

89
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,730
但瑞秋
But Rachel...

90
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,610
完全不见踪影
is nowhere.

91
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,390
这脖子我一眼就认出来了
I recognize that neck.

92
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,140
弗兰克·安德伍德  真没想到
Frank Underwood, as I live and breathe.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,220
打赌你赢了
Well, I owe you this.

94
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,920
他不认为你会来
He didn't expect you to show up.

95
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,430
能见到老朋友总是很开心
I'm always happy to see old friends.

96
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,650
交新朋友也很开心  弗兰克·安德伍德
And make new ones. Frank Underwood.

97
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,990
-本杰明·格兰特  -波利跳的那位  是啊
- Benjamin Grant. - Oh, of Pollyhop. Of course.

98
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,230
你是我对手的强烈支持者
You're a big supporter of my opponent.

99
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,550
他是个高瞻远瞩的人  也是我朋友
He's a forward-thinking guy and a friend,

100
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,880
他现在应该是总统
who should be president right now.

101
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,470
先生们  在这儿的时候
There's no talking politics or business

102
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,400
不能谈政治或生意
while we're here, gentlemen.

103
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,220
是啊  我们可别用争吵荼毒了自然
Yes, we don't want to poison all this nature with words.

104
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,270
你知道这儿的口号
You know the motto.

105
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,740
是啊  "辛勤的蜜蜂别在这儿干活"
Yes, "Buzzing bees, sting not here."

106
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,970
想看不见都难
It's hard to miss.

107
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,680
泰德  这几位你都认识吧
Ted, I think you know everybody.

108
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,960
俗世烦恼毫无胜算  总统先生
Common woe never stood a chance. Mr. President.

109
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,560
据我所知  这是你第一次受邀
First time you've been invited, I understand.

110
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,950
这句话里肯定有侮辱的意味  将军
I'm almost sure there's an insult in there somewhere, General.

111
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,020
泰德和我
You know, Ted and I

112
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,860
刚刚在坎顿一家牛排店
just had the most remarkable piece of red meat

113
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,810
吃到了最好吃的红肉
at a steak house out in Canton.

114
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,500
我记不清了  你喜不喜欢上等肋条
I can't remember, do you like prime rib?

115
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,660
要是有合适的人陪的话
In the right company.

116
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,490
先失陪了
If you'll excuse us,

117
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,390
泰德和我答应本杰明
Ted and I promised young Benjamin here

118
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,620
给他点一杯成人饮料
we'd find him an adult beverage.

119
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,530
-喝酒吗  -还是不了
- Drink? - I'd rather not.

120
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,730
所有人都想跟将军
You know, everybody was looking forward to

121
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,430
谈几句
spending some time with the general.

122
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,420
现在你也来了
And now you're here as well.

123
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,900
这个周末之后  谁知道呢
After this weekend, who knows?

124
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,270
也许这混蛋大选
Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election

125
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,050
能自行解决
will get itself resolved.

126
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,840
既然你来了
Oh, one little piece of advice

127
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,210
我还想给你一条小小的建议
that I could give you as long as you're out here.

128
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,610
要是你不招惹胡蜂  他们也不会惹你
If you don't bother the yellow jackets, they won't bother you.

129
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,830
你为什么不邀请康威
So why didn't you invite Conway?

130
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,360
被邀请的是布洛哈特
Brockhart was invited instead.

131
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,550
下周不会有辩论了  对吧
So there's not going to be a debate next week, is there?

132
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,250
不会有总统辩论
Not a presidential one, no.

133
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,270
我真应该在俄亥俄  跟人握手
I should really be in Ohio, shaking hands.

134
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,110
你可是费了好大劲进来的  弗兰西斯
Yeah, you bargained to get in here, Francis,

135
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,890
既然你都来了  那我给你点建议
and now you're here. So let me suggest something.

136
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,080
去他的俄亥俄
Fuck Ohio.

137
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,780
这就是竞选
This is the campaign.

138
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,030
将军是个叛徒  这你清楚
The general is a traitor, you know that.

139
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,460
将军想当个政客
The general is trying to be a politician.

140
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,070
换成你也会这么做
You would have done the same.

141
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,350
对  但做得更高明
Yeah, but better.

142
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,170
安德伍德总统
President Underwood?

143
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,940
安德伍德总统  抱歉  女士
President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am,

144
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,920
但战况室急需你过去
but you're needed in the Situation Room.

145
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,230
凯茜
Cathy.

146
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,070
进屋之前  我想先跟你说句话
I wanted a moment with you before we join the rest of the team.

147
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,560
-来的路上他们已经跟我说明了  -说得不全
- Oh, I was briefed on the way over. - Not fully.

148
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,970
一艘俄罗斯考察船受困  在下沉
A Russian research vessel is stuck and sinking--

149
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,780
对  他们声称是在采集冰芯样本
Yes, they claim they were taking core samples,

150
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,590
全球变暖那套屁话
some global warming nonsense.

151
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,520
但他们其实是在勘探石油
But they were looking for oil.

152
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,110
他们发出了求救信号
There was a distress signal

153
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,280
然后通讯就完全中断了
and then all communication just shut down.

154
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,470
我们是附近唯一能发起救援的国家
We're the only country in position to rescue.

155
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,850
所以20分钟前  我们向他们提出援救
So, 20 minutes ago, we offered.

156
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,440
-他们不接受  -而且拒不承认
- They declined? - And denied.

157
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,350
佩特罗夫不希望我们知道船上有什么
Petrov does not want us to see what's on board.

158
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,700
我明白这决定很难做
I understand this is a difficult decision,

159
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,440
但人命关天
but there are human lives at stake,

160
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,810
如果救援队抵达
and if help arrives,

161
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,470
-佩特罗夫只能被迫接受  -好吧
- Petrov will be forced to take it. - Okay.

162
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,890
谢谢  我得直接和佩特罗夫总统通话
Well, thank you. I need to speak with President Petrov directly.

163
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,660
海上救援  给你机会羞辱我们吗
A rescue at sea and a chance to embarrass us?

164
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,320
而且就在第二次大选日前夕
Just before your second Election Day?

165
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,690
感觉更像是我帮你  对吗
Sounds like I would be helping you, hmm?

166
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,460
船一沉  你的船员就会死
The boat sinks, your crew dies.

167
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,480
俄罗斯国内舆论会怎么样
How is that going to look at home?

168
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,140
我让我的人民怎么想  他们就会怎么想
I tell my people how things look, and that's how they look.

169
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,950
我想给你看个东西
I want to show you something.

170
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,880
稍等
Wait a minute.

171
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,920
这个  你喜欢我的样子吗
There. Do you like my face?

172
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,740
你不适合留胡子
A beard doesn't suit you.

173
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,550
不知你的人民会对你做的事有何感想
I wonder how your citizens would feel about what you've done.

174
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,390
我可以把你们的船员送回俄罗斯  维克多
I could return your crew to Russia, Viktor.

175
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,730
你把艾丹·麦卡伦还给我们
You could return Aidan Macallan.

176
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,290
我不喜欢量化人的价值
I don't like to quantify human worth...

177
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,030
但麦卡伦的价值确实更高
but Macallan's is higher.

178
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,980
社交媒体是个强大的工具
Social media is a powerful tool.

179
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,680
如果美国采取任何救援措施
If there is any rescue attempt by the United States,

180
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,220
我就告诉俄亥俄州的人民你的真面目
I will tell the people of Ohio exactly how you look to them.

181
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,630
告诉他们你是如何破坏他们州的选举的
Exactly how you disrupted their state's vote.

182
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
他们会相信我的
And they will believe me.

183
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,440
奥本海默也曾是成员
Oppenheimer was a member.

184
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,450
那边那棵树
That tree right over there,

185
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,730
曼哈顿计划就是诞生在那棵树下
right under that tree, Manhattan Project was born.

186
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,100
而我在这颗树下小解
And right under this one, I'm relieving myself.

187
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,220
希望你不是把我和原子弹画上等号
I hope you're not equating me to the atom bomb.

188
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,290
你想要什么  内阁职位
What do you want? Cabinet position?

189
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,660
-弗兰克·安德伍德  -司法任命
- Frank Underwood-- - Judicial appointments?

190
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,980
-支持你的法案  -勿谈公事  勿谈公事
- Legislative support? - Ah, buzzing bees, buzzing bees.

191
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,860
对哦  因为曼哈顿计划
Oh, right. Because the Manhattan Project

192
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,040
和商业或政治
had absolutely nothing to do

193
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,770
-毫无关系  -我希望你放松
- with business or politics. - I want you to breathe.

194
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:08,700
我希望你看看月光穿过树稍的景色
I want you to look how the moonlight cuts through the trees.

195
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,510
弗兰西斯  好好利用这次机会
Take this time, Francis,

196
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,480
了解一下其他人
to know your other attendees.

197
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,890
想想你究竟想做一名什么样的总统
Think about what kind of president you really want to be.

198
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,680
这样又如何
What am I supposed to do with that?

199
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,180
就是...
Just...

200
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,220
你就是这么跟将军说的吗
Oh, is that what you told the general?

201
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,960
抗命
Insubordination.

202
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,350
密谋叛变
Clandestine coup.

203
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,450
对  这才是真正的领袖
Oh, yes, that's the stuff of real leadership.

204
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,650
有钱人喜欢军人
People with money like uniforms.

205
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,230
马克  告诉我他们想要什么
Mark, just tell me what they want.

206
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,120
他们在等你
They're waiting for you.

207
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,980
你起得真早  总统先生
You're up early, Mr. President.

208
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,340
习惯了
Always.

209
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,020
你饿吗  我有鸡蛋
Are you hungry? I have, uh, eggs,

210
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,730
还有橙汁  山蛤蜊
and orange juice, mountain oysters.

211
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,150
你说的是牛睾丸  对吗
You mean bull's testicles, don't you?

212
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,500
我喜欢叫它们的本名
I prefer to call things what they are.

213
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,130
出人意料啊
This is unexpected.

214
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,100
我以为你会一直忙着竞选的事
I thought you'd stay out there campaigning

215
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,800
直到最后一口气
till your dying breath.

216
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,350
怎么  把你们丢在这荒山野岭
What, and leave you out here all alone in the wilderness

217
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,120
去做那些重要的决策吗
to make all these important decisions?

218
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,040
我以前待你不薄  雷蒙德  我希望你支持我
You've done well by me, Raymond. I'd like your support.

219
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,570
是你妻子待我不薄
I've done well by your wife.

220
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,990
而她现在又正好是掌管白宫的人
Who happens, at this moment, to rule the White House.

221
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,000
别跟我说你是想拿你妻子来贿赂我
Tell me you're not peddling influence with your wife?

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,130
你是说现在的美国代总统吗
Who, you mean the current acting President of the United States?

223
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,980
也就再做两周吧
For the next two weeks.

224
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,800
稍有收敛  那才让人出乎意料呢
A little restraint? Now, that... that would be unexpected.

225
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,920
你的鸡蛋想怎么吃
How do you like your eggs?

226
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,730
下午再吃
In the afternoon.

227
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,330
早上好  总统先生
Good morning, Mr. President.

228
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,800
在极乐之地可没有总统  不是吗
Oh, no presidents here at Elysian Fields, isn't that right?

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,220
只有前任的  或者将来的
Only former ones... or future.

230
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,110
我不会把这称为政治  这只是时事
Well, I won't call this politics, then. Just current affairs.

231
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,980
我们有过很好的机会拿下艾哈迈迪
We had a real chance to get Ahmadi.

232
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,010
我们的团队收到简报了
Our campaign was briefed.

233
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,800
你们知道得要更详细些吧
I think a little more than just briefed.

234
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,590
你有多的袜子吗  雷蒙德
Do you have an extra pair of socks, Raymond?

235
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,530
服了30年的兵役
After 30 years of military service,

236
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,230
按说我该自己备好呢
you'd think I'd arrive prepared.

237
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,780
这里肯定有人能帮你找一双[胆子]
Oh, I'm sure someone around here could find you a pair.

238
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,290
-我的铺位下面有  -谢谢
- Under my bunk. - Thank you.

239
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,940
他是个好人
He's a good man.

240
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,260
很难找到不信任或不喜欢他的人
Hard to find anybody who distrusts or dislikes him.

241
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,310
你到底要不要鸡蛋
So do you want eggs or not?

242
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,900
以这个关税率
With this rate of tariff,

243
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,350
我有信心会对反倾销案例
I'm confident it'll have a mitigating effect

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,350
起到减震作用
on the anti-dumping cases.

245
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,720
我觉得这能行
I think this is going to work.

246
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,510
我得向我国外交部国务委员请示
I'll need to run this by my State Councilor for Foreign Affairs.

247
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,450
我认为今天对我们两国都是个好日子
I think this is a very good day for both of our countries.

248
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,750
是的
Yes, it is.

249
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,780
船上有个美国人
There's an American on the boat.

250
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,010
那艘俄罗斯的考察船上
The Russian research vessel.

251
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,280
-你怎么知道的  -你进来前徐先生告诉我的
- And how do you know that? - Mr. Xu told me before you came in.

252
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,000
我需要证据
I will need proof of that fact.

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,240
当然  但我们告诉你
Of course, but we are only telling you

254
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,930
只是因为我们知道你们会想援救他
because we know you'll want to rescue him.

255
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,450
中方愿在力所能及的范围内尽量帮忙
And China is willing to help in any way we can.

256
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,540
我很好奇  徐先生
I'm just curious, Mr. Xu,

257
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,780
你为何如此关注这一情况
why are you so focused on this situation?

258
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,440
出于人道主义原因
For humanitarian reasons.

259
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,950
谢谢您的时间和合作  代总统女士
Thank you for your time and cooperation, Madam Acting President.

260
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,440
这是必要条件
It's contingent.

261
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,000
如果希望部长继续关税交易
The minister won't proceed with our tariff deal

262
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,870
我们必须向他保证  救援已经开展
if we don't give him assurances that the rescue is underway.

263
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,470
中方为何如此关心
Why do the Chinese care so much

264
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,550
这艘俄罗斯船上有什么
about what's on this Russian boat?

265
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,020
不知道  我自己也是刚知道
I don't know. I was just informed myself.

266
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,460
他们在合作吗
Are they working together?

267
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,220
再说一次  我不知道
Again, I don't know.

268
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,720
你在跟他们合作吗
Are you working with them?

269
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,610
我跟谁都合作
I work with everybody.

270
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,300
但这不是重点  关键是船上有个美国人
But that's beside the point. There is an American on board.

271
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,920
你相信吗
And you believe that?

272
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,480
你可不想做出错误的决定
Well, you wouldn't want to make the wrong call.

273
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,570
公牛的睾丸
Bull's balls.

274
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,740
一只大乌鸦
A giant crow.

275
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,650
还有百万富翁们呼喊着  "释我自由"
And billionaires chanting, "Set me free."

276
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,610
这地方真是把我无法言表的感觉都呈现出来了
Well, this place says everything I feel, but can't express.

277
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,170
他不可能是你的朋友
He can't be your friend.

278
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,750
塔斯克没有朋友
Tusk doesn't have any friends.

279
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,810
他是个...伙伴
He's, uh, an associate.

280
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,410
是吗
Really?

281
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,800
他跟你有什么伙伴关系
And how does he associate with you?

282
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,370
别管那该死的蜜蜂了  没人在意它
Oh, to hell with the buzzing bees. No one else is heeding it.

283
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,480
一个电视台总裁  一个电信首席执行官
A network president, a telecom CEO,

284
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
还有一个副总统候选人
the vice presidential candidate.

285
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,780
你觉得他们都在聊什么
What do you think they're all talking about,

286
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,710
-他们最近看的书吗  -你又在看什么
- the last book they read? - What are you reading?

287
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,350
你的脸
Your face...

288
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,170
它让我知道了你有多不想待在这里
which tells me how much you don't want to be here.

289
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,720
塔斯克先生曾是威尔竞选的主要捐助者
Mr. Tusk was a major donor on Will's campaign.

290
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,120
嗯  所以他没受邀  这很有趣
Yes, so it's interesting that he wasn't invited.

291
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,490
我们在合作一个项目
We're partnering on a project.

292
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,550
沙漠里的大规模数据存储中心
Large-scale data storage centers in the desert.

293
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,030
太阳能的
Solar-powered.

294
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,710
我得去准备我的演讲
I need to get ready for my talk.

295
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,840
《来世: 我们留下的》
"The Life After: What We Leave Behind."

296
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,120
但愿你会出席
Hope you'll be there.

297
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,760
你闻闻
Smell that.

298
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,120
高斯巴雪茄
Cohiba.

299
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,100
我知道你很喜欢
I know you're a fan.

300
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,330
虽然我不抽了  但不代表我不能...
Even though I don't smoke anymore, doesn't mean I can't--

301
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,470
谁组织的这周末的聚会  你吗
Who called this weekend's gathering? You?

302
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,250
不是  是塔斯克
No. Tusk did.

303
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,730
怎么
Why?

304
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,200
我们觉得中国人说得对  船上的确有一位美国人
We think the Chinese are right. There is an American on board.

305
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,500
这是撒德·彼得森  两年前退休了
This is Thad Peterson. Retired two years ago.

306
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,520
地球物理研究主任
Director of geophysics research

307
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,470
在美国几家顶尖石油公司供职
for some of the country's top oil companies.

308
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,410
我们强烈怀疑他在那艘船上
We strongly suspect he's on board the boat.

309
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,060
正在和俄罗斯人合作
Working with the Russians.

310
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,490
证据呢
Where's the proof?

311
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,310
这是通讯中断前
This was sent from a Russian sailor's cell phone

312
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,320
俄罗斯船员的手机发出的
before communications were cut off.

313
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,450
打开无线电求救
Get on the radio and call for help!

314
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,860
他的妻子确认
His wife confirmed that

315
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,330
录音里就是撒德·彼得森的声音
this is Thad Peterson's voice on the recording.

316
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,310
24小时后  最多36小时  那艘船就会沉
In 24, 36 hours tops, that boat's gone.

317
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,730
对  但那不能证明撒德·彼得森在船上
Yes, but that doesn't prove that Thad Peterson was on the ship.

318
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,260
但女士  他是美国人
But, ma'am... he is an American--

319
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,660
不  我们不能确定  除非有乘客名单
No, we can't be sure until we have a passenger manifest.

320
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,000
等有更多信息再开会
Let's reconvene when you know more.

321
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,640
-怎么了  凯茜  -你决定不干预
- What is it, Cathy? - Your decision not to intervene.

322
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,120
如果有美国人在非法工作
If an American is working illegally,

323
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,930
他不会出现在名单上
he will not be on the manifest--

324
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,250
我还没做决定  我在等更多信息
I haven't made a decision. I'm waiting for more information.

325
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,280
这关系到了艾丹·麦卡伦
This is about Aidan Macallan.

326
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,510
我非常确信
I am very confident

327
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,280
中国谎称有美国人在船上
China is lying about an American being on board.

328
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,280
船上有他们想要的东西
There is something on that boat they want

329
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,650
得等我知道是什么再说
and I can't proceed until I know what it is.

330
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,220
他们说自己的动机是救人
They say they're motivated by saving human lives.

331
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,880
但那不是他们的真实动机
But that's not what's driving them.

332
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,320
我只是觉得难以接受
And I just find it so frustrating

333
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,720
人命受到如此漠视
when human life is treated with such disregard.

334
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,630
抱歉  但...
We're sorry. But...

335
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,720
俗话说的"林间漫步"不适合我
The proverbial walk in the woods is not for me.

336
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,810
在林荫小径寻寻觅觅
Navel-gazing on some forest path.

337
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,610
思考死亡与永生
Contemplating mortality. Immortality.

338
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,020
才不  历史要去争取
No. History is earned.

339
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,470
赢了今天  然后再去赢明天
You win the day, and then you win the day after,

340
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,010
日复一日  至死方休
and you do the same thing every day until you're dead.

341
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,890
你被载入史册  不是因为你总赢
And you're remembered not for the winning,

342
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,650
而是因为你从不输
but because you never lost.

343
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,830
好了
Now...

344
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,970
道格
Doug?

345
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,530
道格  能听到吗
Doug, can you hear me?

346
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,560
我现在需要些筹码
I need some leverage out here right now.

347
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,630
-怎么了  -康威完了
- What's going on? - Conway is finished.

348
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,690
如果他们胜选
If they win,

349
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,180
布洛哈特会操控大局
Brockhart will do all the heavy lifting.

350
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,720
他会成为真正的总统
He'll essentially be the president.

351
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,180
我们该利用对手研究信息
We should have used the oppo.

352
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,350
听着  布洛哈特是塔斯克挑的人
Listen, Brockhart is Tusk's pick.

353
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,350
我得找办法逼那老头支持我
I need to find a way to force that old man to support me.

354
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,550
-先生  总统先生  -听得到吗
- Sir? Mr. President? - Do you hear me?

355
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,460
我在听
I'm here.

356
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,490
塔斯克和波利跳达成了交易
Tusk has some deal with Pollyhop.

357
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,620
我需要想办法阻止他们
I need to find a way to stop that.

358
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,270
发个行政命令
An executive order...

359
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,410
先生
Sir?

360
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,140
稍有收敛
A little restraint...

361
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,530
那才让人出乎意料
would be unexpected.

362
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,580
总统先生
Mr. President?

363
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,580
-道格  -先生
- Doug. - Sir?

364
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,260
什么都别做
Don't do anything.

365
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,250
我不明白
I don't understand.

366
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,550
什么都别做  等我的指令
Don't do anything until you hear from me.

367
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,190
-先生  波利跳交易怎么办  -听见了吗
- Sir, what about the Pollyhop deal? - Do you hear me?

368
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,570
-什么都别...  -总统先生  我
- Don't do anything... - Mr. President, I...

369
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,360
你打回去了吗
Have you tried calling him back?

370
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,730
没人接  我们该做什么
There's no answer. What should we do?

371
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,370
什么都不做  总统既然说了  那就听他的
Nothing. That's what the president said, so that's what we'll do.

372
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,870
-让护卫把他撤出来吗  -不  我们等着
- Should we have his team pull him out? - No. We wait.

373
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,650
夫人
Ma'am...

374
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,560
-如果我们没能妥当处置营救的事  -道格
- if we don't handle this rescue correctly... - Doug.

375
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,270
让我想办法让总统和佩特罗夫通上电话
Let me find a way to get the president on the phone with Petrov.

376
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,400
不  弗兰西斯不需要分心
No. Francis doesn't need this distraction.

377
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,550
我不同意
I disagree.

378
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,340
我知道你不同意
I know you do.

379
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,370
人说三代之后就没人会记得我们了
They say we're only remembered for three generations.

380
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,210
那一个人该做些什么才能不被忘却呢
What would one have to do not to be forgotten?

381
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,970
小本杰明知道未来是啥样
Young Benjamin here knows what's coming.

382
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,430
谁在乎他没听说过约翰尼·卡森[主持人]
Who cares if he's never heard of Johnny Carson?

383
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
可怜的老塔斯克
Poor old Tusk.

384
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,030
别看他嬉皮笑脸的  但他可骗不了我
He wears that game face, but he doesn't fool me.

385
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,550
未来让他恐惧  因为他知道自己时日无多
The future terrifies him because he knows it's short.

386
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,040
声明一下  我知道约翰尼·卡森是谁
For the record, I have heard of Johnny Carson.

387
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,570
他每天晚上哄我爸妈上床
He tucked my parents into bed every night.

388
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,910
我今天得到了特别的许可
I've been given special permission

389
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,360
向大家展示我们的成果
to show you what we've been working on.

390
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,170
想象这样一种可能  你的大脑  你的意识
Imagine the possibility of your brain, your consciousness,

391
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,370
都实时进行数字化存储
stored digitally in real time.

392
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,000
永生究竟是什么
I mean, what is immortality?

393
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
终有一日  格兰特的设想也会过时
In time, even Grant's vision will get old.

394
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,160
早晚的事  谁都免不了
It will happen, as it does for all of us.

395
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,900
这还只是早期版本
Now this is still in the early stages,

396
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,550
但我们一直在收集储存
but we've been collecting and storing

397
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,900
雷蒙德的记忆  想法  怪癖和爱好
Raymond's memories, thoughts, quirks and tics.

398
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,530
这还只是实验版本  但最终
This is a mock-up. But eventually...

399
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,770
这个雷蒙德
this Raymond...

400
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,470
会像各位眼前这位一样活生生
will feel as real as the one standing before you.

401
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,540
我更喜欢脚踏实地
I like dirt and rocks...

402
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,880
货真价实
and facts.

403
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,970
这我也同意
No argument here.

404
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,850
我只相信能抓在手里的  或者能亲眼看到的
I trust only what I can hold in my hand or see on my horizon.

405
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:18,250
但你不能光干坐着看风景啊
Well, but you can't just sit back and admire the view.

406
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,330
我就发现一定要紧抓当下
I've learned you've got to grab the present by the balls.

407
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,350
那才是美国人民在乎的
That's where the American people live.

408
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,480
你更像个推销员而不是总统  总统先生
You sound more like a salesman than a president, Mr. President.

409
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,010
我们是美国人  我们就是推销员
Well, if we're Americans, then we are salesmen, right?

410
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,420
这是我们天生的权利
That's our birthright.

411
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,630
卖车  卖手机  卖汽油
Cars and phones and a gallon of gas.

412
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,640
我眼里的美国可不是这样
That's not how I see America.

413
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,670
我是爱国者  我为国效力
I'm a patriot. I serve.

414
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,160
那我们向你致敬  将军
Well, then, we salute you, General.

415
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,850
但你为国效力的意义是什么
But you serve to what purpose?

416
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,470
不还是为了其他美国人能去推销
So the rest of America can sell.

417
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,860
你看  这个周末  你和我
I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend,

418
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,910
不就在这个营地推销自己吗
we're here at this camp selling ourselves.

419
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,180
人的品质不言自明
Character speaks for itself.

420
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,220
人民需要一个他们能信赖的总统
People want a president they can trust.

421
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,150
错  不对  他们需要一个他们了解的总统
No, they don't. They want a president they know.

422
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,530
而我也了解他们
And I know them.

423
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,190
我唯一感兴趣的未来就是接下来的四年
The only future I'm interested in is the next four years.

424
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,590
所以没错  我明天要推销  后天接着推销
So, yes, I'm selling tomorrow and the day after that

425
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,300
大后天还要推销
and the day after that.

426
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,260
我是在推销一个曾经住在桃子农场的男孩
I'm selling a boy who used to live on a peach farm

427
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,360
而他现在住在白宫
who now lives in the White House.

428
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,250
我要推销一个
I'm selling a tomorrow

429
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,360
可触可感的明天
that you can see and touch and feel.

430
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,640
要是你把这个夺走
Now, you take that away,

431
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,330
我不知道这国家还剩下什么
and I don't know what this country has left.

432
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,080
只剩下一群成年男人
Except a group of grown men

433
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,570
围成一圈  盯着一小块屏幕
standing around in a circle, all staring at a small screen.

434
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,930
只向内看  而不往外面看
Looking in instead of looking out.

435
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,810
那随时给我盖一把黄土吧
Heck, give me a peck of dirt any day of the week.

436
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,910
说得好  敬黄土
Hear, hear. To a peck of dirt.

437
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,960
-说得好  -我要敬这一杯
- Hear, hear. - I will drink to that,

438
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,850
也要敬将军一杯  他是位优秀的公仆
but I will also drink to the general, a good servant.

439
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,210
敬将军
To the general.

440
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,800
我敢肯定  这一交易随时可能落空
I promise you, this deal is on the verge of falling apart.

441
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,140
就在重新投票之前
Right before your revote.

442
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,910
我只是个传话的
I... I'm only the messenger, by the way.

443
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,050
我们不能让这笔交易落空
We can't let this deal fall apart.

444
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,250
没错  但我们必须马上救援
Agreed. But the rescue has to happen immediately.

445
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,550
你好像跟这事有利益关系
You seem personally invested in this.

446
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,120
不不  我只是在寻找解决方案
Oh, no, no. I'm just looking for a solution.

447
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,590
我有个想法
I had a thought.

448
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,680
我愿意让驻扎在乔治王岛的
I would be willing to allow the Chinese sailors

449
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,450
中国船员登上我们的破冰船
that are stationed on King George Island to board our icebreaker.

450
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,360
然后  在内部摄像机前
Then, purely for the in-house cameras,

451
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,340
摆出是中国领导了此次救援的样子
we let it appear as though the Chinese led the rescue.

452
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,300
当然  自始至终
Now, of course, the whole time,

453
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,280
都会是美国控制船
the Americans would remain in charge of the boat,

454
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,100
但不必让俄罗斯人知道我们参与了
but the Russians don't need to know our involvement.

455
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,750
我觉得这是可以接受的
I imagine that would be acceptable.

456
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,990
我马上就向徐先生转达
I'll relay this scenario to Mr. Xu immediately.

457
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,550
我还想把关税凑整成20%
But I'd also like to round up the tariff to 20%.

458
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,990
我们已经商定19%了
We have a firm deal at 19.

459
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,050
我知道  但突然间  这似乎不够高
I know. But suddenly, it just doesn't seem high enough.

460
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,210
我觉得他们会答应的
I think they'll be okay with it.

461
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,690
祈祷如此吧  我尽力
Fingers crossed. I'll do my best.

462
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,520
-还挺顺利的  -是啊  非常顺利
- That went rather well, I think. - It did. It went very well.

463
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,890
你超出了所有人的预料
You've exceeded everyone's expectations,

464
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,470
整个周末你的表现很出色  但是
the way you handled yourself all weekend, but...

465
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,560
他们能预料布洛哈特的一举一动
Brockhart's someone they can predict.

466
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,630
话先别说太早  这事还没完
Don't get ahead of yourself. This is not over.

467
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,450
你要干什么  弗兰西斯  你要利用对手研究吗
What are you gonna do, Francis? Are you gonna use the oppo?

468
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,140
你似乎很着急嘛
Well, it seems to have worried you enough.

469
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,500
他还只是副总统候选人
He's still only the vice presidential candidate.

470
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,340
我要走了
I'm leaving.

471
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,480
-你不用走的  -我知道  什么都不是必须的
- You don't have to go. - No, I know. I don't have to do anything.

472
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,130
你记得我们第一次见面的情景吧
Do you remember when we first met?

473
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,590
你差一点就加入我第二次竞选了
You almost joined my second campaign.

474
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,980
我们坐在加夫尼的便宜馆子里
We sat down at that little greasy spoon in Gaffney.

475
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,800
记得  要是你招了我  肯定就大获全胜了
Yeah, if you'd signed me on, you would have won by a landslide.

476
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,650
我还是赢了  因为我从不输
I won anyway, because I never lose.

477
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,060
你知道当时我为什么没雇你吗
You know why I didn't hire you back then?

478
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,470
因为你去结账的时候
Because when you went to pick up the check,

479
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,730
你告诉我不用给你钱
you told me I didn't have to pay you.

480
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,410
你愿意不要报酬为我工作  我不信
That you would work for free. I don't trust that.

481
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,050
因为谁也不会不要报酬
Because no one works for free.

482
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,980
总统女士  恐怕我不能同意20%
Madam President, I'm afraid I can't agree to 20%.

483
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,140
-对经济的影响  -我们陷入僵局了
- The economic implications-- - We're at an impasse.

484
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,300
我很希望能继续对话  但与此同时
I'm willing to keep the conversation going, but in the meantime--

485
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,770
你们不同意  我们就不行动
We'll do nothing until you agree.

486
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,810
总统女士  会有人丧命的
Madam President, people will die.

487
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,760
所以我才惊讶你居然不同意我的条件
Which is why I'm surprised you won't agree to my terms.

488
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,830
除非外交部国务委员同意
I can't agree to the terms without the approval

489
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,520
否则我不能同意你的条件
of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs.

490
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,650
船上有112人
There are 112 people aboard the vessel.

491
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,250
要是算上彼得森先生就是113人
113 if you count Mr. Peterson.

492
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,080
20至32小时后  船就会完全沉没
Now, it will go under in 20 to 32 hours.

493
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,840
现在南冰洋的水温
The temperature of the Southern Ocean right now

494
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,430
是零下2摄氏度
is 28 degrees Fahrenheit.

495
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,560
在这么冷的水里  人不到45分钟
A body will freeze to death within 45 minutes

496
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,080
就会冻死
in water that cold.

497
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,440
更不要说在冻死之前早就失去游泳能力了
And, of course, one loses the ability to swim long before that.

498
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,320
徐部长  你还在吗
Minister Xu, are you still there?

499
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,700
和佩特罗夫总统合谋永远是个错误
Collaborating with President Petrov is always a mistake.

500
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,810
20%的关税会帮你们长长记性
The 20% tariff will help you keep that in mind.

501
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,050
我等你回复
I'm waiting.

502
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,290
这些人的死活取决于你了
It's up to you if they live or die.

503
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,090
-船员呢  -全部获救
- The crew? - All rescued.

504
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,920
撒德·彼得森呢
And Thad Peterson?

505
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,130
你猜的没错  中国人在撒谎
You were right. The Chinese were lying.

506
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,770
只有他仍然下落不明
He's the only one still unaccounted for.

507
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,040
上将说还有机会拯救那艘船
The admiral says there's still a chance to save the boat.

508
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,180
让它沉吧
Let it go down.

509
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,500
那佩特罗夫放在船上的东西呢
And whatever Petrov has on it?

510
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,390
我们这么做是对的  凯茜
We're doing the right thing, Cathy.

511
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,750
你已经达到目的了  维克多
You got what you wanted, Viktor.

512
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,490
船已经沉了  让我们接着往下谈吧
The boat is gone. Now let's get back to where we left off.

513
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,910
你想要什么  才能换艾丹·麦卡伦回国
What will it take to get Aidan Macallan back on American soil?

514
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,370
他挺喜欢这里的
He likes it here.

515
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,350
要走了吗  总统先生
Leaving, Mr. President?

516
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,810
先放车上吧  谢谢
You can put that in the car, thank you.

517
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,250
-你没事吧  -好多了
- Are you all right? - Better now.

518
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,810
你喝醉了
Are you drunk?

519
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,660
-来一口吗  -不了
- You want a pull? - No.

520
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,750
我讨厌这地方
I hate this place.

521
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,660
这些人
These men.

522
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,630
一个个仗着特权  趾高气扬
Their privilege, their presumption.

523
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,100
和塔斯克的交易就是个错误
The deal with Tusk was a mistake.

524
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,060
你知道吗
Do you know...

525
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,230
雷蒙德想把自己冻起来
Raymond wants to be frozen?

526
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,220
封进冰里  等将来再解冻
Put on ice until a later date.

527
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,900
-我要走了  -威尔·康威是我的朋友  但
- I have to get going. - Will Conway's my friend. But...

528
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,020
如果他赢了  不会有什么好结果的
this won't end well for him if he wins.

529
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,160
你照顾好自己  本
You take care of yourself, Ben.

530
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,300
他们有段他的录音
They have a recording of him.

531
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,690
我马上就过去
I'll be right there in a minute.

532
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,760
你必须向我保证
You have to promise me

533
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,800
威尔·康威绝不能知道是我给你的
Will Conway never finds out this came from me.

534
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,940
你知道我会成为总统吧
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?

535
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,650
-希望如此  先生  -你希望如此
- I hope so, sir. - You hope so?

536
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,190
我只是说我支持你  先生
I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.

537
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,440
我一定会成为总统
I'm gonna be the president,

538
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,210
你也一定要把那该死的操纵杆给我
and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.

539
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,200
先生
Sir!

540
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,730
这肯定是飞行员录的
I think this must have been recorded by the pilot.

541
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,990
我们应该先发给MSNBC和CNN
We should go to MSNBC and CNN first.

542
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,150
-我们可以大范围传播  -不  先等等
- We can go wide. - No, let's wait.

543
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,310
弗兰西斯  你也听到了
Francis, you heard what I heard.

544
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,310
所以留到明天效果一样好
And it'll be just as good tomorrow.

545
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,890
让道尔来核实  明天早上见
Have Doyle confirm it. I'll see you in the morning.

546
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,350
为什么不现在动手
Why not do it now?

547
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,340
我们要等总统回来
We need to wait for the president.

548
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,390
新闻持续关注
Stories are still swirling

549
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,620
中国在南冰洋对一艘俄考察船船员

该考察船被困在南极半岛海岸冰层

552
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,220
长达四天之久

虽然该船最终沉没  但船员全部获救
Although the ship was lost, every crew member was saved.

554
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,800
俄罗斯总统维克多·佩特罗夫

555
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,210
于今日上午向中国政府表达了由衷的感谢

556
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,020
看来两位候选人终于精力不济
Exhaustion must be catching up with the candidates,

557
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,610
安德伍德总统和他的竞选搭档周末休息
as President Underwood and his running mate took the weekend off.

558
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,820
布洛哈特将军也不知所踪
General Brockhart was nowhere to be seen,

559
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,020
只有康威州长
while only Governor Conway

560
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,080
在克利夫兰地区短暂露面了两次
made a pair of quick appearances in the Cleveland area.

561
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,760
那自来水会要你命的
That tap water is gonna kill you.

562
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,560
还有更糟的死法
There are worse ways to go.

563
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,160
我要坦白一件事
I have a confession.

564
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,760
你做了什么
What'd you do?

565
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,800
你在纽约时  我有时让人监视你
I've had somebody watch you sometimes when you go to New York.

566
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,810
她叫凯伦
Her name's Karen.

567
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,390
她是谁
Who is she?

568
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,940
我觉得你没资格问这个
I don't know you get to ask that.

569
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,500
她是我以前的老师
She was my teacher.

570
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,460
教过我神学和一些别的
Theology, among other things.

571
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,800
我不知我为什么那么做
I don't know why I did that.

572
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,810
不是因为嫉妒
It's not... about jealousy.

573
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,600
其实  她救过我的命
She saved my life, actually.

574
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,570
我很高兴
I'm glad.

575
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,970
我们短时间内不会再见到凯伦了
Well, we won't be seeing Karen for a while.

576
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,010
她懂我  她看得出我对你的感觉

577

女士  这是初步协议

578
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,640

中国和俄罗斯
Uh, the Chinese and the Russians

580
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,830
获取了一项他们不该有的技术
had access to technology they shouldn't have

581
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,260
又不想失去
and didn't want to lose.

582
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,460
现在他们失去了
And now they've lost it.

583
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,700
你有什么没告诉我的
What aren't you telling me?

584
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,830
你想从中得到什么
What did you want out of all of this?

585
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,200
我告诉过你我想要什么
I told you what I wanted.

586
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,310
我想要那美国人离开那艘船
I wanted that American off the boat.

587
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,470
他就是那项技术
He was the technology.

588
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,700
来  给我
Here, give me that.

589
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,910
走吧
Go.

590
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,960
汤姆·汉默施密特
Tom Hammerschmidt.

591
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,610
警探  我拿到盘了
Detective, I got the drive.

592
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,950
还没有  我刚放进电脑
Uh, no, I just put it in.

593
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,760
时间标识是
And... the time stamp says

594
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,180
2013年11月3日晚8:13
November 3rd, 2013, 8:13 p.m.

595
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,010
等一下
Hold on a second.

596
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,680
你没事吧
You all right?

597
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,040
没事  我要出去一下
Yeah. I just need to get out for a minute.

598
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,310
我在
I'm here.

599
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,750
我知道  我知道你忙
I know. I know you're busy.

600
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,930
感谢无以言表  我...
And I can't thank you enough, I...

601
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,330
我看看
Let me back you up a bit.

602
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,730
好  这是她死前两天的录像
Okay, so this is two days before she died.

603
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,970
州长听起来精神错乱了
The governor sounds unhinged.

604
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,430
不过我不太安心
It bothers me, though.

605
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,730
这也来得太容易了  你不觉得吗
It came too easy, don't you think?

606
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,180
是的  但如果用上它  我们就能赢
Yes, but if we use it, we'll win.

607
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,450
我不知道  克莱尔  你了解这些人
I don't know, Claire. You know these types of people.

608
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,080
你要是在场就好了
You should have been there.

609
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,340
他们为什么要给我
Why would they hand me...

610
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,440
他就那么交给我了 为什么呢
He just handed me this. Why?

611
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,640
他们从不希望我当选  从一开始就是
When they've never wanted me, not from the beginning,

612
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,080
不论我怎么做
no matter what I do!

613
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,960
-让他们见鬼去  -我正有此意
- Fuck 'em. - I intend to.

614
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,240
那你打算怎么做
And how do you intend to do that?

615
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,440
我要回来工作了
I'm going back to work.

616
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,130
我要回来工作了
I'm going back to work.

617
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,490
我们很高兴你能来
We're glad you came.

618
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,780
听说这种周末活动过后得缓上一阵
I hear those weekends can, uh, take some recovery time.

619
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,730
我得说  我没想到这么快就会再来
I must say, I didn't expect to be back here so soon.

620
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,870
马克  我们再次请你来是因为
Well, Mark, we asked you back here because...

621
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,630
我们又拿到了一份录音
we've come into possession of a second audio recording

622
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,240
是你的候选人在飞机上说的话
of your candidate on an airplane.

623
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,300
-他在录音里说...  -我知道他说了什么
- He's been recorded saying... - I know what he said.

624
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,120
我当时在场
I was there.

625
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,590
不知我们能否商讨一下
So, we were wondering if we can discuss how...

626
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,940
我们可以如何合作
we might be able to work together.

627
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,110
我们三个人能实现很多成果
We can accomplish a great deal. The three of us.

628
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,920
在你说话前
Now, before you say anything,

629
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,330
我先说说这场谈话会如何进行
let me tell you how this conversation's going to go.

630
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,170
你会说到党派忠诚
You're going to talk about party loyalty,

631
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,350
我会说你的候选人有多差劲
and I'm going to talk about how weak your candidates are

632
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,130
你其实别无选择
and that you really have no choice.

633
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,260
然后你会说你们还能赢下俄亥俄州
And then you're going to say that your ticket can still win Ohio.

634
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,200
接着我会说"不  赢不了"
And I'm going to say, "No, they can't."

635
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,230
但这场谈话中不会谈到
But what's going to go unsaid in this conversation

636
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,640
我和克莱尔
is that Claire and I...

637
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,000
愿意不惜一切
are willing... to do anything.

638
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,240
我们知道
And we know...

639
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,810
你也如此
that you are no different.

640
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:45,380
好吧  我可以先为你俩安排一些会面
Okay, I can start by setting up some meetings for both of you.

641
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,520
当然不能公开行动
I can't do that publicly, of course.

642
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,810
我建议你们慢慢抖出手上的料
I suggest you release whatever you have slowly.

643
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,690
一次一条
One at a time.

644
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,340
让事情发酵
Let's make this build.

645
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,010
消息一曝光
Once it gets out,

646
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,490
我会确保共和党人
I'll make sure the Republicans

647
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,590
不会维护我的候选人
don't come to my candidate's defense.

648
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,230
我当时的情况很糟
I was in a really bad place.

649
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,670
什么都做不了
I couldn't do anything.

650
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,890
无法离开我的公寓
I couldn't leave my apartment.

651
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
为什么
Why?

652
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,760
这种事的发生  很莫名
It's mysterious, isn't it, when these things happen?

653
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,550
或许你没遇到过
Or maybe it never happened to you.

654
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,890
但我有一天醒来  感觉好像...
But I woke up one day and it felt like...

655
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,810
我考虑要做的一切
everything I contemplated doing, everything,

656
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,840
从去咖啡店
from going to the coffee shop...

657
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,990
到看一本书  写一章书  就是很...
to... reading a book, writing a chapter, it was just...

658
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,190
可笑
laughable.

659
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,190
什么意思
As in?

660
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,370
就是  没有意义
As in... pointless.

661
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,350
但多亏了凯伦
And Karen, bless her...

662
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,990
她帮我找到了意义  不是找到
she helped me find a point. Or, not find one.

663
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,440
而是发现找到意义的可能性
Realize the possibility of one.

664
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,310
你们当时在一起吗
Were you together?

665
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,050
没错  我们还结了婚
Yeah. We were married.

666
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,140
大概三年  都是陈年旧事
For about three years. A million years ago.

667
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,490
她人很好
She's a good person.

668
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,060
她只是...现在状况不太好  所以我想帮她
She's just... having a hard time. So I'm trying to help her.

669
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,920
找到意义
Find a point?

670
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,460
你经历过那种低谷吗
You ever been that dark?

671
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,400
我想和你在一起
I wanna be with you.

672
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,310
我爱你
I love you.

673
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,780
我也许也爱你
I think I might love you, too.

674
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,570
这是30秒宣传片的稿子
That's the script for the 30-second spot.

675
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
我们不想下手太重
We don't wanna hit him too hard.

676
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,010
不然可能被当成落井下石
There's a risk of kicking him while he's down.

677
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,980
谁上晨间节目
Who's doing the morning shows?

678
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,930
朋友  他们会礼貌地质疑康威的胜任能力
Friends. They'll respectfully question Conway's ability to serve.

679
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,480
然后在晚间新闻中
And then in the nightly news,

680
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,200
会有退休军人权利活动家争取更好的医疗
we'll have veteran rights activists arguing for better care.

681
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,280
很好
Good.

682
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,390
先生  计划先打击州长
Sir, the plan is to go after the governor first,

683
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,750
等将军出面维护他
and when the general comes to his defense,

684
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,390
我们再用他抗命的录音扳倒他
we use his hot mic comments to take him down, too.

685
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,290
祝贺你  先生
Congratulations, sir.

686
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,180
我想第一个祝贺你
I wanted to be the first to say it.

687
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,090
我们还得走竞选流程
We still have to campaign.

688
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,550
没错  但您会胜选
Yeah, but you're going to win.

689
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,880
我们会的  道格
We are, Doug.

690
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,290
我们会的
We are.

691
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,790
俗世烦恼啊  散去吧
Common woe, be done.

693
00:43:37,190 --> 00:44:37,190
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}各种各样的兄弟会组织在欧美国家有着悠久的历史
其中最广为人知  同时也是同美国总统联系最多的是"共济会"
共济会成立于18世纪的英格兰  组织神秘  对会员遴选严格
会员中有许多政客  艺术家  科学家
如莫扎特  马克·吐温  发明青霉素的弗莱明等  都是共济会会员
传至美国后  同美国建国的历史一直有着千丝万缕的联系
在签署独立宣言的55人中  有9名共济会会员
而迄今为止的45任美国总统里  有15名是共济会会员  达三分之一
(其中林登·约翰逊没能完成晋级程序  未成为正式会员
所以有的统计没将他算上  认为只有14名总统真正是共济会会员)
共济会发展至今  更多是一个社交性的社会组织
但其组织严守秘密  公众对其所知甚少  因而衍生出不少骇人听闻的传说
包括这个组织怎样影响和控制了世界  其实这些说法几乎没有任何根据

695
00:44:37,190 --> 00:45:37,190
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}进入2017年后  美国媒体对俄罗斯在北极的扩张非常关注
目前普京正在对北极附近的俄罗斯军事基地
进行冷战结束后最大规模的扩张  而美国政府在这方面的动作相对落后
由于北极有着4千亿桶的原油储备  而被世界上几个大国看作战略要地
俄罗斯目前有40艘破冰船  其中6艘是核动力驱动
而美国只有2艘  其中1艘还不能工作
美国新任国防部长马蒂斯在出席自己的任命听证会时表示
美国不应该把北极的控制权拱手让给其他国家
