It's over. He owns us.

这次不一样
Yeah, well, this one is different.

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,520
-怎么不一样  -因为我能感觉到
- Why? - Because I can feel it right here.

我这是现实  不是幼稚

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,120
我们奋斗的一切成果  都会烟消云散

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,820
我们同意让厄舍来挑人  没得商量
We agreed to Usher's pick. It's non-negotiable.

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,590
说得太对了  他挑人  他的法官
That's exactly right. It's his pick. It's his justice.

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,850
他想控制我们的政府  我们的白宫
He's trying to control our house. The White House.

38
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,330
我向他保证过了  弗兰西斯
I gave him my word, Francis.

39
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,090
你保证
Your word?

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,390
你保证  这场谈话真是毫无意义
Your word? This conversation is pointless.

41

Smiling for the camera is Ahmed Al Ahmadi,

尤瑟夫的兄弟
Yusuf's brother.

53
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,120
你确定吗
Are you sure?

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,110
我和尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪谈了很久
I had a long conversation with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

55
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,720
他们俩完全不像
They look nothing alike.

56
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,500
就是他
It's him.

57
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,700
艾哈迈德还在我们监控中吗
Is Ahmed still in our sights?

58
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,130
-是的  -这个机会非常难得
- He is. - This is a rare opportunity.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,140
我们应该趁机发动定点袭击
We should seize the moment and make a targeted strike.

60
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,350
-总监  得了吧  -总统女士
- Director, please. - Madam President...

61
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,710
有什么问题吗  将军
Is there some issue, General?

62
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,240
艾哈迈德·艾哈迈迪不可能大老远地
Ahmed Al Ahmadi didn't travel all the way

63
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
从他的据点跑到大马士革就为了买糖吃
from his compound to Damascus to buy a candy bar.

64
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,250
他肯定要见什么人  我们应该查清是谁
He's meeting with someone. Let's find out who.

65
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,000
可这样他可能会被我们惊动  就此消失
Unless we're detected, and he disappears for good.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,260
可我们只要等一等
But if we wait,

67
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,160
就非常有可能了解更多哈里发国的情报
there's a huge potential to learn more about ICO.

68
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,310
它的成员  联系人  行动规律和战术
Its members, contacts, habits, tactics.

69
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,590
你今天早上真是一反常态地
You know, you're sounding uncharacteristically dovish

70
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,170
保守啊  将军
this morning, General.

71
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,260
我同意布雷格将军的看法
I agree with General Braegher.

72
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,050
虽然对艾哈迈迪发动精确空袭
While a successful air strike against Ahmadi

73
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,950
-会非常有利于  -这跟选举无关  凯茜
- would play well... - This isn't about the election, Cathy.

74
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,670
当然没关系  我是说  只要我们手段得当
No, of course not. I mean, if we do this correctly,

75
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,680
我们就可以逐步瓦解哈里发国的网络
we can begin the process of dismantling ICO's network.

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,950
干掉他
Take him out.

77
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,010
如果总统同意的话
If the president agrees,

78
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,220
我认为这对国家最有利
I think it's the best thing for the country.

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,730
我觉得这会给哈里发国发出非常明确的信号
Well, I think it would send a very clear message to ICO.

80
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,300
短期来看没错  但是
In the short term, yes, but...

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,160
短期没错就够了
No other term is relevant.

82
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,840
我觉得我们已经在
I think we have been operating

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,020
恐怖主义的阴影下忍受太久了
under the shadow of terror for too long.

84
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,870
为了美国人民  我们必须采取坚决行动
For the sake of the American people, we need to act now.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,740
预计需要多长时间  将军
What's the timetable, General?

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,420
只要目标位置准确  几个小时就行
For an actionable location, most likely a number of hours.

87
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,860
谢谢
Thank you.

88
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,250
你这是在浪费我们的时间
You're wasting our time.

89
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,370
我们要讲究他在哪以何种面貌出现
We're being selective about where and how he appears.

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,970
很快他就什么活动都不能参加了
Soon he won't be at any events at all.

91
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,400
汉娜  我们只是想尽力把他和你送入白宫
Hannal, we're just trying to land him and you in the White House.

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,550
不是布洛哈特-康威  马克  是康威在前
And it's not Brockhart-Conway, Mark. It's the opposite.

93
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,560
他肯定忍不了多久
He won't put up with this much longer.

94
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,690
我知道他一定很难受
I know, I'm sure it's hard on him.

95
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,960
我得接这个电话  抱歉
I have to take this. I'm sorry.

96
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,910
他到那儿之后会怎么样
What happens after he gets there?

97
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,200
-威尔会怎么样  -我们会支持他
- To Will? What happens? - We'll be there for him.

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
-你和布洛哈特将军  -对
- You and General Brockhart? - Yes.

99
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,230
威尔是什么角色
What will Will's role be?

100
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,470
我会继续支持你丈夫
I will continue to support your husband.

101
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,110
给我一个真正的答案  你欠我的
Give me a real answer. You owe me that.

102
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,740
他的角色将是美国总统
His role will be President of the United States.

103
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,880
麦克风还开着  布洛哈特脱口而出
The mic was still hot and Brockhart just kept talking.

104
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,210
-她是这么说的  -抗命吗
- That's what she said. - Insubordination?

105
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,010
-她用的是这个词吗  -她听着是这意思
- That's the word she used? - It's what it sounded like to her.

106
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,200
他在谈士兵  他说
He was talking about soldiers and he said, quote,

107
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,560
"我第一个站出来让军人抗命"
"I'll be the first to tell them not to listen."

108
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,460
-她能不能弄到真正的录音  -是有代价的
- Can she get her hands on the actual clip? - For a price.

109
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,070
-我还以为她是朋友  -对  聪明的朋友
- I thought she was a friend. - Yeah, a smart friend.

110
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,680
这是一条很不错的辩论后30秒广告
It's a nice 30-second spot, post-debate.

111

If there is a debate.

Hits them at their strength.

113
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,610
动摇他们的军事公信力
Takes the military credibility away.

114
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,370
这种东西能反转大选结果
This is the kind of thing that can turn an election.

115
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,280
不管要付出什么代价  都值了
Whatever this costs... it's worth it.

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,710
我们把它搞到手  证实一下
Let's secure it and then verify it.

117
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,300
不管是不是休会任命本森大法官
Recess appointment of Judge Benson or no,

118
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,970
得让人们继续关注田纳西和俄亥俄的重新投票
people need to stay focused on the revote in Tennessee and Ohio

119
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,680
以及我们为何走到这一步
and how the hell we got here.

120
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,120
好
All right.

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,390
我让助理安吉拉联系你
I'll have my assistant Angela reach out

122
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,620
看你什么时候需要我去录影棚
to confirm what time you need me at the studio.

123
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,620
好  好的
All right. Yep. Yeah.

124
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,510
我把道格·斯坦普被劫车那天
I collected everything I could find

125
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,890
能查到的资料都搜集齐了
about the day Doug Stamper was carjacked.

126
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,050
好
Good.

127
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,790
好了  那么
All right, so...

128
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,840
是在哪
where was that?

129
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,530
在哪发生的
Where that happened?

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,720
在马里兰
In Maryland.

131
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,290
就在
Right around, um...

132
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,080
我是在离那儿半小时车程的地方长大的
Yeah, I grew up about a half an hour from there...

133
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,450
在这里
It's here.

134
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,840
瑞秋·波斯纳的
And Rachel Posner's...

135
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,190
最后已知地址
last known address.

136
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,910
也就15分钟路程
I'd say they were about 15 minutes apart.

137
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,660
我不知道我为什么要跟你解释
I'm not sure why I need to explain myself to you.

138
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,100
你为什么要去国安局
Why would you go to the NSA?

139
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,970
我想调查一名美国公民是否安然无恙
I was inquiring into the well-being of an American citizen.

140
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,370
他就是个心怀不满的黑客而已
He's just a disgruntled hacker.

141
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,560
那你为什么对他这么感兴趣呢
Then why are you so interested in him?

142
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,930
他看上去怎么样
How did he look?

143
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,060
我是为了我自己问的
I'm asking for me.

144
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,970
我13岁就认识艾丹了
I've known Aidan since I was 13 years old.

145
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,230
他和我妈妈曾交往过几年
He and my mom dated for several years.

146
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,700
当然  那是很久之前了
Was a long time ago, obviously.

147
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,660
但他并不想要国安局那份工作
But as far as the NSA job, he didn't want it.

148
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,990
是我逼他接受的
I made him take it.

149
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,120
我不明白他们怎么找到他的  他为什么在那儿
I don't understand how they got him or why he's there.

150
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,730
我需要知道他是安全的
I need to know that he is safe.

151
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,750
他看上去还行
He looked fine.

152
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,100
他知道什么  莉安
What does he know, LeAnn?

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,760
也许跟你我知道的差不多
Probably about the same as you and me,

154
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,350
所以我们不能让他惹上严重的麻烦
which is why we need to keep him out of any serious trouble.

155
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,790
我不想涉足你的私生活  莉安
I don't want to get involved in your personal life, LeAnn.

156
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,510
-我是来见总统的  -当然

但你仔细想想  凯茜
But when you think about it, Cathy,

158
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,630
我们都脱不了干系
we're all sort of involved here.

159
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,830
如果他有危险  他是无法承受的
If he is in any kind of danger, he is not built for it.

160
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,190
你好  凯茜
Hi, Cathy.

161
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,100

商务部副助理部长  负责国际贸易

164
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,910
很拗口
It's a mouthful.

165
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,790
很高兴见到你本人
Yeah, it's good to put a face to the voice.

166
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,290
你有布洛芬吗
Uh, do you have any ibuprofen?

167
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,280
-我好像有阿司匹林  -不行
- Oh, I might have some aspirin. - No.

168
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,780
-我过敏  会起疹子  -我们好像有
- I'm allergic. Gives me hives. - We may have some.

169
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,390
你家就是做轮胎的哈维家族  对吧

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,610
我父亲和叔叔二十年前卖了公司
My father and uncle sold the business 20 years ago.

171
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,010
之后胎面就不一样了
And the treads haven't been the same since.

172
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,500
但很不错  你还是来到了华府

173
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,340
我会告诉总统你们俩都来了

谢谢你的药
Uh, thank you for this.

175
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,450
我们对调这两句就行了
Let's just reverse those two sentences and it's there.

176
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,810
切中要点
It's to the point.

177
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,940
-凝练  -没错  凝练
- Pithy. - Yes, pithy.

178
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,260
她们来了

183
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,360
好  让她们进来  行吗

184
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,650
好的

186
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,580
弗兰西斯不去
Francis will not be there.

187
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,670
他不必去
He's not needed.

188
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,480
戴维斯女士

189

190
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,740
-好久不见  -是啊  上次见面是在哪

191
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,150
阿斯彭一家智库  2000年初
A think tank in Aspen, early 2000.

192
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,100
那时还有很多"智慧的火花"

193
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,100
还好我们阻止了
I'm glad we put a stop to that.

194
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,140
请坐
Please, have a seat.

195
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,450

钢铁协议的草案数据
of the proposed agreement of steel with Beijing

197
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,610
我有些问题想问你
and I have a couple of questions for you.

198
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,600
总统女士  我们需要带你撤离
Madam President, we need to evacuate you now.

199
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,340
怎么回事
What's going on?

200
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,040
请撤离  总统女士  是紧急情况
Please, Madam President. It's urgent.

201
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,260
女士
Ma'am.

202
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,430
你们要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

203
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,730
-将您转移到总统紧急行动中心  -为什么
- We're moving you to the PEOC. - Why?

204
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,420
他们会在下面告诉您  女士
They'll brief you down below, ma'am.

205
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,690
弗兰西斯人呢
Where's Francis?

206
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,090
道格·斯坦普呢  还有耶茨先生呢
Where's Doug Stamper? And Mr. Yates?

207
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,640
我们在照章办事  女士
We're following protocol, ma'am.

208
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,130
国家安全顾问卡弗蒂在路上了
National Security Advisor Cafferty is on her way.

209
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,790
-女士  -不  我们等弗兰西斯
- Ma'am? - No, we'll wait for Francis.

210
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,750
他会在里面与您会合
He'll meet you inside.

211
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,990
我们要等弗兰西斯  这是命令
We will wait for Francis. That's an order.

212
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,900
-总统女士  -卡弗蒂女士  怎么回事
- Madam President. - Miss Cafferty, what's going on?

213
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,060
尚无确切消息
Nothing's confirmed yet,

214
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,420
但一辆携带放射性物质的卡车失踪了
but a truck carrying radioactive material has gone missing.

215
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,140
-这是真的吗  -我们得和格林谈谈
- Is this real? - We have to talk to Green.

216
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,500
我们进去吧
Let's head inside.

217
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,190
是
Yes.

218
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,160
我明白了  谢谢
I see. Thank you.

219
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,240
国土安全部收到网络司令部的消息
Homeland received word from Cybercom

220
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,790
一辆携带三台铯137辐照器的卡车
that a truck carrying three cesium-137 irradiators

221
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,150
未按时到达两个检查站
missed two checkpoints.

222
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,950
卡车本该从亚特兰大
It was supposed to be traveling from Atlanta

223
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,160
驶回巴尔的摩的生产厂商那里
back to the manufacturer in Baltimore.

224
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,670
卡车现在在什么位置
Where do we think the truck is now?

225
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,100
卡车的卫星定位下线了
Truck's GPS is offline.

226
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,660
怎么会出这样的破事
How the hell does a thing like that happen?

227
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,750
-我们得重新评估  -可是该重新评估了
- We'll have to reevaluate. - You're damn right we will.

228
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,440
但我们必须作出决定
But we need to make some decisions.

229
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,970
我们应该通知特区警察和弗州州警
We should notify Metro PD and Virginia State Police.

230
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,510
要不要疏散群众
Are we gonna evacuate the public?

231
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,570
不行  在采取任何行动之前
No. Before we do anything,

232
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,450
我要和反恐处局长谈一谈
I wanna speak to the head of counterterrorism.

233
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,190
给我接助理局长格林
Get Assistant Director Green on the line.

234
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,670
-女士  国安部已经  -总统说得对
- Ma'am, Homeland is over... - The president is right.

235
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,120
女士
Ma'am?

236
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,910
我是安德伍德总统
This is President Underwood.

237
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,320
眼下我们还不清楚谁对这起事件负责
At this time, we have no idea who's responsible.

238
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,500
格林局长  我最好还是
Director Green, perhaps it's better

239
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,700
把你接到免提上  请稍等
I patch you into the whole room. One second.

240
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,010
自从他的轮班开始  司机就失联了
The driver's been unreachable since his shift began.

241
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,150
卡车上的放射物
There's enough radiation on that truck

242
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,260
足够影响方圆50公里左右的区域
to impact a 30-mile radius.

243
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,930
即便不被武器化  也会扩散到大气中
Even if it's not weaponized, it would be in the air,

244
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,480
水里  影响儿童和平民
in the water, children, people...

245
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,820
将军  我在这里都能听见车轮轰轰响了
General, I can hear the wheels grinding from here.

246
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,870
最好还是不要妄加推测  先生
I'd rather not speculate, sir.

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,550
请你尽情推测一下
Oh, please do.

248
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,720
过去几天以来  哈里发国的情报越来越多
Over the past several days, there has been increased ICO chatter,

249
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,830
但这已经是新常态了
but that is the new normal.

250
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,500
我们把可能受影响区域的地图和数据发过去了
We've sent over stats and maps of potentially affected areas.

251
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,330
我真不知道哪个更可怕
I don't know what's worse.

252
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,100
是随时会炸的脏弹  还是全城人知道
A dirty bomb about to go off or what'll happen to the city

253
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,510
我们在找一枚脏弹后的反应
when they know we're looking for one.

254
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,510
-上头有谁留守  -赛斯和莉安
- Who do we have left upstairs? - Seth and LeAnn.

255
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,940
你和格林保持通信
You stay in touch with Green.

256
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,680
如果真的有脏弹
If this is a dirty bomb,

257
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,910
那局面可就彻底不一样了
then we've just entered a different world.

258
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,250
好  先生
Yes, sir.

259
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,740
好了  我们继续集中力量
All right, we need to stay focused

260
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,010
制定一份紧急疏散计划
on our contingency plan for an evacuation

261
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,250
但不要让外界察觉我们的行动
without the appearance of doing so.

262
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,480
我们需要准备实施单向...
We need to be ready to implement one way...

263
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,530
给我联系能源部的清理小队...
We need to get the cleanup team from the Energy...

264
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,060
...有权调取安保监控录像....
...whose jurisdiction it is to get the security cams...

265
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,410
没错  最终宣布后
Yes. Whenever it happens,

266
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,090
这次任命便能打破最高法院的僵局
this appointment would break the court's deadlock.

267
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,430
我们终于能继续推进这次大选了
And we would get this election going again.

268
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,530
但请大家退一步想一想
But let's step back a minute.

269
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,460
田纳西已经不重要了
Tennessee is out of the equation.

270
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,050
无论谁赢下田州  都不够取胜
Whoever wins that state, it's not enough.

271
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,630
这样就取决于最后一个州  俄亥俄州
It's come down to one state. Ohio.

272
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,100
一个州的选择  将左右
One state is about to choose

273
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,500
下一任美国总统的人选
the next President of these United States.

274
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,530
我们怎么会让这种事发生
How did we let this happen?

275
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,770
而且还不止一次
And it keeps happening.

276
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,930
这届政府一贯喜欢搞闭门政治
This is an administration that operates behind closed doors,

277
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,780
逃避公共监督
out of the public eye.

278
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,220
今天的突然推迟也是一贯的套路
Today's sudden postponement is typical.

279
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,100
玫瑰园没发表一个字的声明
With no announcement in the Rose Garden,

280
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,670
整个白宫也完全没有任何消息放出
and literally zero news coming from the White House,

281
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,680
我们不得不去想  究竟发生了什么幕后惊变
one has to wonder what is going on behind the scenes

282
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,120
才导致这次意外推迟
to cause this unexpected delay.

283
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,950
白宫的沉默  振聋发聩
The silence is deafening.

284
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,650
在这样一场旷日持久
After such a protracted,

285
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,390
令人疑惑  混乱不堪的选举之后
confusing and, frankly, chaotic election,

286
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,090
我们有权了解真相
we deserve clarity.

287
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,350
可是  又是这样
Instead, here we are again...

288
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,000
我们又被蒙在鼓里  神经紧张
left out of the loop and on the edge of our seats.

289
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,490
我希望美国人民不会习惯了这种现象
I just hope America isn't getting used to this.

290
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,540
-喂  -是我
- Hello? - Hey, it's me.

291
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,770
道格
Doug?

292
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,500
为什么没人告诉我
Why wasn't I read in?

293
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,820
-告诉你什么  -正在发生的事
- To what? - Whatever's going on.

294
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,940
如果总统躲入地堡会对我们有利
If this is gonna play for us, the president in the bunker,

295
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,510
我要知道该如何操作
I need to know how to play it.

296
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,510
有一辆运送
There's a truck carrying

297
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,850
放射性物质的货车失联了
radioactive material that's gone missing.

298
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,710
好  赛斯和我要准备一份声明吗
Okay. Should Seth and I prepare a statement?

299
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,330
-我们要说货车在哪  -不清楚
- Where are we saying the truck is? - We don't know.

300
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,930
-什么时候能找到它  -也不清楚
- When are we gonna find it? - We don't know.

301
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,020
等下  真的有事发生吗
Wait, is something really happening?

302
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,010
可能没有
Probably not.

303
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,660
-喂  -可能没有
- Hello? - Probably not?

304
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,800
那我该做些什么
What am I supposed to do?

305
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,840
-是道格吗  -是的
- Is that Doug? - Yeah.

306
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,870
我能跟他说两句吗
Can I talk to him?

307
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,840
-你能告诉我们什么  -表现如常
- Hey, what can you tell us? - Act normal.

308
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,920
继续关注情势  
Stay on point.

309
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,660
只回应正在进行的竞选活动
Comment only on the ongoing campaign.

310
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,740
我已经把他们的日程活动延期了
I've already postponed their scheduled events.

311
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,140
我们现在有危险吗
Look, are we in danger here or what?

312
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,220
我无法回答这个问题
I can't answer.

313
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,630
因为我也不知道
Because I don't know.

314
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,620
静等国安部的进一步指示吧
Await further instructions from Homeland.

315
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,070
好吧
All right.

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,590
道格  我们还要留在这儿吗
Doug, should we be here?

317
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,850
他挂了
He hung up.

318
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,970
我们在做什么
What are we doing?

319
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,150
诺拉觉得我们需要通知麦卡锡议长
Nora thinks we need to notify Speaker McCarthy.

320
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,190
我觉得现在谈政府继续运作为时尚早
I think it's too soon for a continuity of government.

321
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,720
如果我们计划撤离  需要通知国会
If we're planning an evacuation, Congress needs to be notified--

322
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,020
我说了  我觉得太早了
I said, I believe it is a bit too early.

323
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,260
总统女士  莫里森总监认为...
Madam President, Director Morrison thinks that--

324
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,870
等下  莫里森总监在哪  为什么...
Wait a minute. Where is Director Morrison? Why--

325
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,470
她选择留在国家情报总监办公室
She opted to stay at ODNI.

326
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,750
她在那里指挥行动
She's monitoring from there.

327
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,130
至少给她打个电话
Well, at least let's get her on the phone.

328
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,680
我们早该在数月前趁有机会时铲除哈里发国
We should have wiped out ICO when we had the chance.

329
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,310
我们没问你的个人意见  将军
We didn't ask for your personal opinion, General.

330
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,390
我们需要了解艾哈迈德·艾哈迈迪的最新情况
What we need is an update on the Ahmed Al Ahmadi situation.

331
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,730
是  女士  我这就去和莫里森总监确认
Yes, ma'am. I'll check with Director Morrison now.

332
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
我有一些关系
I have contacts, you know.

333
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,560
本地的私人承包商  也许能帮上忙
Private contractors in the region that might be of help.

334
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,280
你是暗示说你的联系人
Are you suggesting that your contacts

335
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,880
比联调局和国安局知道得还多吗
know more than the Bureau, the NSA--

336
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,690
我没有暗示什么
I'm not suggesting anything.

337
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,910
我是在告诉你
I'm telling you.

338
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,390
我认识和哈里发国谈判过的第三方人士
I know third parties that have negotiated with ICO in the past.

339
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,870
人质之类的事  他们也许知道点什么
Hostages and whatnot... who may know something.

340
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,470
但我需要打个电话
But I need a line.

341
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,260
保密电话
Just a... a secure one.

342
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,520
我在这儿都快透不过气了
I can barely breathe in here.

343
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,520
我去给咱们倒杯咖啡
I'm gonna go get us a cup of coffee.

344
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,260
戴维斯女士怎么会有这么高的安全等级
How does Miss Davis have this level of clearance?

345
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,190
这值得探究
That's a good question.

346
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,490
-我们是不是自作自受  -什么
- Did we bring this on ourselves? - What?

347
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,740
-对不起  我不该这么说的  -听我说
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. - Listen to me.

348
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
我们所做的一切  一切  
Everything we've done, everything,

349
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,890
都是我们必须做的
is exactly what we had to do.

350
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,920
我们都还不知道这是不是真的
We don't even know if this is real.

351
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,580
这是我在香港买的
I get these in Hong Kong.

352
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,990
最好喝的速溶咖啡出自环太平洋地区
The best instant coffee comes out of the Pacific Rim.

353
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,430
-你想来一杯吗  -如果你还有多的
- Would you like one? - If you can spare it.

354
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,400
我包里总是装着三四包
Oh, I always have three or four in my bag.

355
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,170
不知我们要在这里待多久
I wonder how long we'll be down here.

356
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,950
目前情势还不明朗
The situation's still unclear.

357
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,990
我不该喝咖啡的  我还有点站不稳
I shouldn't be drinking coffee. I still feel a little shaky.

358
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,810
你看起来还好
You don't look it.

359
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,590
摸摸我的脉搏
Feel my pulse.

360
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,100
我看你很自若
You seem very much in control to me.

361
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,990
你也是
So do you.

362
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,230
这说明了我们什么
What does that say about the two of us?

363
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,420
好的  谢谢
Yes, thank you.

364
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,980
海豹突击队正在追踪艾哈迈德·艾哈迈迪
The SEAL team is on the trail of Ahmed Al Ahmadi,

365
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,800
但是国家情报局认为
but National Intelligence believes

366
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,680
他发现我们在追踪他了
he's discovered we're following him

367
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,690
而那卡车正是对策
and the truck is a countermeasure.

368
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,290
哈里发国想看到艾哈迈迪完好地走出大马士革
ICO wants to see Ahmadi walking out of Damascus in one piece.

369
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,470
如果我们袭击  他们会反攻
If we strike, they will hit back.

370
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,150
需要启动首都撤离程序
Capital-wide evacuation procedures need to be initiated--

371
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,150
-等等  -我们得首要考虑民众
- Just hold on! - No, the public is our priority--

372
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,790
等等  我想知道袭击的可能性有多大
Hold on! I want to know how close we are to a strike

373
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,200
以及这辆该死的卡车在哪里
and where this goddamn truck is

374
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,710
然后我们再做最后的决定
before we make any final decisions.

375
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,720
"我们再做最后的决定"
"We make any decisions"?

376
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,750
没错  我仍然是
Yes, I am still in a position to make--

377
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,960
如果我错了就纠正我  但你不是
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are not in a position--

378
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,390
诺拉  敌人不在这里
Nora. The enemy isn't in here.

379
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,540
卡弗蒂说得对  我们应该撤离
Cafferty is right. We should evacuate.

380
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,840
但我想的是将军
But it's the general who's on my mind.

381
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,600
卡弗蒂女士
Miss Cafferty.

382
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,700
我完全失态了  请接受我的道歉
I was entirely out of line. Please accept my apology.

383
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,420
我和戴维斯谈过了
I spoke with Davis.

384
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,730
-怎样  -一无所获  她只是在耍滑头
- And? - Nothing. She was just flexing.

385
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,820
凯茜
Cathy.

386
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,260
今天是谁安排了和克莱尔的会议
Who called a meeting with Claire today?

387
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,280
你还是戴维斯女士
You or Miss Davis?

388
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,500
是简
Jane did.

389
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,250
非常感谢  凯茜
Thank you very much, Cathy.

390
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,330
-没事了吗  -是的  谢谢
- Was that all? - Yes, thank you.

391
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,170
抱歉  还有一件事
Oh, sorry, one more thing.

392
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,340
布雷格什么时候得到第四颗星的  哪届政府
When did Braegher get his fourth star? Which administration?

393
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,680
几届前
A couple back.

394
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,130
他和布洛哈特是一起的吗
So he and Brockhart together?

395
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,850
是的  还有几位也在大概同一时期晋升
And a few others who were elevated around the same time, yes.

396
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,300
谢谢  凯茜
Thank you, Cathy.

397
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,800
我们谈过的那个布洛哈特的料  你拿到了吗
That Brockhart spot we talked about. You have it?

398
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,810
证实了吗
Is it verified?

399
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,530
等等
Hold on.

400
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,330
好了
Ready.

401
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,510
我对天发誓
I swear to God,

402
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,470
要是安德伍德往边境派兵
if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,

403
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,490
我第一个站出来让军人抗命
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.

404
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,050
如果美国总统下达那种命令
If the President of the United States gives orders like that,

405
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,820
你就让他早死早超生
you put him out of his misery.

406
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,680
没了  这是全部
That's it. That's all I have.

407
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,390
不  这很好
No, that's good.

408
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,210
如果我们撑过了今天
If we survive the day.

409
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,140
赛斯还和你在办公室吗
Is Seth still in the office with you?

410
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,750
我在总统办公室  坐在坚决桌后
I'm in the Oval, sitting behind the Resolute desk.

411
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,110
你不会的
That's not you.

412
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,960
你总是对我下判断
You know, you keep deciding who I am

413
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,920
却总是误判我
and you keep reading me wrong.

414
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,450
有关于这里发生了什么的谣言吗
Are there rumors about what's going on down here?

415
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,060
有  但我们在应付了
Yes, but we're deflecting.

416
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,220
-康威竞选团队来问过吗  -还没有
- Has the Conway campaign reached out? - Not yet.

417
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,790
将军在俄亥俄州做巡回宣传  州长断联了
The general's on a stump in Ohio and the governor's off the grid.

418
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,270
-好的  继续留意他  -我会的
- Okay. Stay on him. - I will.

419
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,950
除非是世界末日  那就没关系了
Unless it's the end of the world and it doesn't matter.

420
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,900
再见  道格·斯坦普
Goodbye, Doug Stamper.

421
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,730
你确定你该进去那里吗  金发姑娘
Are you sure you should be in there, Goldilocks?

422
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,070
你还好吗
Are you all right?

423
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,860
坦白说  我在想我们在地下多深
Honestly, I was thinking about how far down we are

424
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,640
以及我不喜欢这样
and how it's not my favorite thing.

425
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,000
对不起  你需要进来吗
I... I'm sorry. Do... do you need to be in here?

426
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
不不  没关系
No. No, no. It's fine.

427
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,930
我曾经害怕飞行  后来克服了
I used to have a fear of flying, but I got over it.

428
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,720
现在再也不怕了
Doesn't bother me at all anymore.

429
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,440
但我的恐惧似乎转向了另一个方向
But the pendulum seems to have swung the other way.

430
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,710
如果我想太多  会开始有活埋感
If I think too hard, I start to feel buried.

431
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,580
不好意思  室内空气循环让我更加不安了
Forgive me. It's the recirculated air, makes things worse.

432
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,660
戴维斯女士  你为什么会来这儿
Miss Davis, why are you here?

433
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,400
-特勤局带我来的  -不
- This is where the Secret Service led me. - No.

434
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,090
不管是否在准入名单上  你必定是自愿来的
Access list or not, you have to choose to be here.

435
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,960
我总是选择最安全的地方
I always choose the safest place.

436
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,510
你为什么会来这儿
Why are you here?

437
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,110
感觉有机可寻
It felt like an opportunity.

438
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,550
会面的机会  私下会面
A chance for a meeting, not quite on the books.

439
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,510
我刚通完电话  总统女士
I just got off the phone, Madam President.

440
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,450
我有来自国外私人承包商的信息
I have information from abroad, from private contractors...

441
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,210
艾哈迈迪在大马士革
Ahmadi is in Damascus.

442
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,220
多方势力竞相要捉住他
And a number of parties were racing to capture him,

443
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,880
其中当然包括美国
including, of course, the United States.

444
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,360
但是没有人
But no one...

445
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,720
能在今天逮住他
will be capturing him today.

446
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,470
或是在选举前逮住他
Or before the election.

447
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,050
我的职业
I've made a career...

448
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,750
就是处理世界的问题地区
out of dealing with problematic parts of the world.

449
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,760
我的工作  就是想象不可想象之事
It's kind of my vocation to imagine the unimaginable.

450
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,600
失陪了
Excuse me.

451
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,570
-抱歉  -抱歉
- Pardon me. - I'm sorry.

452
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,580
-没事  -失陪了  总统先生
- It's all right. - Excuse me, Mr. President.

453
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,660
我感觉她想把艾哈迈迪献给我们
I had the distinct feeling she was offering Ahmadi to us.

454
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,670
意思是
Meaning?

455
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,720
她说有多方势力正在设法捉住他
She said there are a number of groups looking to capture him,

456
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,620
但在选举之前都不会有人成功
but that no one will. Not today or before the election.

457
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,440
这是我们自找的
We brought this on ourselves.

458
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,430
-我们逼得太紧  -我们存活下来了
- We pushed too hard. - We've survived.

459
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,310
-我们自我孤立了  弗兰西斯  -又如何
- We isolated ourselves, Francis. - So what?

460
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,960
你我都明白一件
We both know something

461
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,720
其他人拒绝承认的事
the rest of the world refuses to acknowledge.

462
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,710
世上没有正义  唯有征服
There is no justice, only conquest.

463
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,390
我告诉你  我们要是准许他们疏散华盛顿
And let me tell you, we let them evacuate D.C.,

464
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,110
我们就没戏了 克莱尔  我们就输了 
we are done, Claire. We've lost.

465
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,750
请进
Yes?

466
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,250
我刚和莉安通了话  你们得听听
I just spoke to LeAnn. You need to hear this.

467
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,980
我对天发誓
I swear to God,

468
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,870
要是安德伍德往边境派兵
if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,

469
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,930
我第一个站出来让军人抗命
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.

470
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,150
如果美国总统下达那种命令
If the President of the United States gives orders like that,

471
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,100
你就让他早死早超生
you put him out of his misery.

472
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,520
让我出去
Let me out.

473
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,970
-很抱歉  先生  我不能...  -开门
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm not allowed-- - Open the door.

474
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,380
-我奉命...  -我已经不是总统 
- My orders are to-- - I am no longer the president.

475
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,640
我已无义务或责任在身  是不是
I have no responsibilities or obligations. Isn't that correct?

476
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,490
解除威胁前我们不能让你出去
We can't send you above until the threat is contained--

477
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,930
-把门打开  -让他出去
- Open this door. - Let him out.

478
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,300
-女士  -让总统出去
- Ma'am? - Let the president out.

479
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,690
把门打开
Open the door.

480
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,690
打开
Open it.

481
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,540
总统女士
Ma'am.

482
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,700
我们必须开始疏散
We need to initiate evacuation now.

483
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,220
不  将军  我说疏散才疏散
No, General. We'll do it when I say so.

484
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,530
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

485
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,900
我知道我答应你了  但我得去接我小孩
I know I agreed to do this, but I have to go pick up my kids.

486
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,570
没事  要不我搭你的车
Okay. Well, what if I just rode in the car with you?

487
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,300
家长都在互相发信息
You know, parents are texting one another.

488
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,840
其中一位家长在国安局任职
One of them works at the NSA

489
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,330
他认为有恐袭的可能  所以...
and he thinks there's a terror threat, so...

490
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,620
这事以前也发生过  但...世事难料
I mean, this has happened before, but you just... You never know.

491
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,490
我母亲上个月肾衰竭过世了
My mom died of kidney failure last month.

492
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,240
我很遗憾
Oh, I'm so sorry.

493
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,010
她在候捐名单上吗
Uh, was she on the donor list?

494
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,080
有  但排得不够靠前
Yeah, but not close enough to the top.

495
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,520
你介意吗  我们可以边走边说
Do you mind? You could talk while we walk out of here.

496
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,450
好吧  好
Sure. Yeah.

497
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,210
安东尼病了多久了
Uh, how long was Anthony sick for?

498
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,160
大概两年
About two years.

499
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,750
他一直在抗争  非常顽强  直到最后
And he fought it hard. So hard. The entire way.

500
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,340
这地方  只要是现金支付  我就不多问
This unit, if they pay cash, I don't ask questions.

501
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,600
-但你记得那两个年轻女子吧  -当然
- But you remember these young women? - Yeah, of course.

502
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,390
她们非常亲密  如果你明白我的意思
They were very close, if you know what I mean.

503
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,820
但她们很可爱
But they were sweet.

504
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,070
那你有没有见过这个人
And did you ever see... this man?

505
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
我不清楚究竟是怎么回事
Look, I don't know what was going on here.

506
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,700
但你认得他吧
But you recognize him?

507
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,580
认得
Yeah. Okay?

508
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,030
是有一个长这样的人预付了三个月房租
Someone looking like him paid the rent. Three months, up-front.

509
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,390
但我说了  我不做评判
But like I said, I don't judge.

510
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,960
我不明白你问的是什么  总统先生
I'm not sure what you're asking, Mr. President.

511
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,010
得了吧
Oh, please.

512
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,510
某个人或者某些人
Someone or someones...

513
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,600
今天想把我和我夫人困在地下
tried to make my wife and I lose the election

514
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
好让我们输掉大选
by keeping us underground today.

515
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,600
我想知道你对此有什么了解
And I would like to know what you know about that.

516
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,350
我们都在实时应对
We've all been responding in real time

517
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,190
一起潜在的恐怖袭击
to a potential terrorist attack.

518
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,910
但你选择待在这里
But you chose to stay here.

519
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,950
你怎么不和我们一起去地堡
Why weren't you in the bunker with us?

520
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,010
我选择留在我的办公室
I chose to remain in my office

521
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,370
监督对艾哈迈德·艾哈迈迪的逮捕或击杀
to oversee the capture or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.

522
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,730
但今天上午  你和布雷格将军
And yet there was great tension this morning

523
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,750
闹得很紧张
between you and General Braegher.

524
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,460
见解不同
Difference in approach.

525
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,110
我们不会疏散哥伦比亚特区的
We are not going to evacuate the District of Columbia.

526
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,640
我要你明白这一点  无论如何
I want you to understand that. Come what may.

527
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,790
另外我向你保证  凡妮莎
And I promise you this... Vanessa.

528
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,100
等我查明真相
When I find out exactly what has happened,

529
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,820
我会记得这次对话
I'm going to remember this conversation,

530
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,230
我会记得  你选择了隐瞒信息
when you chose to withhold information.

531
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,730
布雷格将军是布洛哈特将军的强烈支持者
General Braegher is a strong supporter of General Brockhart.

532
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,170
他们串通了吗
Did they conspire?

533
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,540
他们是不是想利用恐怖
Did they use... terror...

534
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,330
和此次疏散
and this evacuation

535
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,750
让我输掉这场大选
to cost me this election?

536
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,200
我并不喜欢将军这个人
I'm not a fan of the general...

537
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,700
但这是个严重的指控
but... that's a strong charge,

538
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,370
而且没有任何证据支撑
and there's no proof to support it.

539
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,630
你们这些人最擅长保护的  是彼此
You know, what you people protect best is each other.

540
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,130
艾哈迈迪不久前没了踪迹
We lost Ahmadi a short time ago

541
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,620
我们相信他已经不在大马士革了
and believe he is no longer in Damascus.

542
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,250
当然了
Of course.

543
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,960
当然了
Of course.

544
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,190
你听好了
Now you listen to me...

545
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,380
这就是一次
This was nothing more or less

546
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,030
明明白白的政变未遂  
than an attempted coup, plain and simple.

547
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,920
我不知道你直接参与的程度多深
And I do not know to what degree you have been directly involved.

548
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,040
但你必须化解它
But you will resolve it.

549
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,110
立即化解
Now.

550
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,680
听明白了吗
Do I make myself clear?

551
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,960
明白了  先生
Yes, sir.

552
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,480
卡车找到了
The truck's been found.

553
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,380
我们还不确定
Now we can't know for sure,

554
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,020
但似乎哈里发国没有参与其中
but it looks as though ICO wasn't involved.

555
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,480
辐照器和铯都已找到
The irradiators and cesium were accounted for.

556
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,790
卡车偶然停在了
The truck was accidentally parked

557
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,140
达勒姆的一处医疗设备厂
at a medical device factory in Durham.

558
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,940
工头没有上报
The plant foreman never reported it.

559
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,180
所以我们暂时可以松口气了
So we can relax for now, at least.

560
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,760
感谢大家的付出  谢谢你们
I just wanna thank you all for your efforts. Thank you.

561
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,920
总统女士  我明天一早就递交辞呈
Madam President. You'll have my resignation in the morning.

562
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,240
诺拉
Nora...

563
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,080
今天这是极端情况
these were extraordinary circumstances today.

564
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,630
如果我们丝毫不容忍人为疏忽
What would our administration be

565
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,060
那我们政府成什么了
if we didn't allow for some human failings?

566
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,020
准备发布会  我们马上上去
Get the presser going. We're coming up now.

567
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,560
关于艾哈迈迪
Concerning Ahmadi...

568
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,690
我们没找到他
We didn't find him.

569
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,350
会找到的  你们可以的
You will. You can.

570
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,540
-你有什么提议  -我可以帮忙
- What are you offering? - Help.

571
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,850
如果您愿意  总统女士
If you'd like it, Madam President.

572
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,930
你能详细说明一下今天早些时候的演习吗
Can you elaborate on the drill earlier today?

573
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,640
演习时常进行
Well, drills happen all the time.

574
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,790
这是政府为了保证国家安全
It's part of the administration's ongoing efforts

575
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,840
做的不懈努力
to keep the country safe.

576
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,610
-是  但通常都会提前提醒  -那意义何在
- Yes, but there's usually a warning. - What's the point of that?

577
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,640
-下一位  -赛斯
- Who's next? - Seth.

578
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,930
你看档案了吗
Did you look at the file?

579
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,430
不用看
I didn't have to.

580
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,470
我希望一小时内
I'll expect your signature

581
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,840
收到你签名的辞职信
on the resignation letter within the hour.

582
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,450
除非你选择指出其他涉事的人
Unless you choose to implicate whoever else was involved.

583
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,790
你不配入主白宫
You don't deserve to be in the White House.

I'd wish you the best, but I don't think you'll need it.

凯茜对艾丹·麦卡伦非常好奇

我已经转移了她的视线  但...

00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,090
凯茜不是问题  而是麦卡伦
Cathy's not the problem. The problem is Macallan,

593
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,260
还有那个纵容麦卡伦成为问题的人

可我等得不想再等了
but I've waited and I don't want to wait anymore.

609
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,140
帮我留意下白宫的工作吧  在新闻部
Consider me for a job at the White House, in comms.

I'm tired of it.

612
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,780
你不提出  就会被人命令
If you don't ask, you get asked.

613
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,300
我开始意识到这点了
That's what I'm starting to realize.

614

我会帮你推荐的
I'll put a word in.

是吗  这话什么意思

616
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,920
意思是时机合适的话  我会提及你

617
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,490
没错  最终宣布后
Yes, whenever it happens...

618
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,240
这次任命便能打破最高法院的僵局
this appointment would break the court's deadlock

619
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,640
我们终于能继续推进这次大选了

620
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,310
但请大家退一步想一想

-无论谁赢下田州  -水池右边

Ohio.

一个州的选择  将左右
One state is about to choose

626

00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,450
那真是演习吗
Was it really a drill?

628
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,410
这届政府一贯喜欢搞闭门政治
This is an administration that operates behind closed doors.

629

知道吗  今天发生了那么多事

她有一种气质  对吧

641

都是
Both.

最初的地堡被认为是在富兰克林·罗斯福时期建造的
在冷战时  艾森豪威尔总统在国会协助下修建了更多的地堡
这些足以抵御核武器袭击的秘密地堡  其数量  地点均属于国家机密
但几十年来  媒体不断搜集蛛丝马迹  确认应该有40个左右这样的地堡
大部分位于首都华盛顿周围100英里内的山区
这些地堡除了异常坚固之外  有的面积也非常大  可以临时充作空军基地
白宫作战室位于白宫西厢的地下室
而用于藏身的总统紧急行动中心(PEOC)则位于东厢的生活区下面
2011年奥巴马在任时期  椭圆办公室后院曾大兴土木
对外称是空调及电路维修  但很多媒体猜测可能是在扩建地堡
