The cause is still under investigation.

152
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,630
-我去露个脸  -是  夫人
- I'll make an appearance. - Yes, ma'am.

153
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,650
加在日程里  让媒体有时间出动
Just put it on the schedule so the media has time to mobilize.

154
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,510
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,490
总统对约书亚·马斯特森宣战了吧
I take it the president has declared war on Joshua Masterson.

156
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,610
他就不该不让我继续参加通话
He never should've kicked me off that call.

157
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,150
但今天早晨的重点不是政治
But this morning isn't about politics.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,790
是啊
That's right.

159
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,380
我们得对生者表示同情
We need to show some compassion for the living.

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,000
对死者表示尊重
And respect for the dead.

161
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,800
他们一家答应了短暂见面
The family's agreed to a moment.

162
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,020
没有媒体  不做讲话  但我们应该能做点什么
No press, no speeches, but we should be able to pull something.

163
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,250
-总统先生  -州长
- Mr. President. - Governor.

164
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,670
他们不知道我们已经为他们做了什么吗
Do they not realize what we've done for them already?

165
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,590
这我说了  先生  但是
I pointed that out, sir, but...

166
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,150
他们家的女儿服了药  目前很脆弱
the daughter's medicated and very fragile at the moment.

167
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,970
好吧
All right.

168
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,120
米勒太太
Mrs. Miller.

169
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,720
-我非常遗憾  -谢谢

171
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,920
我绝不会罢休
I will not stop

172
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,150
除非所有导致了这场惨剧的人
until everyone responsible for this terrible tragedy

173
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,680
都受到裁决
is brought to justice.

174
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,920
我发誓  上帝为证
And I swear to you, as God is my witness...

175
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,920
再不会有人伤害你和你的家人了
no one will ever harm you or your family ever again.

176
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,070
举国与你和你女儿同哀  米勒太太
The nation mourns with you and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.

177
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,010
-谢谢  如果你不介意  -当然
- Thank you. If you don't mind... - Of course.

178
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,300
总统先生
Mr. President.

179
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,610
我就来
I'll be right along.

180
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,440
你今天很忙  先生
It's a busy day for you today, sir.

181
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,040
今天很悲伤
It's a sad, sad day.

182
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,100
很遗憾结果是这样
It's a shame things didn't turn out differently.

183
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,300
是啊  有些事比我们俩重要  威尔
Yes. Well, some things are bigger than the two of us, Will.

184
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,560
我不希望他在场
I don't want him here!

185
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,360
冷静  梅莉莎  求你
Calm down, Melissa. Please.

186
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,750
都怪他  他死了
It's his fault. He's dead.

187
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,520
-爸爸死了  他杀了他  -求你
- Daddy's dead. He killed him. - Please.

188
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,230
给我点时间
Give me a minute.

189
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,310
-你吃药了吗  -吃了  好吗
- Did you take your medicine? - Yes. Okay?

190
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,440
吃了  吃了
Yes. Yes!

191
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,090
在今天这样的日子  你会去想  该说什么
You do. You think about what you would say on a day like today.

192
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,130
如果今天这样的日子出现
If a day like today were to happen.

193
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,230
但你会让它过去
But you let it pass...

194
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,040
因为你知道  你未来还有漫长的人生
because you know you have so much more left ahead of you.

195
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,250
有很多事可以一起做
So much to do together.

196
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,650
你会想  你想40分钟
You think... You think 40 minutes...

197
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,620
如果我们迟了40分钟
If we were late 40 minutes...

198
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,670
或是两分钟  哪怕一分钟
Or two, or one...

199
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,110
或是我们当时去了别处吃饭
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...

200
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,420
但沉湎过去  活在假设里
But to dwell in the past, to live in what-ifs...

201
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,720
那不是我丈夫的为人
That wasn't my husband.

202
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,870
那不是我们
That wasn't us...

203
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,770
-亲爱的  -求你
- Honey... - Please.

204
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,540
好  来吧
Okay. Come on.

205
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,340
我得
I need to...

206
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,510
我想说说我父亲
I wanted to say about my father...

207
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,710
他是那么坚强  那么勇敢
He was so strong... so brave.

208
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,410
我父亲本打算带我们去
My father was taking us to...

209
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,960
我父亲
My father...

210
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,250
-没事  宝贝  没事的  -我父亲
- Come on, baby. It's okay. - My father...

211
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,970
你杀了我父亲  他是因为你才死的
You killed my father. You're the reason he died.

212
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,490
梅莉莎
Melissa...

213
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,960
没事的  梅莉莎  我们理解
It's all right, Melissa. We understand.

214
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,440
我希望你死  而她当上总统
I hope you die and she becomes president.

215
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,170
那女孩对你说了什么
What did the girl say to you?

216
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,960
她说她希望我死  而你当上总统
She said she hopes I die and that you become the president.

217
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,820
麦卡伦先生  我是国安局副局长迈克尔斯
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.

218
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,790
我就在你办公室  我们安排了会面
I'm literally in your office. I believe we had a meeting.

219
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,240
从北到南已经展开了大范围搜索
There's been raids as far up as New York and down to the panhandle.

220
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,540
到目前为止
As of now,

221
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,480
格林主要在搜索
Green's focusing in on the

222
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,210
弗吉尼亚和北卡罗来纳的交界处
border between Virginia and North Carolina.

223
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,930
赛斯为今天下午的事准备好了声明
Seth has a statement ready for this afternoon.

224
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,920
不  最好的声明就是不做声明
No. The best statement is no statement.

225
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,650
再说  我们准备好前
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice on this

226
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,260
我要克莱尔来就此事发声
until we're ready.

227
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,390
是  先生
Yes, sir.

228
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,370
-外面人好多  -我们最好先让博奇进来
- Quite a crowd out there. - Well, we better bring Birch in first.

229
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,360
是  先生
Yes, sir.

230
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,220
博奇议员
Congressman Birch.

231
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,730
鲍勃
Bob.

232
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,130
今早的事能载入史册了  是吧
Well, that was a little bit of history this morning, wasn't it?

233
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,650
-可不是呢  -我看不出有别的办法
- It certainly was. - I couldn't see it any other way.

234
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,970
我也同意
No disagreement from here.

235
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,750
你了解共和党的
Well, you know how the Republicans are.

236
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,240
优柔寡断
Anything but a decision.

237
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,060
他们错把抱怨当做了领导
They mistake complaint for leadership.

238
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,930
现在没有调查你的委员会了
Well, instead of a committee to investigate you,

239
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,520
而是成立了讨论宣战的委员会
you got one to discuss your declaration.

240
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,310
直到选举日
All the way to election day.

241
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,390
哪怕有那么一小撮
Even if there's only a handful

242
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,200
有勇气和决心敢抵抗的共和党人
of Republicans with the grit and spit to put up a fight,

243
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,810
我们都能控制舆论
we can control the conversation.

244
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,620
让他们谈什么都好  就是别谈那篇文章
Get them talking about anything but that goddamn article.

245
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,500
好了  我们这边
All right. Now, who from our side

246
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,490
-得去安抚谁  -乌麦克
- do we need to massage? - Womack.

247
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,790
那声明让他措手不及  得让他别掺和
The declaration caught him off guard. Had to keep him out of it.

248
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,480
是他的选民真要去打仗
It's his constituents that actually fight the damn thing.

249
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,700
请尊敬的密苏里州议员进来吧
Well, let's call in the honorable gentleman from Missouri.

250
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,540
-他喜欢波本吧  -是的
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he? - Yes, he is.

251
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,320
噱头  是的  我说这是噱头
A stunt. Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.

252
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,760
查理  容我说
Charlie, if I may...

253
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,710
汤姆  请说说  你什么意思
Tom, please, what are you implying?

254
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,520
这宣战请求不过又是在分散注意力
This request for a declaration of war is yet another distraction.

255
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,580
我从未像今天这样为总统自豪
And I've never been prouder of the president than I am today.

256
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,350
我不是在否认米勒一家的遭遇  那是个惨剧
I'm not denying what happened to the Millers. It was a tragedy.

257
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,440
不  你在否认  否认它就是惨剧
No, but you are. Because denying it is the tragedy.

258
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,900
这是个规律
This is a pattern.

259
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,680
你丈夫的政府  安德伍德夫人
Your husband's administration, Mrs. Underwood,

260
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,380
-继续在暗箱操作  -汤姆
- continues to operate in the shadows. - Tom...

261
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,190
我知道你相信你的文章很重要
I understand you believe in the importance of your article.

262
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,040
我答应今天来跟你谈谈它
And I agreed to come here today and talk with you about it.

263
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,290
但我们正在奋力保护国家的安全
But we're fighting to keep this country safe.

264
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,700
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood,

265
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,890
白宫尚未发表任何关于
the White House has yet to release one piece of information

266
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,770
抓捕那些国内恐怖分子的情况
about the attempted capture of those domestic terrorists.

267
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,580
哈里发国恐怖分子  是的
ICO terrorists, yes.

268
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,930
据几小时前的报告称
Reports from a few hours ago

269
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,520
是在北卡罗来纳或弗吉尼亚州
are saying North Carolina or Virginia.

270
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,080
但目前也只有这些
But that's all we have.

271
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,250
我们在慢慢收紧包围圈
Well, we are circling in, we're getting closer.

272
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,880
我告诉你
I will tell you,

273
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,050
我们的情报部门  是真正的英雄
our intelligence community, they are the real heroes.

274
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,010
查理  请回到我的点上  我的消息源确认
Charlie, if we could get back to my point, my sources confirmed--

275
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,910
汤姆
Tom.

276
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,140
海瑟·邓巴  她不是我或我丈夫的朋友
Heather Dunbar, no friend of mine or my husband's,

277
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,550
调查过这些指控  但宣布总统无罪
looked into these charges, and cleared the president.

278
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,900
无罪  得了吧
Cleared? Please.

279
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,710
白宫自《先驱报》刊登了我的文章
The White House has not had a single press briefing

280
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,100
就没举行过一次新闻发布会
since the Herald ran my article.

281
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,870
你总说白宫不就此事发言
You keep saying the White House isn't speaking about this.

282
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,080
但我正坐在这里跟你说话
I am sitting right here talking to you.

283
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,980
不是雷米·丹顿或杰姬·夏普
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.

284
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,840
也不是卢卡斯·古德温
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.

285
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,980
-什么  -什么意思  卢卡斯·古德温
- What? - Excuse me. Lucas Goodwin, meaning?

286
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,210
我是说  我  我在这儿
I'm saying, me. I'm here.

287
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:30,000
我不知道这些话我们还要说多少遍
And I don't know how many more times we have to go over this.

288
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,650
汤姆·汉默施密特的文章以前
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt article used to be

289
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,460
是我打开《华盛顿先驱报》后
the first thing I would look for

290
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,680
第一个要找的东西
when I opened the Washington Herald.

291
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,590
安德伍德夫妇停止了竞选宣传
The Underwoods are no longer campaigning.

292
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,680
他们想怎么说怎么说
They can call it what they want.

293
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,830
如果你想想过去的几天  想想现在的气氛
Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air...

294
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,210
或许我们慢慢来
It might not be such a bad idea for us to

295
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,780
也不是坏事
take it one handshake at a time.

296
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,730
或者实话实说
Or call it for what it is.

297
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,870
"国内和国外"
"Home and abroad."

298
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,390
总统基本上在要求许可
The president is essentially asking for permission

299
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,640
在我们的国土上打仗
to fight a war on our soil.

300
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,080
我们不能太强烈反对
We can't push back too hard.

301
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,570
我们不能显得好像对恐怖主义手软
We can't afford to look soft on terror.

302
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,440
我们也不能视而不见
We can't look the other way, either.

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,880
你最清楚这样的话会带来的结果
You of all people know where this kind of talk leads.

304
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,060
哈里发国和美利坚合众国
...ICO and the United States of America.

305
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,110
确保处理宣战的委员会
Make sure the committee dealing with the declaration of war

306
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,700
不会进入表决
never gets to a vote.

307
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,810
我们不反对战争  我们反对他的战争
We're not against war, we're against his.

308
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,980
我要你联络议长
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker

309
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,140
查明她要安排谁进入那个委员会
and find out who she's putting on that committee.

310
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,280
我们得回到总统罪行的问题上
We need to get back to the president's crimes.

311
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,910
那才是新闻  唯一的新闻
That's the story. It's the only story.

312
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,250
还有别的吗
Anything else?

313
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,530
我有我的稿子
I have my script.

314
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,940
我不会退让
I will not yield!

315
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,030
我不会
I will not...

316
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,050
哈里
Harry...

317
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,790
我想知道他说了什么  什么时候说的
I want to know what he says and when he says it.

318
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,390
将军可不习惯接受命令
Our general isn't used to taking orders.

319
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,160
威尔  还有
Will, one more thing.

320
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,590
-怎么了  -你妻子
- What? - Your wife.

321
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,450
我知道我们在波利跳上展开了宣传
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign on Pollyhop,

322
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,280
但或许该中止了
but it might be time to close it down...

323
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,490
或至少也该小心点
or at least be more careful.

324
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,390
他们查到了什么
Well, what did they find out?

325
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,380
他们在找的那名
The home of the mother of the terrorist,

326
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,860
恐怖分子的母亲家
you know, the one they're looking for,

327
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,690
昨晚遭人破坏
was vandalized last night.

328
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,020
车库被烧  窗户被打破
Garage set on fire. Broken windows.

329
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,900
汉娜
And, uh, Hannah...

330
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,640
她发了视频
well... she posted.

331
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,840
她在网上维护了那位母亲
She was defending the mother online.

332
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,990
-什么时候  -今天下午
- When? - This afternoon.

333
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,100
这个时机可不妙
The timing is not good on this.

334
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,580
-我给你看  -等会儿的
- I can show you. - Not now.

335
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,370
谢谢
Thank you.

336
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,200
康威州长和我很荣幸能来
Governor Conway and I are honored to be here

337
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,330
陪伴米勒一家和他们的亲友
with the Miller family and their closest friends.

338
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,860
我知道海外退伍军人协会
I know the VFW

339
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,440
是吉姆在诺克斯维尔生活的重要部分
was a big part of Jim's life here in Knoxville.

340
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,210
在国土安全部和我们热线的帮助下
With the help of Homeland and our hotline,

341
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,070
我们认为马斯特森
we think that Masterson

342
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,250
已经进入了弗吉尼亚州的西南角
has crossed into the southwest corner of Virginia.

343
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,340
在斯考特或华盛顿
Scott or Washington.

344
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,980
-然后呢  -然后
- And? - And...

345
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,210
格林助理局长
Assistant Director Green?

346
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,310
我们在依靠空中支援
We're relying on aerial support,

347
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,070
目击和当地执法部门
sightings and local law enforcement.

348
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,180
但我们比较确信
But we're fairly confident

349
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,770
我们可以在接下来24小时内找到他
we can have him pinned down in the next 24 hours.

350
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,220
总统要我们完全确定
The president wants us to be absolutely sure.

351
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,040
我们不能允许他再跑掉了  这事关饭碗
We can't have him getting away again. Careers are at stake.

352
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,470
这桌上的每个人
Everyone around this table

353
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,080
都清楚情况的严重性
is fully aware of the gravity of the situation.

354
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,150
很好  总统知道了会很高兴的
Good. The president will be happy to hear that.

355
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,010
好了  你想要什么样的吻
Okay. What kind of kiss do you want?

356
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,660
-爱斯基摩  -快进
- Eskimo. - In...

357
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,060
快出
and out.

358
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,920
我就回来
I'll be right back.

359
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,310
-你生气了  -是的
- You're angry. - I am.

360
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,310
我被提了问  我回答了
I was asked a question and I answered.

361
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,300
说得太轻了
That's the least of it.

362
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,040
好吧  我现在不想谈这个
Okay, well, I don't want to talk about it right now.

363
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,070
你是想输掉竞选吗  是吗
Are you trying to lose this election? Are you?

364
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,510
威尔  得了
Will, stop it.

365
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,650
你维护的这女人
This woman that you're defending...

366
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,230
她儿子砍了别人的头
Her son just cut someone's head off.

367
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,630
他还逍遥在外
And he's still out there somewhere.

368
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,660
-你知道这看上去什么样吗  -别说了
- Do you understand what this looks like? - Stop it.

369
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,130
你知道我们儿子为什么睡不着吗
Do you want to know why our son can't sleep?

370
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,770
他才八岁  却失眠了
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.

371
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,770
因为他做恶梦
Because he's having nightmares.

372
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,980
因为他觉得
Because he thinks

373
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,430
酒店里有头黑色大狗在到处跑
there's a big black dog running around the hotel.

374
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,740
-狗  -对
- Dog? - Yes.

375
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,810
他闭上眼睛  就能听到它咆哮
He closes his eyes, and he can hear it growling.

376
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,720
他害怕  威尔
He's scared, Will.

377
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,340
我说那些话是因为那女人也是受害者
I said what I said because that woman is a victim.

378
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,840
我们都是
We all are.

379
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,290
这必须停止了
And it has to stop.

380
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,380
我希望你赢
I want you to win.

381
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,370
去给自己倒一杯酒  我就回来
Get yourself a drink. I'll be right back.

382
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,850
那是他母亲  这是汉娜的回应
That's the mother. And this is Hannah's response.

383
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,950
她不是罪犯
She's not a criminal

384
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,500
不该因为她儿子的罪受惩罚
and should not be punished for the sins of her son.

385
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,560
我知道我们都反对
We all, I know, reject

386
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,680
这两位困惑受伤的青年的说法和行为
the rhetoric and actions of these damaged, troubled young men.

387
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,110
我是说  这是该反省的时候
What I mean is, this is a time for reflection,

388
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,710
而不是进攻
not aggression...

389
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,980
她没有表示宽恕  但表示了同情
So she's not condoning it, but it is sympathetic.

390
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,070
把约书亚和扎克瑞说成
Plays into the idea that Joshua and Zachary

391
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,050
一对儿寻找目标的困惑青年
were just a pair of troubled kids looking for a cause,

392
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,650
跟普通学校枪击手没什么区别
no different than some school shooter.

393
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,980
视频转发超过10万次了
The post has been shared over 100,000 times.

394
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,360
我想跟她谈谈
I want to talk with her.

395
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,220
-汉娜  -那个母亲
- Hannah? - The mother.

396
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,530
我们一直对你在哪露面十分小心
We've been very careful about where you appear.

397
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,450
-莉安  能让我们单独待会儿吗  -当然
- LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment? - Of course.

398
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,900
我们得加大恐惧感
We need to dial up the terror.

399
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,310
那个母亲能帮我们做到
And the mother can help us with that.

400
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,460
但那样我们还得找到马斯特森
But that also means we have to locate Masterson.

401
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,670
尽快
Soon.

402
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,620
汤姆在等我
Tom is waiting for me.

403
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,360
你去吧
Well, you go on.

404
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,680
弗兰西斯
Francis...

405
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,200
我不该在葬礼上哭
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.

406
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,940
-不  那效果很好  -对我不好
- No, it played beautifully. - Not for me.

407
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,190
跟我来
Come with me.

408
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,600
来吧  告诉他你要迟点到
Come on. Just tell him you'll be late.

409
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,460
-总统先生  -没事  警官
- Mr. President. - It's all right, Officer.

410
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,340
夫人
Ma'am.

411
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,190
能给我你的目镜吗
May I have your scope?

412
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,820
你枪上的目镜  我保证还回来
Scope on your gun. I promise I'll give it back.

413
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,250
谢谢  过来
Thank you. Come here.

414
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,470
如果你把目镜举在离脸稍远处
Now, if you just hold the scope a little a ways from your face...

415
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,590
往下看  直向下  草坪对面
and look down, straight down, across the lawn...

416
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,880
门那里
right to the gate.

417
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,990
看到他们了吗
You see them?

418
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,150
那些人想要发声  有些是支持的  有些反对
Those people want a voice. Some for, some against.

419
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,510
他们也在草坪那头往这边看
And they're looking back across the lawn,

420
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,980
看这栋房子  这些窗户
toward this house and these windows...

421
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,890
他们在想
and they're thinking,

422
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,210
"不知道总统
"I wonder what the president

423
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,520
和第一夫人今晚在做什么
and the First Lady are doing tonight.

424
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,070
他们能保护我们吗"
And will they be able to protect us?"

425
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,390
我该在场的
I should have been there.

426
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,330
哪里
Where?

427
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,380
你受枪伤时  我真该在场的
When you got shot. I wish I was there.

428
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,080
或许我还能
Maybe I could've...

429
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,710
保护你
protected you.

430
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,870
你瞧  那些人只想
You see, all those people want...

431
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,660
有人保护他们  不用面对可怕的真相
is someone to keep them from what they're afraid to know.

432
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,670
总统和第一夫人今晚要做什么呢  弗兰西斯
And what are the president and First Lady doing tonight, Francis?

433
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,500
托马斯不是还等着你呢吗
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.

434
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,290
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

435
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,230
我们明早见
I'll see you in the morning.

436
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,360
你有烟吗
Do you have a smoke?

437
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,480
谢谢
Thank you.

438
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:32,000

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,470
我饿了
I got hungry.

448
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,070
所以去了主厨房
So I went down to the main kitchen.

449
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,880
下面的人真不错
That's a lovely group of people you have down there.

450
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,720
如果你需要什么  可以叫人拿上来
If there's anything you need, it can be brought up.

451
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,970
我直到吃在嘴里才知道自己需要什么
I didn't know what I needed until I was eating it.

452
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,800
我听到了总统的声明
I heard the president's declaration.

453
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,480
很有力
Very compelling.

454
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,360
你究竟怎么想的
What did you really think?

455
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,740
简直像真的一样
It was almost like the real thing.

456
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,660
国安局的人很厉害  非常厉害
The NSA has good people. Very good.

457
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,570
-太厉害了  -不如你厉害
- Too good. - Not as good as you.

458
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,790
足以找到我的算法了
Good enough to find my algorithms.

459
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,980
那不代表他们知道我们用它做了什么
That doesn't mean they knew what we were using them for.

460
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,140
不不
No, no.

461
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,010
前一秒  他们还叫我回家  然后紧接着
One second, they send me home, and then the next,

462
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,770
他们说  "回来"
they tell me, "Come back!"

463
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,220
他们肯定要监视我了  这是个陷阱
They'll been watching me. This is a trap.

464
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,060
或是唯一的出路

465
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,210
该死
God damn it.

466
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,930
-你想要出路吗  -你不想吗
- You want out? - Don't you?

467
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,940
莉安
LeAnn...

468
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,790
我们做了违法的事
we have done some illegal things here.

469
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,570
还有其他竞选
There are other campaigns.

470
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,590
-如果你可以打入国安局  -那不可能
- If you can get into the NSA... - That's not possible.

471
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,550
进入他们的系统  你可以解决的
...into their system, you can fix this.

472
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,900
-你没听我说  -我听了
- You're not listening to me. - I am.

473
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,950
我了解安德伍德夫妇
I know the Underwoods.

474
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,970
我们如果想平安度过
The only way that we are gonna survive this...

475
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,900
就得让他们赢
is if they win.

476
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,170
你可以帮他们赢
You can help them win.

477
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,430
我知道你能
I know you can.

478
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,060
你走后我就加入了报社
I got on the paper right around the time you left.

479
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,400
你从时尚版块起步的吗
Did you start in Style?

480
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,720
都市
Metro desk.

481
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,130
然后我发了篇报道  一个街头时尚
But then I did this piece, a street fashion,

482
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,530
街头的孩子的报道
kids on the street thing.

483
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,440
没想到你会叫我来
I'm surprised you asked for me.

484
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,390
队伍里有些人员变化
Some people are being moved around and off the team.

485
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,130
马斯特森的报道  "战争  有什么好处"
The Masterson story. "War, what is it good for?"

486
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,860
你对调查性新闻感兴趣吗
Were you ever interested in investigative journalism?

487
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,020
要问我  不是这种的就不叫新闻
If you ask me, if it's not investigating, it's not journalism.

488
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,130
听这里的人说  你能让任何人对你开口
Word around here is you can get anybody to talk to you.

489
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,160
过了8点  又有酒的话

他们说她是个...

493
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
对不起  我有点紧张
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

494
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,490
你算是传奇人物
You're sort of a legend and...

495
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,390
报道总统的文章
articles on the president?

496
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,290
能跟你合作是莫大的荣幸

502
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,750
他们知道的  是吧

503
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,010
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood.

504
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,790
我想跟马斯特森女士说话
I was hoping to speak to Ms. Masterson.

505
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,730
就我们俩
Just the two of us.

506
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,150
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

507
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,870
这有点极端
It is a bit extreme.

508
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,930
把禁飞令扩大到这样的范围
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.

509
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,890
单是对签证的限制就前所未有
The restrictions on visas alone is unprecedented.

510
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,080
我们要如何解释
How do we justify?

511
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,630
白宫顾问已经讨论过了
The White House counsel's been all through that.

512
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,150
都白纸黑字写着了
It's there in black and white.

513
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,590
我们基本上是在
We're virtually closing down our borders

514
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,800
-没有证据的情况下关闭国境  -会有的
- without any hard evidence to back it up. - It's coming.

515
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,880
很多无辜的人正想进入这个国家
A lot of innocent people are trying to get into this country.

516
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,810
他们可能因此受伤害
They could be hurt by this.

517
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,350
如此大的政策变动  我想好好做
A change in policy this big, I want it done right.

518
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,920
我要你让世界知道
I want you to let the world know

519
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,170
如果他们还想继续进入这个国家
that if they want to continue coming to this country

520
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,810
上我们的医院  我们的学校  
for our hospitals, our colleges,

521
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,000
我们的高尔夫球场什么的
our golf courses and God knows what else...

522
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,500
他们光是
they're going to have to deliver

523
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,000
把我的脑袋贴在棍子上烧是不够的
more than my head on the end of a burning stick.

524
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,130
听着  凯茜
Now look, Cathy,

525
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,090
我知道你有辛苦经营的人脉
I know you have well-earned relationships out there.

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,210
都是老交情
Long-standing.

527
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,890
我没有保留  弗兰西斯  我都联络了
I'm not holding back, Francis. I have reached out.

528
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,510
那我需要你再加把劲  
Then I need you to reach further.

529
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,020
我要可行的情报
I want actionable intelligence.

530
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,430
我要知道哈里发国在哪  或者至少
I want to know where ICO is, or at the very least,

531
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,220
所有人都在找他们
that everyone's out there looking.

532
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,940
明白了吗
Are we clear?

533
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,240
明白了
We're clear.

534
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,300
谢谢  凯茜  我知道你不会让我失望
Thank you, Cathy. I know you won't let me down.

535
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
他死了
He's dead.

536
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,800
你是来告诉我这个的吗  
Is that why you're here?

537
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,000
我们还在找他
We're still looking for him--

538
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,440
因为如果他死了  我要见到他  摸到他
Because if he's dead, I want to see him. To touch him.

539
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,690
-我是想帮忙  -马斯特森太太
- I'm trying to help... - Ms. Masterson,

540
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,340
-但他没有联系我  -求你
- ...but he hasn't contacted me. - please.

541
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,270
我也希望他联系我
I wish he would.

542
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,730
我明白  冷静
I understand. Calm down.

543
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,930
他不像他们说的那样  是个禽兽
He's not a monster like they all say.

544
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,440
我不知何时失去了他  但他不是...
I lost him somewhere. But he's not...

545
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,370
但这世上还是有禽兽的  是吧
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?

546
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,380
我想要律师
I want my lawyer.

547
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,330
为什么
What for?

548
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,960
对不起  我不知道我为什么那么说
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

549
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
我已经不知道我都在说什么了
I don't know why I say anything anymore.

550
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,260
我想见你
I wanted to see you...

551
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,200
是想问你一个简单的问题
to ask you a simple question.

552
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,850
你不知道你家里发生的事吗
Didn't you know what was going on in your home?

553
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,360
-什么  -你知道的
- Excuse me? - You knew...

554
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,930
早在他去巴基斯坦之前
even before he went to Pakistan.

555
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,670
-是你养大了他  -不
- I mean, you raised him. - No.

556
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,510
不  他是有问题  他迷失了

557
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,810
但不  不是这样的
But no, nothing like this.

558
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,880
但你看到他做了什么吧
But you saw what he did, didn't you?

559
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,430
-不  -你想看吗
- No. - Would you like to see it?

560
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,910
如果你想  我们可以给你看
We can show it to you, if you like.

561
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,610
不  别
No. Please don't.

562
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,810
他对那家人  对那个人做的事
What he did to that family, to that man...

563
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,640
什么样的人能做出这种事
What sort of person would do such a thing?

564
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,840
他是我儿子
He's my son.

565
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,620
天呐
Oh, God.

566
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
我知道  很可怕  是吧
I know. It's awful, isn't it?

567
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,930
谢谢
Thank you.

568
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,160
你今天离开时
When you leave today,

569
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,360
会有记者  有摄像机在外面等着
there will be some reporters, some cameramen out there.

570
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,650
但你不需要说太多
But you don't need to say very much.

571
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,870
你只需要叫约书自首
You just need to ask Josh to turn himself in.

572
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,960
这世上还有很多辛辛苦苦的父亲和母亲
There are so many hardworking mothers and fathers out there.

573
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,810
这可能发生在他们任何人身上
This could've happened to any of them.

574
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,460
我们就要抓到你儿子了  马斯特森太太
We are close to capturing your son, Ms. Masterson,

575
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,620
我会尽全力让你见到他
and I will do my best to have you see him.

576
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,800
我想走了
I want to go.

577
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,250
没人不让你走
No one's keeping you.

578
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,980
但她安排了谁  
But who did she put in?

579
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,300
议长安排了谁进委员会
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?

580
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,930
大多是席位无忧的长期议员
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.

581
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,330
还剩两周  很难反对战争
We're two weeks out. It's hard to say no to war.

582
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,040
你和我有共同点
You and I have some things in common.

583
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,830
-我们都讨厌总统  -不  我终归是民主党人
- We both dislike the president. - No. I'm still a Democrat.

584
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,400
但是右倾
Who leans to the right.

585
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,760
艾力克斯  你的确是有些右倾的
Alex, you do actually lean a little to the right.

586
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,300
他是三军统帅
Look, he's the commander in chief.

587
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,400
他完全有权力决定去哪打仗
He's got all the authority he needs to fight them where they are.

588
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,230
此时此刻  国内就有个战场
Well, there's one here. Out there, right now, as we speak.

589
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,780
我是很支持美国执法机构的
Well, I'm a big fan of American law enforcement.

590
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,690
他们很快就能找到他
They'll find him soon enough.

591
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,590
我们不能让弗兰西斯·安德伍德让我们国家
We can't just let Francis Underwood turn us into a nation

592
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,840
变得时刻心惊胆战
that's always looking over their shoulder.

593
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,660
如果你能挤进那个委员会
If you can get yourself onto that committee,

594
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,680
我觉得主席会让你充分表达意见的
I got a feeling the Chair will give you all the time you need.

595
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,880
我的司机会送你回车上  但议员先生
My driver will take you back to your car. But, Congressman...

596
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,260
这是你的机会
this is your chance.

597
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,670
我觉得你也知道
And I think you know it.

598

见到你们真好  谢谢你们来

601
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,450
走开
Just go away!

602
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,240
你根本不知道自己家里发生的事
You have no idea what is happening in your own homes.

603
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,480
你知道他在哪吗  马斯特森太太
Have you any idea where he is, Mrs. Masterson?

604
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,610
约书  求你
Josh, please...

605
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,660
求你  求你自首吧
please, please turn yourself in.

606
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,060
这得停下了  不
This has all got to stop. No, no.

607
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,520
在财政部干了10年  他正等着呢
...this after ten years with Treasury, he was waiting for it.

608
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,410
是啊
Yeah...

609
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,190
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood!

610
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,450
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood!

611
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,100
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood!

612
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,680
政府是否认为爆炸跟
Does the administration believe that the explosion was connected

613
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,260
-约书亚·马斯特森有关  -我们尚不确定
- with Joshua Masterson somehow? - We're not sure yet.

614
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,060
有很多证据支持这一可能性
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.

615
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,330
店主的确是在外国出生
The owner of the establishment was foreign-born.

616
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,210
跟海外的哈里发国有关吗
Any connection to ICO overseas?

617
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,310
我认为助理局长
I think our Deputy Director

618
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,580
克拉克更有资格回答这个问题
Clark here is better equipped to answer that.

619
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,460
我们在调查  但现在  我们设立了热线
We're looking into it. In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.

620
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,390
如果有任何居民
If anyone in the community

621
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,600
-有什么...  -如果共和党候选人
- has any-- - And if the Republican candidate

622
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,810
和余下的共和党人不肯承认
and the rest of his party refuse to acknowledge

623
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,340
国内威胁的严重性
the seriousness of the threat made here at home...

624
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,070
那么我们会的
know that we will.

625
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,120
联调局正在收集言论和照片
The FBI is currently gathering a list of words and images.

626
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,220
如果它们出现在了你的孩子
If they appear on your children's

627
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,610
或你同事的设备上  请务必
or your coworkers' devices, please--

628
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,820
战争婊子
War whore!

629
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,680
-让开  -上车
- Move! - Car!

630
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,430
就是油漆而已  她没事
It was just paint. She's all right.

631
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,890
还有什么  说吧  道格  不会那么糟的
And what else? Spit it out, Doug. It won't taste so bad.

632
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,770
先生  我知道你在这事上跟我看法不同
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.

633
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,090
但格林局长和他的团队
But Director Green and his team

634
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,390
有了抓捕地点  准备行动了
have a location for the takedown and they're ready to act.

635
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,240
他们确定找对地方了吗
And they're positive it's the right location?

636
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,610
-非常确定  -什么时候
- Adamant. - When?

637
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,120
再过几小时
Hours.

638
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,090
我们可以在战况室协调
We can coordinate out of the Situation Room.

639
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,370
不  我要亲自见他
Oh, no. I'm gonna meet him in person.

640
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,110
先生  我强烈反对
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

641
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,520
知道了  但我要到场
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.

642
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:57,960
是  先生
Yes, sir.

643
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,580
人们随时会爆发恐惧  真是不可思议
It's amazing how ready people are to be afraid.

644
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,230
历史会证明他们是对的
History would prove them right.

645
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,380
幸好这个水能洗掉
You're lucky this is coming off with water.

646
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,220
可能会更糟呢
Could've been worse.

647
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,710
有点溅到你耳朵后面了
Some found its way behind your ear.

648
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,920
-我该害怕吗  -别耍聪明
- Should I be afraid? - Don't be smart.

649
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,530
我是该害怕  是吧
I should, shouldn't I?

650
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,400
我从你那儿偷了东西
I stole something from you.

651
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,120
什么
What?

652
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,660
是什么无所谓
What it is, doesn't matter.

653
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,520
我就是想要一样你的东西
I just wanted something that was yours.

654
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,980
放回去
Well, put it back.

655
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,160
瀑布
Waterfalls.

656
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,420
国安局用瀑布标记0day漏洞利用工具
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits as waterfalls.

657
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,880
它们能让我们进入什么
What can they get us into?

658
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,460
我们可以后门进入一些很火的社交网站
We can backdoor into some very popular social media.

659
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,190
我可以把任何你能想到的东西
I can insert anything your imagination can think of

660
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,530
放到那些网站上
into those sites.

661
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,830
安德伍德夫妇或其他人的
Underwoods or otherwise.

662
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,780
多个消息源称
...reports coming in from a variety of sources

663
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,000
当地警方和联调局
stating that local police enforcement and FBI agents

664
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,530
正在前方
are currently on the ground.

665
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,510
我们接到报告称
We're receiving reports that

666
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,500
弗吉尼亚州边境有大量警力
there's a great deal of police activity on the Virginia border.

667
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,070
我们目前不能确认
We cannot confirm at this time,

668
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,800
但我们认为  这跟对国内恐怖分子
but we believe this is connected to the manhunt

669
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,340
约书亚·马斯特森的搜寻有关
for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.

670
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,000
约书亚·马斯特森可能很快将被捕
The capture of Joshua Masterson may be close at hand.

671
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,100
联调局仍未就此发表评论
The FBI is still not commenting,

672
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,060
但请看航拍情况
but if you look at this aerial view,

673
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,620
可以看到全副武装的人
you can see heavily-armed men

674
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,800
正在林间穿行
making their way through this wooded area.

675
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,800
长官  他不在这儿
Sir, he's not here.

676
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,030
我们只审出了一些零散的国内联络人
All we have are some loose domestic connections.

677
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,920
对海外哈里发国的变态崇拜
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.

678
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,390
他不肯证实有大规模的国内网络存在
He refuses to confirm any wide-ranging homegrown network.

679
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:49,460
我们的审讯官认为此人已无价值
Our interrogators are confident the asset is no longer valuable.

680
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,800
冒险诱供已经不可行了
And risk to reward no longer tenable.

681
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,290
先生  我们已经到达了临界点
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.

682
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,060
你以为我没有已经抓到了他
Did you think I didn't already have him?

683
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,290
我会任他在外面流窜吗
That I would have left him out there somewhere?

684
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,330
我以为你了解我呢
And I thought you knew me.

685
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,850
约书
Josh.

686
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,560
约书亚
Joshua.

687
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,000
你想活吗
Do you want to live?

688
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,430
说出我们想知道的
Tell us what we want.

689
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,100
说出我们想知道的
Tell us what we want to hear.

690
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,110
你不是个殉道者  是吧
You're no martyr, are you?

691
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,710
看看你
Look at you.

692
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,560
不  你不是个殉道者
No, you're not a martyr.

693
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,950
没人会记住你所做的事
No one will remember what you've done,

694
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:31,190
不管是在这人间  还是在你的天堂
either here on Earth or in your heaven.

695
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,800
你为什么选择米勒一家
So why did you pick the Millers?

696
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,650
为什么
Why?

697
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,310
你看到了什么
What did you see?

698
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,460
是因为那女孩吗
Was it the girl?

699
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,630
你是先看上了她吗
Did you see her first?

700
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,790
你看上了什么
What did you see?

701
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,280
还是她先看到了你
Or did she see you first?

702
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:14,770
没错  就是这样吧  她看到了你
Yeah, that's it, isn't it? She saw you.

703
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,450
她一眼就看穿了你  是吧
She looked right through you, didn't she?

704
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,500
我不需要再看到他了
I don't need to see this person anymore.

705
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,330
-处理掉他  -先生
- Get rid of the asset. - Sir.

706
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,950
他是个禽兽  但他终归是美国公民
He's an animal, but he's still an American citizen.

707
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,780
我们在交战  他是敌方战斗人员
We are at war. And he is an enemy combatant.

708
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,080
他砍下那可怜人的脑袋时  就失去了一切
And he lost whatever rights he might have had as an American

709
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,030
美国人的权利
when he cut that poor man's head off.

710
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,230
所以少跟我说你的骄傲或立场
So don't give me your pride or your position.

711
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,100
因为如果你当初能照做
Because none of this would have happened

712
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,070
这一切都不会发生了
if you'd done what you were told in the first place.

713
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,760
我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

714
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,900
你当然会  而且会自愿自觉地做
Yes, you will, and you will do so willingly.

715
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,230
我要你拍到杀他时好的
And I want you to get some good, usable footage...

716
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,900
可用的录像
of his killing.

717
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,180
然后销毁其他一切
And then destroy everything else.

718
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:31,040
我们要发布约书亚·马斯特森被杀的视频
We will be releasing footage of Joshua Masterson's killing.

719
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,170
政府和情报机构
The administration and the intelligence community

720
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:37,200
本希望活捉他
were hoping to take him alive.

721
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,150
但我想赞扬
But I would like to commend

722
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:41,010
反恐处助理局长  纳森·格林
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.

723
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,170
当然还有
And of course all of the work

724
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,600
国务卿杜兰特做的一切相关幕后工作
that Secretary Durant has done behind the scenes on all of this.

725
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,180
调查目前为止收集到的信息
The information the investigation has gathered so far

726
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,370
表明约书亚·马斯特森和扎克瑞·霍桑
points to Joshua Masterson and Zachary Hawthorne

727
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,930
跟海外的哈里发国
having strong connections to ICO abroad

728
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,670
和国内在发展的哈里发国网络有密切关系
and ICO's growing network domestically.

729
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:01,630
所以我想直接对哈里发国说以下这些话
And so I would like to say this to ICO directly.

730
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:05,760
你们再别想左右哪怕一个年轻人的头脑
You will not infect the mind of one more of our young people,

731
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,760
因为我不会罢休  直到我找到你
because I will not stop until I find you.

732
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,820
这话也说给悲痛中的米勒一家
And I say that for the grieving Miller family,

733
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,440
希望他们今晚能睡得着
whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.

734
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,460
我还敦促国会
I also urge Congress

735
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,860
加快进程
to accelerate the process

736
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,350
就我的宣战请求做出表决
and vote on my request for a declaration of war.

737
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,730
-总统先生  -我不会回答问题
- Mr. President? - I will not be answering questions.

738
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,290
接下来赛斯会接手
Seth will take it from here.

739
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,880
不好分辨  但那应该是致命一击
It's hard to see, but I think that was the killshot.

740
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,530
请记住  这些报道尚未经证实
Now, please remember, these reports are unconfirmed

741
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,150
我们还在等待白宫的声明
and we're waiting on a statement from the White House.

742
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,160
我们可以报道  有大量...
What we can report is a great deal...

743
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,630

{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}"宣战权"在美国法律和政府实践中是一个比较混乱的灰色区域
美国宪法规定国会拥有正式宣战权  但又规定美国总统是三军统帅
作为行政机构的首脑  历史上  美国总统经常援引后一条规定
以自己作为三军统帅有绝对的军事指挥权为由绕过国会  发动军事行动
事实上  二战之后  美国总统发动大规模军事行动时  从未寻求国会授权
为了夺回宣战权  国会1973年通过了《战争权力法案》
但该法案同时规定  总统可以先发动军事行动  后在90天内寻求国会授权
73年的法案通过后  除了大小布什发动两次海湾战争时获得了国会授权
其余绝大多数情况下  美国总统都无视这个法律的存在
所以现实中  "国会授权"反而成了总统想回避军事行动时的一个借口
而真正下决心采取行动时  反而可以不用理会国会
