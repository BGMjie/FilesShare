她的律师不让我们靠近她
Her lawyers won't let us get anywhere near her.

24
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
因为他们在商量她的证词
Because they're negotiating her testimony.

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,540
我们到底是怎么到这一步的
How the hell did we get here?

26

Well, she's not testifying because of an affair.

31
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,260
她作证是因为她不想进监狱
She's testifying 'cause she doesn't want to go to jail.

32
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,380
任何人出庭作证都只因为这个

我会在我党这边发力  但  罗梅洛
I'll keep working my side of the aisle, but... uh, Romero.

36
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,690
他是个混蛋
He's a prick.

37
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,850
一个依然想当党鞭的混蛋

乌麦克给了你什么
What has Womack brought you?

41
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,910
宣战委员会是他解决的吗
Did he kill the Declaration of War Committee?

42
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,230
11月时他帮你拿下密苏里了吗
Did he deliver Missouri for you in November?

43
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,380
够了
That's enough.

44
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,930
满足他吧
Let's give it to him.

45
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,630
有时你得做出艰难抉择

我会跟泰瑞谈的
I'll talk to Terry.

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,200
罗梅洛得给他找个地方落脚
Romero's gonna have to find a place for him to land, and...

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,520
落在哪我是在意的
where that is matters to me.

49
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,040
就这样吧
That'll be all for now.

50
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,020
好  先生
Yes, sir.

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,390
我会让道尔去查
I'm gonna put Doyle on this.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,100
我们已经审查过罗梅洛了
We already vetted Romero.

53
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,100
不  我是说查厄舍
No, I mean on Usher.

54
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,960
尸体保存得非常完好
The body is remarkably well-preserved,

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,700
除了手脚  因为都冻伤了
except for the extremities, which frostbite took care of.

56
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,220
但牙齿是完好的
But dental is intact.

57
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,510
我们在南极的同行正在全力配合
Our counterparts in Antarctica are cooperating fully,

58
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,470
12小时内尸体会到我们手上
and the body will be in our possession within the next 12 hours.

59
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,080
报关后我会派人把它运回来
I'll have it in transit after customs.

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,260
我们希望尸体在运输中失踪
We'd like the body to get lost in transit.

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,200
女士
Ma'am?

62
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,390
它必须失踪

63
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,950

好  谢谢  助理局长格林
Okay. Thank you, Assistant Director Green.

65
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,520
我们再联系
Uh, keep in touch.

66
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,880
-我还以为你已经睡了  -还不能睡
- I thought you'd gone to bed. - Can't yet.

67
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,310
-那是谁  -我们不认识
- Who's that? - No one we know.

68
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,960
汤姆  我说了  我们不认识
Tom, I said it's no one we know.

69
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,050
你听说过他们在意大利阿尔卑斯山发现的
You ever hear about the 5,000-year-old man they found

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,860
冰冻五千年的干尸吗
frozen in the Italian Alps?

71
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,770
没有
No.

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,290
他的头骨后面被砸出了坑
His skull was caved in... from the back.

73
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,940
他大概根本没料到
He probably never saw it coming.

74
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,740
被痛打一顿  留下等死
Beaten and left for dead.

75
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,970
留下等死是一个古老的概念
Left for dead is an ancient concept.

76
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,550
当人被冻死的时候
You know, when you freeze to death...

77
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,290
最后会感觉非常热
the last thing you feel is extreme heat.

78
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,470
疼
That hurts.

79
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,900
抱歉
Sorry.

80
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,670
我刚看到了弗兰西斯
I saw Francis out there.

81
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,490
他好像很焦躁
He seems on edge.

82
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,970
能怪他吗
Can you blame him?

83
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,680
好点了吗
Better?

84
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
最重的罪是入店行窃
Shoplifting is the worst of it.

85
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,700
近来几次在街上买毒品  而被法庭强制戒毒
A couple of recent street buys that led to court-mandated rehab.

86
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,320
她就在那里生活  工作  买毒品
That's where she lives, where she works, where she scores...

87
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,750
但依我看就是个二十多的女人  努力想活到三十
But all I see here is a woman in her 20s, trying to get to 30.

88
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,620
-她是个威胁  -我不懂
- She's a concern. - I don't get it.

89
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,700
嘉文·奥尔西去委内瑞拉之前  她和他有联系
She was in touch with Gavin Orsay before he left for Venezuela.

90
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,370
-道格  -纳森
- Doug... - Nathan!

91
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,190
你的语气有点急  我们可能得讨论下
There's a bite to your tone that we might need to discuss.

92
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,120
她是个隐患  是个瘾君子
She's a loose end and an addict.

93
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,510
这两样合在一起很糟
That's a bad combination.

94
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,060
重新装修了
It's a clean slate.

95
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,390
唐纳德·布莱斯的品味对我来说太暗了
Donald Blythe's taste was a bit too dark for me,

96
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,090
所以我全拆掉了
so I stripped it all back.

97
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,790
我选了一副画  还在路上
I have chosen one painting so far that's on its way, though.

98
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,020
撒德·彼得森的尸体处理好了
Thad Peterson's body is taken care of.

99
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,370
他叫无名氏
His name is John Doe.

100
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,360
他化成灰我都认识
I'd recognize him anywhere.

101
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,020
这本来会伤害到我国的
This would've been very embarrassing to some interests

102
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,500
一些重要利益
that are important to this country.

103
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,360
我也不希望他的家人看到他这样
And I wouldn't want the family to see him this way.

104
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,700
约旦大使馆有什么消息
What's the news from the Jordanian Embassy?

105
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,750
艾丹·麦卡伦仍不愿
Aidan Macallan still won't

106
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,900
透露他跟佩特洛夫说了什么  没说什么
reveal what he did or didn't tell Petrov.

107
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,670
总统希望他立刻从避难地
Well, the president wants him brought back from his asylum

108
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,190
回到美国
to the United States immediately.

109
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,100
我们应该耐心点儿
I think we should give it a little more time.

110
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,740
我在想让你插手明不明智
You know, I wonder if it was such a good idea to bring you in on this.

111
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,790
-你承诺了  -我知道  艾哈迈迪...
- You promised-- - I know. Ahmadi...

112
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,290
我们派了特种部队去当地追踪
We've got Special Forces on the ground, tracking.

113
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,730
俄罗斯在叙利亚的存在
Russia's presence in Syria

114
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,250
让此事比我曾经想得要复杂
is making this more difficult than I once thought.

115
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,330
我得知道麦卡伦跟佩特罗夫说了什么
I need to know what Macallan told Petrov.

116
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,430
男人制造烂摊子的天赋
It never ceases to astonish me

117
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,580
总能让我吃惊
how talented men are at making a mess.

118
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,680
打击同党对你来说可没好处
Uh, it's not gonna serve you to go after your own party.

119
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,260
你从不放弃
You never stop.

120
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,180
杰姬·夏普不会作证的
Jackie Sharp will never testify.

121
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,860
那她就得进监狱
Well, then she'll go to jail.

122
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,320
艾力克斯  你证明不了他们之间有交换条件
You can't prove it, Alex. You can't prove the quid pro quo.

123
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,130
她好像觉得我可以
She seems to think I can.

124
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,370
如果你换种方式
If you play it a little differently,

125
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,570
还有机会实现目标
you have a chance to get what you want.

126
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,880
我们可以给你党鞭的位子
We're offering you whip.

127
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,310
-我不想要了  -什么
- I don't want it anymore. - What?

128
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,680
天啊
Jesus Christ.

129
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,440
那就财政委员会
Ways and Means, then.

130
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,530
在下次党代会上做主讲
The keynote at the next convention.

131
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,900
我只想让弗兰西斯·安德伍德进监狱
What I want is for Francis Underwood to go to jail.

132
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,570
天呐  这对你有什么好处
My God. How is that gonna help you?

133
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,360
真的  这对你有什么好处
Really? How's it gonna help you?

134
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,510
还有别的办法做到
There's another way to go at it.

135
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,110
你想扬名
Wanna make a name for yourself?

136
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,760
你想让总统生不如死
You wanna make the president's life a living hell?

137
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,670
那就慢慢来
Draw it out.

138
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,580
让委员会继续  但要温水煮青蛙
Keep the committee going but at a slow burn.

139
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,350
你不是为他工作吗
Aren't you working for him?

140
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,260
政府成员  一次找一个人
Members of the administration, you bring 'em in one at a time.

141
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,570
你可以纠缠几年  一边稳住自己的地位
You could ride this for a couple of years and secure your place.

142
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,730
而你压制住总统
While you keep the president in check.

143
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,310
别传唤杰姬·夏普  否则计划会胎死腹中
Don't end it before it's begun by calling Jackie Sharp.

144
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,720
你知道我看好你
You know I see good things for you.

145
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,150
让我为你规划接下来的八年
Let me plan out your next eight years.

146
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,320
与你合作的候选人
The candidates you worked with...

147
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,770
他们中有多少人反复等待
how many of them have waited and waited

148
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,400
误了时机
and lost their moment?

149
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,410
嗯  没错
Yeah, that's right.

150
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,590
我分析当下时局  现在属于我
I'm reading the moment, and this is mine.

151
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,640
让我在第三街下车
Let me out on Third Street.

152
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,360
我送你到雷伯恩大楼
I'll drop you at Rayburn.

153
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,420
不  我总是走最后46米
No, I always walk the final 50 yards.

154
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,710
可能有机会做政治交际
Never know when you might get a chance to press some flesh.

155
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,050
是啊
Yeah.

156
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,760
你好  我是艾力克斯·罗梅洛
Hi, I'm Alex Romero.

157
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,060
我代表亚利桑那州第七区
I represent the Seventh District of Arizona.

158
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,430
我想知道你昨晚失眠的原因
I want to know what keeps you up at night,

159
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,450
我今天好解决这一问题
so I can work all day to address it.

160
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,330
未来属于我们所有人
The future belongs to all of us.

161
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,420
但愿我能得到你的支持
I hope I can count on your support.

162
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,950
你觉得怎么样  马克
What do you think, Mark?

163
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,810
你可是专家
I mean, you're the expert.

164
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
就这儿
Right here.

165
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,410
罗梅洛拒绝了  一般的条件他也不感兴趣
Romero said no, and the usual offers don't interest him.

166
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,730
他感兴趣  你只是恨自己感兴趣
Oh, he's interested. He just hates himself for it.

167
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,470
关于委员会的共和党人  我有了进展
I am making headway with the Republicans on the committee.

168
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,620
他们都有不可告人的过去  大多有目击证人
They all have pasts, most of them have witnesses.

169
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,110
无论如何  杰姬·夏普不会作证
One way or another, Jackie Sharp won't be testifying.

170
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,580
那你为什么这么难搞定
So why are you having so much trouble

171
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,370
这位年轻议员
with this one young congressman?

172
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,760
他很固执
He's tenacious.

173
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,260
他让我想起了你
He reminds me of you.

174
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,360
我根本看不出来  我们再联系
Well, I don't see that at all. We'll talk later.

175
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,480
我可以联系丹顿
I could reach out to Danton--

176
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,700
我们曝光他  他就会曝光我们
We expose him, he'll expose us.

177
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,400
那你有什么建议
Well, then what do you suggest?

178
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,350
继续做总统该做的事
That I go on being presidential.

179
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,480
我只有这一个办法
That's the only way that I can deal with this.

180
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,170
我的就职头百天啊
It's my first 100 days, for God's sake.

181
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,170
弗兰西斯
Francis...

182
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,310
我们会捉住艾哈迈迪的
we're going to get our hands on Ahmadi.

183
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,440
世界上再多的艾哈迈迪
There aren't enough Ahmadis in the world.

184
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,130
也抵不掉我们做的那些事
Not for all we've done.

185
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,520
那怎么办
Then what?

186
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,610
比如毁了罗梅洛  这件事总能办到吧
Destroy Romero, for one. Can we at least take care of that?

187
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,790
然后毁谁  整个民主党吗
And then who? The rest of the Democratic Party?

188
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,290
我知道我在做什么  克莱尔  我当过总统
I know what I'm doing, Claire. I've been president before.

189
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,470
我也当过
So have I.

190
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,150
给我接泰瑞·乌麦克
Get me Terry Womack.

191
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,210
你作为副总统的职责是给我建议
Your job as vice president is to advise.

192
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,570
做决定是我的职责
My job is to make the decisions.

193
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,050
泰瑞  没错  我就是问问情况
Terry, yes, I'm just checking in.

194
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,880
我希望你知道我们都支持你
Well, I want you to know that we support you.

195
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,940
那混蛋还想当党鞭  做梦去吧
That bastard asked for whip, but that's never gonna happen.

196
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,500
只要我在台上就别想  我把话给你撂这儿
Not while I'm in this office. I wanted to assure you.

197
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,970
我一向在能出力的地方帮忙
I've always tried to help where I can.

198
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,190
你在卫生和人类服务部帮不上忙吗
And you couldn't help at Health and Human Services?

199
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,890
我们这里做了很多了不起的事
The agency does some amazing work.

200
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,260
你接受采访时曾说那是你梦寐以求的工作
Well, you were quoted as, uh, calling your position a dream job.

201
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,040
人是可以有多个梦想的
It's possible to have more than one dream.

202
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,610
我可以让助手带你逛逛
I can have my assistant give you a tour.

203
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,970
给你看看海地发来的视频
Uh, show you some of the video from Haiti

204
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,780
拍的是过去几个月  我们在那边的
and some of the work that we've been doing there

205
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,750
工作和成绩
over the last several months.

206
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,440

I will be sure to include

207

你们组织写进我的报道

-我相信你们的事业  -谢谢
- I believe in the work you're doing here. - Thank you.

209
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,430
和安德伍德政府合作  感觉怎么样
What was it like, uh, working with the Underwood administration?

210
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,170
他们还行  且这么说吧
They were fine. Let's leave it at that.

211
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,400
我采访过许多非常棒的组织
You know, I've met with, uh, many wonderful organizations so far.

214
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,500
这个组织也很棒
Another terrific group.

215
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,530
还有安东尼·莫雷蒂纪念基金
The Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.

216
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,320
他们我倒没什么了解
I don't know anything about them.

217
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,540
他们是器官移植宣传组织
Organ transplantation awareness.

218
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,500
是吗
Oh, is that right?

219
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,690
非常抱歉
I'm so sorry.

220
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,700
太失礼了  但我又太饿了
It's rude, but I was famished.

221

谢谢你肯来见我  我给你拿菜单

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,090
那就好  一定要有个吃午饭的地方
Good. You should always have one on the books.

224
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,560
-戴维斯女士  -你担心艾丹
- Miss Davis? - You're worried about Aidan.

225
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,670
你称呼他有什么昵称吗
Do you call him anything for short?

226
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,380
为什么问我这个
Why would you ask me that?

227
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,420
我不知道总统或者副总统
I don't know if the president, or vice president,

228
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,640
告没告诉你  但麦卡挺好的
has informed you, but Mac is fine.

229
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,430
问题在于他知道什么
It's what he knows is the problem,

230
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,360
他都跟谁说过
and who he may have told it to.

231
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,660
他只想活下去
He wants to stay alive.

232
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,950
没错
Yes.

233
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,940
但这种人才得小心
But those are the ones you have to watch out for.

234
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,610
我上次和艾丹说完话他就上了出租车
Last I spoke to Aidan was minutes before he got in a cab.

235
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,260
我不知道他有什么  也不知道他做了什么
I don't know what he has or what he's done.

236
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,040
我只是奉命行事
I only do what I'm told.

237
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,720
我就在胡佛大楼上班
I'm in the Hoover Building.

238
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,840
那真是全城最丑的一栋楼
It's the ugliest building in... in the city.

239
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,050
我每次进去都闭着眼
I close my eyes as I walk in.

240
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,500
有空来坐坐  尤其是你想找人谈谈的时候
Stop by any time. Especially if you're in the mood to talk.

241
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,210
像你这样口风紧的人  我们用得上
We could use someone who says as little as you do.

242
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,790
丽萨
Lisa!

243
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,960
-我一直在找她  -我不知道她在哪
- I've been looking for her. - I have no idea where she is.

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,950
-我帮你拿吧  -不用了
- Let me help you with that. - No. No, I'm okay.

-我很乐意帮你拿  -你吓到我了
- I'm happy to carry it for you. - You're scaring me.

246

我只是担心她而已
I'm just worried about her. That's all.

247
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,580
我戒了
I'm clean.

248
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,220
很好
Good.

249
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,380
至少我努力在戒  求你别缠着我了
At least I'm trying to get clean. Please leave me alone.

250
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,570
就是
Just...

251
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,360
如果你有瑞秋的消息  请你
If you hear from Rachel, just, uh...

252
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,510
告诉她我全都打点好了
tell her I've taken care of everything.

253
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,680
她可以回来了  不会有事的
She can come home and everything will be fine.

254
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,110
我想她  你知道吗
I miss her, you know?

255
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,600
抱歉
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,820
你不接吗
You going to answer that?

257
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,590
我说得对吗
So, was I right?

258
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,380
你的电话响了
Your phone is ringing.

259
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,550
你按边上的按钮就可以直接挂断
You know, you can just hang it up by pressing the button on the side.

260
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,330
-你不用拒接  -我习惯了
- You don't have to decline-- - I'm a creature of habit.

261
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,540
是的  你是对的
So, yeah, you were right.

262
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,390
这部电话只用过一次  拨打了一个号码
This phone has only been used once to call one number, once.

263
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,470
我用了生产序列号
I mean, I used the manufacturer's serial number

264
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,910
追踪到了它的经销商所在地
and tracked down where it's distributed to.

265
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,820
是在  杜邦环岛的一家商店
It was a, um... A shop in Dupont Circle.

266
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,280
打给了谁
And who did it call?

267
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,060
查无此人
Comes up unknown.

268
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,850
不过前几位数字
But the prefix...

269
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,580
听着  你得找警察或联调局谈
And, look, you're gonna have to talk to the police or the FBI.

270
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,530
-我不能一直  -别担心  我担着
- I just can't keep-- - Don't worry. It's on me.

271
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,780
那个号码的前几位  我看着像政府号码
The prefix on the call, it looks like a government number to me.

272
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,060
喂
Hello.

273
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,530
他跟踪你了  什么时候
He followed you? When?

274
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,700
-我得去  -好的
- I've got to... - Yeah.

275
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,970
好的  如果你觉得现在待的地方安全  
Okay. Okay, if you feel safe where you are,

276
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,360
那就待着  我来找你
stay there. I'm coming to you.

277
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,350
有什么不能在电话上告诉我的
So what couldn't you tell me over the phone?

278
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,500
杰姬·夏普
Jackie Sharp.

279
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,300
她怎么了
What about her?

280
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,400
你真不知道吗
You really don't know?

281
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,010
我还以为这事是白宫传出来的
I thought this was coming out of the White House.

282
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,120
马上要爆出来了
The story's about to break

283
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,210
说她拿立法换取竞选资金
that she traded legislation for campaign funds.

284
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,880
消息来源呢
The source?

285
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,810
所以是未经确认的
So, unconfirmed.

286
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,370
一小时内就会上《德拉吉报道》了
It's going to be on Drudge within the hour.

287
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,180
你真没什么要说的吗
You really don't have anything to say?

288
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,090
如果是真的  很遗憾看到民主党
If it's true, it's just sad to see the unexpected fall

289
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,810
一颗曾经的新星这样出人意料地陨落
of a once rising star in the Democratic Party.

290
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,950
得了吧
Stop it.

291
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,160
夏普本能让委员会拿下一分
Sharp would've been a get for the committee.

292
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,310
如果你仍愿意作证  我们就仍愿意谈
If you're still willing to appear, we're still willing to talk.

293
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,350
回见
See ya.

294
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,150
我们这个政府不是这么办事的
This is not how we do things in this administration.

295
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,910
你希望她不作证
You wanted her not to testify.

296
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,210
现在罗梅洛不可能逼她就范了
And there's no way Romero can force her to now.

297
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,220
你让我的新闻发言人
You've put my press secretary

298
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,670
和他的人处于了非常尴尬的境地
and his staff in a very difficult situation.

299
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,950
有人泄密  并不是你
It was a leak, and it didn't come from you.

300
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,410
我真心觉得这样才能占得先机
I really felt this was the way to get ahead of it.

301
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,560
这叫占得先机
This is getting ahead of it?

302
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,510
我向你们保证  她的律师
I guarantee you her lawyers

303
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,550
现在一定让她保持沉默  缄口不谈
tell her to plead the Fifth now, across the board.

304
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,380
最重要的是  对涉及你们的事闭嘴
Most importantly, where it concerns you.

305
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,960
但这都是在我跟佩特罗夫谈判时发生的
But all of this happened while I was negotiating with Petrov.

306
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,870
对大众而言  你当时是第一夫人
Oh, to the public, you were the First Lady,

307
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,740
正不眠不休地守在丈夫的床边
sitting vigil by your husband's bed.

308
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,570
所以这都是在唐纳德·布莱斯的监管下发生的
So, actually, all of this happened under Donald Blythe's watch.

309
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,110
如果你们觉得我越界了  很抱歉
I'm sorry if you think I overstepped.

310
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,850
我是想保护你们
I was trying to protect you.

311
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,710
他做了正确的事
He did the right thing.

312
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,940
我不介意他做了什么
Oh, I don't mind what he did.

313
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,800
我介意的是他做事的方式
I mind the way he did it.

314
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,590
-莉安  -副总统女士
- LeAnn... - Madam Vice President.

315
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,500
抱歉  我的行程太满了
I'm sorry my schedule is so full.

316
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,690
没关系  我非常理解
No, I completely understand,

317
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,270
毕竟你要处理那么多事
with everything that you're dealing with.

318
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,170
抱歉我这么固执
I'm sorry for being so insistent,

319
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,930
但我觉得应该让你知道
but I thought you should

320
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,880
简·戴维斯昨天来找我了
know that Jane Davis came after me yesterday.

321
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,090
找你
Came after you?

322
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,600
她想让我去为她工作  不知你是否知情
She wanted me to work for her. I didn't know if you knew.

323
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,200
为她做哪方面的工作
In what capacity?

324
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,240
这点我还不确定  不过
That, I'm not clear on, but it...

325
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
她想要关于艾丹·麦卡伦的信息
She wanted information about Aidan Macallan.

326
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,990
希望你知道我绝不会透漏一个字
I hope you know I would never say a word.

327
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,260
谢谢你让我知道这些
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

328
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,730
女士  我希望能讨论一下我的前途
Ma'am, I was hoping we could discuss my future.

329
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,360
莉安  我很乐意讨论你的前途  但现在不行
Oh, LeAnn, I would love to discuss your future, but not yet.

330
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,030
如果你愿意  女士  艾丹的事我能帮忙
If you would like, ma'am, I can help with Aidan.

331
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,820
你尽管吩咐
Anything that's required.

332
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,400
很高兴知道你有这个心
That's good to know.

333
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,130
你觉得莉安·哈维不会告诉我吗
Did you think LeAnn Harvey wouldn't tell me?

334
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,210
我从不假设人们会做什么或不会做什么
I never assume what people will do or won't do.

335
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,340
-我以为我们在默契合作  -没错啊
- I thought we were working well together. - We are.

336
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,990
绕过我套取信息
Well, going around me to get information

337
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,490
只会在你我之间造成嫌隙
will only create discord between us.

338
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,870
我并不想这样  克莱尔
I wouldn't want that, Claire.

339
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,890
-戴维斯女士  -总统先生
- Miss Davis. - Mr. President.

340
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,080
抱歉我来晚了
I'm sorry I'm late.

341
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,090
副总统告诉我你的联系人
The vice president has told me that your contacts

342
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,760
再次跟丢了艾哈迈迪
have once again lost track of Ahmadi.

343
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,320
是  我解释过
Yes, as I explained,

344
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,550
叙利亚局势每天都在天翻地覆
Syria is like a different country one day to the next.

345
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,800
这你得归咎于维克多·佩特罗夫
Yes, well, you can thank Viktor Petrov for that.

346
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,180
我是怪他
Oh, I do.

347
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,910
夫人
Ma'am?

348
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,300
我得失陪了  简
Oh, you'll have to excuse me, Jane.

349
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,460
我现在都快忙疯了
The schedule is crazy these days.

350
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,620
当然
Oh, of course.

351
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,120
有没有搞错  国务院加国防部
Really? The State Department, the Pentagon,

352
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
连个艾哈迈迪都捉不住
we can't get close to Ahmadi?

353
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,450
我只想要和平
I just want peace.

354
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,540
是啊  和平的利润最丰厚
Yes, there's nothing that makes profits like peace.

355
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,580
而有利润的地方最和平
And nothing makes peace like profits.

356
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,970
总统先生  我能有话直说[迟钝]吗
Mr. President, may I be blunt?

357
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,130
我可不觉得你是迟钝的人  戴维斯女士
Well, I would never accuse you of dullness, Miss Davis.

358
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,250
霍姆斯城将会遭受一场毒气袭击
There's going to be a gas attack happening in the city of Homs.

359
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,970
而如果说  您划下红线
If you were to, let us say, draw a line in the sand...

360
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,170
然后又发生了这样惨烈的袭击
and if this tragic attack were to happen...

361
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,950
那美国政府将不得不
the US government would have

362
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,980
加派三万多名士兵进驻
to send in an additional 30,000 or so soldiers.

363
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,550
以保护石油管线
To protect the oil lines,

364
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,730
阻止佩特罗夫拿下大马士革
to keep Petrov from getting into Damascus.

365
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,750
当然了  还要保护人民
And, of course, to protect the people.

366
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,630
这么大规模的军队几乎就是全面占领了
That's venturing close to occupation with those kind of numbers.

367
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,830
我只是在说  也许宣战委员会
All I'm saying is maybe the Declaration of War Committee

368
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,860
终于可以辩论他们该辩论的了
could finally debate what they were mandated to.

369
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,700
开战
A war.

370
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,150
你认识马克·厄舍吗
Do you know Mark Usher?

371
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,790
认识  我们合作过
Yes, we worked together.

372
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,570
当时他在协助一位众议员
He was handling a congressman.

373
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,300
马克
Mark.

374
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,680
有人给你拿过什么吗
Has anyone offered you anything?

375
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,200
没有  不用  谢谢了
Oh, no, I'm good. Thanks.

376
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,110
你和简·戴维斯合作过吗
Have you ever worked with Jane Davis?

377
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,160
戴维斯是她继父的姓
Davis is the stepfather's name.

378
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,590
一个只干了一任的参议员
A one-term senator.

379
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,470
总之
Uh, anyway, yeah,

380
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,380
她曾对我的一位客户有点兴趣
she was interested in a client I had, at some point.

381
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,210
国会议员候选人
A candidate for Congress.

382
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,100
可怜人  厄舍一意识到他不够强硬
Poor guy. The minute Usher realized he wasn't formidable enough,

383
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,280
就甩手走人  让他自生自灭了
he just dumped him. Let him go.

384
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,610
但马克就这样
But that's Mark.

385
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,350
他擅长发现人才
He has an eye for talent.

386
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,940
喜欢密切关注你  而他自己却站得远远的
Likes to keep you close while he keeps himself remote.

387
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,780
但是他不同意她在一些问题上的立场
But he disagreed with some of her positions,

388
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,870
于是资金就断掉了
the money went away.

389
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,630
听我说  千万别让简骗了你
Listen, don't let Jane fool you.

390
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,480
她看上去可能有点  没有章法
She can seem a bit... haphazard...

391
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,250
但只要他利用完了你
But once he's done with you...

392
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,020
就会像关上开关那么干脆决绝
it's as if a switch gets turned off.

393
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,020
但她冷酷无情
But she is merciless.

394
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,370
要多专一就有多专一
Single-minded as a single mind can be.

395
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,170
怎么了  我今天忘了吃饭了
What? Forgot to eat today.

396
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,730
你给我查出什么了
What have you got for me?

397
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,140
-不知道  -少跟我"不知道"
- I don't know. - Don't do "I don't know."

398
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,530
我去见了梅瑞迪斯·李
Saw Meredith Lee.

399
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,320
我提到了莫雷蒂基金  器官移植
I mentioned the Moretti Fund, organ transplants, uh...

400
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,300
她看起来有点紧张  可是  我说不好
She got a little tense, but... I don't know.

401
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,500
你怎么没告诉我你被开除了
Why didn't you tell me you were fired?

402
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,280
-原来是你  -就是我和你女友说了话
- Oh, that was you? - Who talked to your girlfriend? Yeah.

403
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:43,970
多久了
How long?

404
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,420
有什么区别  我穷途末路了
What's the difference? I'm tapped.

405
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,690
我们在干什么呢
What are we doing here?

406
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,590
我不喜欢有人在我车上吃东西
I don't like eating in my car.

407
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,640
我觉得劳拉·莫雷蒂的丈夫
I think Laura Moretti's husband

408
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,030
在捐赠名单上被插队了
was jumped on the donor list.

409
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,220
-这你是从哪听说的  -直觉
- Where the hell did you get that? - My gut.

410
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,460
不信我分析给你听
I can lay it out for you.

411
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,640
敢这么说话  你最好说到做到
Yeah, you say something like that, you better.

412
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,560
沙林毒气  主要袭击霍姆斯近郊的平民区
Sarin gas. Mostly against civilians in suburban areas of Homs.

413
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,390
-我们在和一帮畜生斗  -太可怕了
- We're dealing with animals here. - It's horrifying.

414
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,230
你知道我过去一直在尽量克制  但是
Now, you know I've always shown restraint in the past, but...

415
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,650
我打算发布行政命令  部署军事行动了
I'm going to be making an executive order for military action.

416
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,710
先空袭  然后地面部队进驻
Air strikes followed by ground troops.

417
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,700
你得向联合国提交报告
You'll need to present to the UN.

418
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,690
这个情报是哪来的
Where is this intelligence coming from?

419
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,560
简报里都写了
Well, it's all there in the briefing.

420
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,350
但既然我们知道这事会发生
But if we know this is going to happen,

421
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,100
我们为什么不提前制止呢
well, then why aren't we stopping it before it does?

422
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,770
弗兰西斯还留着你的辞职信
Francis held on to your resignation letter.

423
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,520
他想把它撕掉
And he wants to tear it up.

424
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,100
我知道这几个月来你多么艰辛
I know how difficult these past few months have been for you.

425
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,830
我们要求你做了很多
We've really asked a lot.

426
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,600
但等我们部署了军事行动
But once we're on the other side of this military action,

427
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,960
我们会准许你如愿离开政府
you have our blessing to leave the administration if you choose.

428
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,850
但当然  我们更希望你留下
But, of course, we'd prefer if you stay on.

429
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,520
希望这是不言自明的
Hope that goes without saying.

430
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,580
对平民使用
Using weapons of mass destruction

431
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,730
大规模杀伤性武器是战争罪
against civilians is a war crime.

432
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,290
我很感激有机会能完成此事
I appreciate the opportunity to see this through to the end.

433
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,370
我们就希望你会这么说
We were hoping you would say that.

434
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,670
谢谢你  凯茜
Thank you, Cathy.

435
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,210
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

436
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,060
你担心她吗
Are you worried about her?

437
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,010
我们得开始想
We need to start thinking about

438
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,360
我们身边的人了
the people we surround ourselves with.

439
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,490
这让我想到了汤姆
Which has made me think of Tom...

440
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,220
他现在已经没理由留在这里了  是吧
who doesn't really have a reason to be here anymore, does he?

441
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,750
没有正式理由
Not an official one, no,

442
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,000
但我想或许我们可以给他个顾问之名
but I thought maybe we could bring him on as a consultant.

443
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,090
当然  这取决于你
Well, of course, that's entirely up to you.

444
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,080
只是一天的时间和精力有限
There's just only so much time and energy in a single day,

445
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,710
我觉得我们该不断自省
and I think we need to constantly be asking ourselves,

446
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,820
"我是否尽可能明智地利用我的时间和精力了"
"Am I spending it as wisely as I can?"

447
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,740
-谢谢  -简  真抱歉
- Thank you. - Jane, I'm so sorry

448
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,280
-从派对上把你叫走  -没事
- to pull you away from your party. - No, no, no.

449
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,990
-当我在电话上听到你的声音  -我就是
- When I heard your voice on the phone... - I just... I just...

450
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,110
-我不知道该怎么办  -出什么事了吗
- I don't know what to do. - Did something happen?

451
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,620
安德伍德夫妇在计划
The Underwoods are planning

452
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,750
对霍姆斯进行空袭  增派军队
air strikes and a troop surge in Homs.

453
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,310
-太可怕了  -你了解这事吗
- How awful. - Do you know anything about this?

454
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,960
佩特罗夫把那里变成了地狱
Petrov is making the whole region a disaster.

455
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,930
没有哪个卷入中东局势的人能得到好处
No one who ever got tangled up in the Middle East came out ahead.

456
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,190
随佩特罗夫去吧
Let Petrov own it.

457
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,740
有可怕的事将要发生
There's something terrible that is going to happen...

458
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,510
我们可以阻止
that we can prevent.

459
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,570
这样啊
I see.

460
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,260
我要向联合国提交我方红线警告
I'm scheduled to present some kind of red line at the UN.

461
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,770
-但我们还可以退一步的  -我要怎么帮忙
- But we can still pull back. - How can I help?

462
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,890
跟总统和副总统谈谈
Talk to the president, the vice president.

463
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,740
我会的
I will.

464
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,400
他们真可怕  是吧
They're terrible, terrible people, aren't they?

465
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,840
简
Jane...

466
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,320
对他们一定要小心
be very careful with them.

467
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,820
当然
Of course.

468
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
这是老友的忠告
That's from an old friend.

469
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,340
我们还是朋友吧
Are we still friends?

470
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,760
当然
Of course.

471
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,990
他说总统接受的肝脏
He says the liver the president received

472
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,240
本该是给一个叫安东尼·莫雷蒂的人的
was supposed to go to a man named Anthony Moretti.

473
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,410
他说道格逼迫
And he says that Doug forced

474
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,610
当时的卫生和人类服务部部长
then Secretary of Health and Human Services

475
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,830
把总统排在名单最前
to put the president at the top of the list,

476
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,110
结果莫雷蒂因此死了
which resulted in Moretti's death.

477
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,330
道格还跟他的遗孀发生了关系
Oh, and Doug also has become involved with the man's widow.

478
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,430
干得漂亮
That's a nice touch.

479
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,780
他有证据吗
And does... does he have proof?

480
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,300
关于恋情吗  这个简单
About the relationship? It's easy to prove that.

481
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,440
名单的话  他知道梅瑞迪斯·李有所隐瞒
But the list, he knows that Meredith Lee is hiding something.

482
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,910
他打算再去找她谈
And he's ready to go back and talk to her about it.

483
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,050
你信任他吗
Do you trust him?

484
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,190
我不知道他干吗要编造这些
I don't know why he'd make any of this up.

485
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,470
我在外面
Hey, I'm outside.

486
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,520
你玩得开心吗
Did you have a good time?

487
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
我在这种场合已经开心不了了
I never do at those things anymore.

488
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,580
必要之恶
Necessary evils.

489
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,800
不像以前了
It's not like the old days,

490
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,090
你还能结识出人意料的人
when you used to meet surprising people.

491
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,260
是人们不那么出人意料了
Did people get less surprising

492
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
还是我们不容易被打动了
or are we less easily surprised?

493
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,950
是啊
Well, exactly.

494
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,710
-我的车来了  -她跟我问了你
- This is me. - She asked me about you.

495
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,800
-我猜到了  你怎么说的  -你...
- I figured. What'd you say? - That you're...

496
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,940
强大  什么的
formidable, etcetera.

497
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,580
我也这么跟他说你的  什么的
Yeah, I told him the same about you, etcetera.

498
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,990
他可以当个伟大的总统
He could be a great president.

499
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,440
但他想做吗
But does he want to be?

500
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,670
而且什么算伟大
And what is great?

501
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,390
还有她
And then there's her.

502
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,230
她怎么样
What about her?

503
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,770
她怎么了
What about her?

504
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,300
如果鲍勃或泰瑞是副主席
Because if Bob or Terry were the ranking member,

505
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,600
我就找他们了
I'd be talking to them.

506
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,160
我要罗梅洛做光杆司令
I want Romero's clerk stripped.

507
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,680
对  他给委员会成员的任何预算
Yeah, whatever budget he's got for his seat on that committee.

508
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,320
不不  我这是为了党派
No, no, I'm asking for the sake of the party.

509
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,870
杰姬·夏普的事我们躲过一劫  但这事没完
Look, we survived Jackie Sharp, but it's not gonna end there.

510
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,370
事实上  我在因为
The truth is I'm being punished

511
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,950
为我们选民最在乎的事抗争而受惩罚
for fighting for the issues that our base cares most about.

512
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,000
对  谢谢
Yes, and thank you.

513
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,740
道尔说几乎查不到厄舍的任何料
Doyle says there's almost nothing on Usher.

514
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,550
他喜欢赌博  一般能赢
He likes to gamble, usually wins.

515
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,490
但问题是  道尔找过马歇尔
But here's the thing... Doyle spoke with Marshall,

516
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,210
我们知道他离开康威团队时并不愉快
who we know did not have a happy exit from the Conway campaign.

517
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,820
他说  厄舍加入我们政府前
Now, he said that before Usher joined our administration,

518
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,440
他还打算培养罗梅洛竞选总统
he was grooming Romero for a presidential run.

519
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,690
先生  我认为他在两头讨好
Sir, I believe he's playing both sides

520
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,540
这个委员会的目标
of whatever this committee is after.

521
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,810
我不是民主党人  杰弗里
I'm not a Democrat, Jeffrey.

522
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,090
我还是共和党  只是碰巧在白宫工作
I'm still a Republican, just happen to work for the White House.

523
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,220
我是说  趁现在还行  控制下艾力克斯
All I'm saying is let's rein Alex in while we still can.

524
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,360
等他把自己的党派搅翻了天
'Cause after he rips through his own party,

525
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,910
就会去折腾我们党了  不是吗
he'll come after ours, wouldn't you think?

526
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,050
杰弗  你是主席
Yeah, and Jeff, you're the chair...

527
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,750
不  什么  不  听我说
No... What? No, listen.

528
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,150
等等  等等
Wait. Wait! Wait.

529
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,770
你欠我的  我们都知道
And you owe me, and we both know it,

530
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,910
这种事我不会大声说出来
and that's not the kind of thing I like to say out loud.

531
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,930
什么
What is?

532
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,400
什么时候的事
When did that happen?

533
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,560
确认了吗
Confirmed?

534
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,320
嗯
Yeah?

535
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,700
好吧
Yes, well...

536
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,100
沃克要作证
just because Walker's gonna take the stand,

537
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,130
不代表他会说什么  是吧
doesn't mean he'll say anything. Right?

538
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,380
你今早对我说的那个词是什么
What was that word you said to me this morning?

539
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,130
就是现在没人用了的那个
The one no one uses anymore?

540
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,380
黄昏的
Crepuscular.

541
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,000
对了
Right.

542
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,320
一些我最喜欢的动物就是晨昏性的
Some of my favorite animals are crepuscular.

543
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,380
喂
Yes.

544
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,550
什么
What?

545
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,600
什么时候
When?

546
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,250
天呐  该死
Jesus! God damn it!

547
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,600
克莱尔
Claire!

548
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,270
-克莱尔  -我在厨房
- Claire! - I'm in the kitchen.

549
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,140
沃克要作证
Walker's gonna testify.

550
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,800
-什么时候  -最早下周
- When? - Early as next week.

551
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,940
他会说他跟汉默施密特说的那些话
He's gonna say the same thing he said to Hammerschmidt.

552
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,240
不会有新伤害
There's not gonna be any new damage.

553
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,520
-我们不能确定  -我们去找厄舍
- We don't know that for sure. - Let's get Usher.

554
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,300
我早上肯定要找他
You bet I'm gonna talk to him in the morning.

555
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,370
你去哪
Where are you going?

556
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,120
在这房子里找块空荡的地方
To get some goddamn space in this house!

557
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,890
我可以解决沃克  我们给他开条件
I can take care of Walker. We'll make him an offer.

558
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,130
让他回到政坛
A place back on the stage,

559
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,270
去哪个资金雄厚的大学当校长  他会接受的
chancellor of some well-endowed university. He'll take it.

560
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,480
他可能会  但首先
He just might. But first,

561
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,670
我要知道你有罗梅洛什么料
I want to know what you have on Romero.

562
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,190
完全没有
I don't have a thing.

563
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,970
-得了  -道格  别失礼
- Please. - Doug, let's not be rude.

564
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,010
这我难以相信
I find that impossible to believe.

565
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,260
如果我知道  你会知道的
If I did, you would know it.

566
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,060
你和我都是老手了
You and I have been at this a long time.

567
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,870
你愿考虑一个候选人都肯定先审查过他
You wouldn't even consider a candidate without vetting him first.

568
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,010
我觉得艾力克斯很有前途
I thought Alex had a future.

569
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,140
是啊  就我所知可以竞选总统
Yeah, a run for the presidency as I understand it.

570
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,570
他像上浆的白衬衫一样干净
He's clean and crisp as a starched white shirt.

571
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,860
你得做出决定  马克
You're gonna have to make a decision, Mark.

572
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,940
是为我和克莱尔工作  还是怎么
You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?

573
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,670
我已经联络了我自己党派的人
I have already reached out to members of my own party.

574
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,070
我为帮助你动用了我的政治资本
I've used my political capital to help you.

575
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,530
但你还是没回答我的问题
But you're still not answering my question.

576
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,670
我已经回答了
I think I have.

577
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,560
我不需要让你或安德伍德夫人相信我的价值
And I don't need to convince you or Mrs. Underwood of my worth.

578
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,030
认识您很荣幸
It's an honor to meet you.

579
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,570
赛斯  杰弗瑞斯先生稍后会去找你
Seth, Mr. Jeffries will catch up with you momentarily.

580
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,820
我得长话短说了
I'm going to keep this brief.

581
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,140
如果你的说法是真的
If what you're saying is true...

582
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,600
道格·斯坦普救了我丈夫一命
Doug Stamper saved my husband's life.

583
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,060
是的
He did.

584
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,350
还因此害死了别人
And he also cost someone else his.

585
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,920
我猜你是那种有很多欲求的人
Well, I suspect you're the kind of man that wants many things.

586
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,420
但你犯了个错误
But you have made a mistake.

587
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,810
职业上讲  我只有一样一直渴求的东西
There's only one thing, professionally, that I've always wanted.

588
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,430
就是进白宫工作
It's to work in the White House.

589
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,240
赛斯会送你出去
Seth will see you out.

590
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,390
抱歉刚刚不得不走开
Sorry for the interruption.

591
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,210
你说到哪了
You were saying...

592
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,590
凯茜一直是个好人
Cathy was always a very good person.

593
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,260
她内心是的  她有良心
At her core, she has a core.

594
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,320
保佑她
Bless her.

595
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,390
霍姆斯的事对她可能太为难
This whole Homs initiative might be too difficult for her.

596
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,620
你让人很难读懂
You know... you're very hard to read.

597
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,080
这也合理
Which makes sense.

598
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,850
这几年来  你一直左右逢源
For the last several years, you've been a familiar face.

599
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,170
一定很累人
Must get exhausting.

600
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,080
你能跟他一起欢笑的人都很少吧
Must be hardly any people you can even share a laugh with.

601
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,350
你该想想该怎么好好利用我
You should figure out how to take full advantage of me.

602
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,990
我可以帮你如愿
I can help you get what you want.

603
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,570
如果你告诉我你的愿望
If you tell me what it is.

604
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,270
我喜欢帮助他人
I enjoy helping others.

605
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,320
我觉得你知道我的愿望
I think you know what I want.

606
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,180
是啊
Yes...

607
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,790
但你是现在想要  还是四年后要
But do you want it now or in four years?

608
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,100
我要全世界看到艾哈迈迪被逮捕
I want the whole world to see Ahmadi's capture...

609
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,080
铺天盖地的报道
on every news outlet and every screen.

610
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,060
为了党派利益  我更希望沃克先生不要作证
For the good of the party, I'd prefer Mr. Walker not testify.

611
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,150
我在考虑离开宣战委员会
I'm considering taking myself off the Declaration of War Committee.

612
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,350
艾力克斯  你不用那么做
Alex, you don't have to do that.

613
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,540
你可以随意怎么处置它
And you can do what you will with it.

614
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,700
但条件是总统要做正确的事
But that's conditional on the president doing the right thing.

615
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,300
是什么
And what is that?

616
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,880
辞职
Resigning.

617
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,510
再说一遍  我只是为党派考虑
Again, I'm only thinking of the party.

618
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,870
嗯
Yeah...

619
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,030
你他妈以为你是谁啊
Who the fuck do you think you are?

620
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,680
-别对我说粗话  -闭上臭嘴
- Oh, don't use that language with me... - Shut the fuck up.

621
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,800
你根本不知道你在做什么
You have no idea, none, about what you're doing.

622
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,630
请你离开我的办公室
I'd like you to leave my office.

623
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,970
你给我听好
Now you listen carefully to me.

624
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,710
-我说  -闭嘴  艾力克斯
- I said... - Shut up, Alex!

625
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
听听这个头条
Here's a headline for you.

626
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,300
"艾力克斯·罗梅洛勾结康威州长
"Alex Romero colluded with Governor Conway

627
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,290
利用宣战委员会
to use the Declaration of War Committee

628
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,700
帮他赢得大选"
to help him win an election."

629
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,560
-没有  -得了  你清楚你做了什么
- No. - Please, you know you did.

630
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,860
-看这多简单  -滚出去
- See how easy that is? - Get out!

631
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,000
听证会上只会有你一个人  我刚见过沃克
You're gonna be all alone at your hearing. I just left Walker.

632
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,560
他打算保持沉默  你会出丑的
He's gonna plead the Fifth. You'll look like a fool.

633
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,240
你想出头  没人介意
You want to be out front? No one has a problem with that.

634
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,630
他们希望你出头  因为你也会倒得最快
They want you there, because you'll be the first to fall.

635
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,500
"为了党派"
"For the good of the party."

636
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,800
做个好梦  议员
Sleep tight, Congressman.

637
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,560
-谁知道威尔的事  -暂时还没人
- Who knows about Will? - No one, not yet.

638
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,160
还有呢
What else?

639
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,430
我现在为什么还要保护你
Why I'm still protecting you at this point...

640
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,840
我自己都不明白
I don't even understand myself.

641
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,980
沃克打算保持沉默
Walker's gonna plead the Fifth.

642
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,880
罗梅洛也不会折腾
And Romero won't rock the boat.

643
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,860
多谢了  马克
Thank you, Mark, I appreciate that.

644
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,240
我建议你安排新闻发布会
I would suggest you schedule a press conference

645
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,640
就在听证会之后
for right after the hearing.

646
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,770
好
All right.

647
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,120
告诉我你做过的最恶劣的事
Tell me the worst thing you've ever done.

648
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,340
不好选
It's hard to pick.

649
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,500
-我说真的  -我也是
- I'm serious. - So am I.

650
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,000
假装爱一个我并不爱的人
Pretended to love someone when I didn't.

651
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,680
可以说  那是最糟的
In a way, that was the worst.

652
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,330
那人知道吗
Did the person know?

653
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,240
她假装不知道
She pretended not to know...

654
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,220
但她知道
but she knew.

655
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,210
她很难受
It was awful for her.

656
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,180
但我为那个错误付出了代价
But I paid for that mistake, too.

657
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,650
那种事  会伤害一个人
Those types of things, they take a toll.

658
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,050
真是奇妙  有些选择毫无意义
It's strange how some choices mean nothing

659
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,620
也有一些会决定你的余生
and others govern the rest of your life.

660
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,470
我做过一些可怕的事
I've done some terrible things.

661
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,900
你不用告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

662
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,950
弗兰西斯杀了佐伊·巴恩斯
Francis killed Zoe Barnes.

663
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,940
克莱尔
Claire.

664
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,830
弗兰西斯杀了彼得
Francis killed Peter.

665
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,740
别说了
Stop.

666
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,750
还会再死许多人
And so many more are gonna die.

667
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,830
别说了
Stop.

668
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,130
我不怕你
You don't scare me.

669
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,640
你该怕
I should.

670
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,600
艾丹
Aidan.

671
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,110
我不叫艾丹了
Not anymore.

672
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,470
你怎么到这儿来的
How did you get here?

673
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,740
有扇门开了  我就出来了
A door opened, I walked out.

674
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,440
听着不太对劲
That doesn't sound right.

675
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,530
我拿到了签证  和今晚的机票  我只是
I got a visa and a flight tonight. I just...

676
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,710
我只是想最后再来看看你
I just wanted to see you one last time.

677
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,670
等等  谁要送你走
Wait. Who's getting you out?

678
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,960
无所谓了
That doesn't matter.

679
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,010
-你说什么了  -其实什么都没说
- What did you say? - Honestly, nothing.

680
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,060
我们必须和安德伍德夫妇谈谈
We have to talk to the Underwoods.

681
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,950
-还是算了吧  -这根本说不通
- Nah, I don't think so. - This does not make sense.

682
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,990
你总是喜欢开好车
Well, you always liked to drive a nice car.

683
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,030
艾丹  跟我来吧  我来解决
Aidan, come with me. I'll fix this.

684
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,400
我还想让你跟我走呢  我也给你备了条出路
You come with me. I've a way for you to get out.

685
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,580
那好吧
Well, all right, then.

686
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,940
等到明天早上再告诉别人你见到了我
Now, don't you tell anybody you saw me until the morning.

687
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,080
我为什么还要告诉别人我见到了你
Why would I tell anyone I saw you at all?

688
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,190
不是吧
Really?

689
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,030
等等
Wait.

690
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,190
-给  拿上这个  -不行
- Here, take this. - No.

691
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,920
拿着  至少上飞机之前要拿着  好吗
Come on. At least until you get on the flight, all right?

692
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,730
我撤了
I'm out.

693
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,690
睡不着
Can't sleep?

694
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,870
外面这么冷  你该披上外套
It's freezing out here. You should have a coat on.

695
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,130
我喜欢
I like it.

696
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,820
别去见沃克
Don't meet with Walker.

697
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:56,940
我觉得这不是个好主意
I think it's a bad idea.

698
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,840
这会提醒他  他最好该怎么做
It'll remind him of his best course of action.

699
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,420
你错了  我很抱歉  但是你错了
You're wrong. I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

700
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
厄舍已经打点好了
Usher has it under control.

701
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,800
你总是想做什么就做什么
You always do what you want.

702
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,780
汤姆不想走
Tom doesn't want to leave.

703
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,360
汤姆没资格选
Tom doesn't get to choose.

704
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,950
外面冷  你进去吧
It's cold. You should go in.

705
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,720
能麻烦你把道格·斯坦普过去三年
If you could get me Doug Stamper's addresses

706
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,070
住过的所有地址给我...
for the last three years...

707
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,320
你知道瑞秋和丽萨的照片条
And do you know what happened to the photo strip

708
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,680
去哪了吗
of Rachel and Lisa?

709
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,640
不见了
It's gone.

710
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,650
我们得自己表明我们的立场
We need to lay out our positions ourselves.

711
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,130
我已经在去纽约的路上了
I'm already on my way to New York.

712
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,990
我不希望你说或者做什么
I don't want you to say or do anything

713
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,290
让你感到不舒服的事
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

714
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,340
我不会和政府立场相左的  我不希望这样
I won't contradict the administration. That's not my wish.

715
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,340
我们需要划下红线
We need to draw a line in the sand.

716
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,320
当然  我还上飞机吗
Yes, of course. Should I get on my flight?

717
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,390
我觉得你最好还是调头回来吧
I think it might be best if you turn around and come back.

718
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,230
听你的
Whatever you think.

719
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,990
就让沃克保持沉默吧
We'll let Walker plead the Fifth.

720
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,090
然后我们再碰头协调立场
Then we'll regroup and make sure we're on the same page.

721
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,740
好吧  调头回去吧
Okay. We need to head back.

722
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,100
"当心纠缠不清的联盟"  总统先生
"Beware entangling alliances," Mr. President.

723
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,980
通常都认为这句话出自华盛顿
You know, that quote is often attributed to Washington,

724
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,280
但其实是杰斐逊说的
but it was actually Jefferson who said it.

725
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,050
总之我想先来见见你
Anyway, I wanted to catch you before,

726
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,310
赶在马克和你的律师来之前
Mark and your lawyer got here.

727
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,530
总统先生
Mr. President.

728
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,840
我知道这对你并不轻松
I know this hasn't been easy for you.

729
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,230
其实一个人的适应能力几乎不可限量
Well, the truth is, one can get used to almost anything.

730
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,690
总之  恭喜你
Well, at any rate, congratulations.

731
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,730
你就要担任国内
You're about to become the chancellor

732
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,360
顶尖大学的校长了
of one of our finest universities.

733
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,860
我们为名誉付出的代价高昂
It's a high price we pay for respectability.

734
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,480
总之  我就是来打个招呼
Anyway, I just wanted to say hello.

735
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,690
并且感谢你所做的一切
And to thank you for all you're doing.

736
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,650
用不了多久
In not too long,

737
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,170
你就会和那些前总统一样
you're going to become one of those ex-presidents

738
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,200
你的成就会让大家
whose work will make everyone...

739
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,840
忘记过去
forget the past.

740
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,410
我也曾是美国总统
I was once the President of the United States.

741
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,160
没错  你的确是
Yes, you were.

742
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,740
然后总统之位被你偷走了  弗兰克
You stole the presidency, Frank.

743
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,870
别这么说  加勒特
Now, Garrett...

744
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,550
都是好久以前的事了
This is ancient history,

745
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,580
但以现代政治的标准来看
but by modern political standards,

746
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,820
我是以压倒性优势当选的
my election was a landslide.

747
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,470
我原本打算改变这个国家
I was gonna change this country.

748
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:58,050
但后来  发生了一些事
But then... uh, things happen.

749
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,330
人们说谎
People lie...

750
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,680
为与他们同步你只好也撒谎
You lie to keep up.

751
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:05,670
你一直以来被称赞的优点
The things that you've been lauded for all your life,

752
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,460
突然都成了致命缺陷
those are suddenly fatal flaws.

753
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,770
曾经和你风雨同舟的人
People who've been with you through thick and thin,

754
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,630
你以为永远不会辜负你的人  还是辜负你了
who you thought would never fail you, they fail you.

755
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,970
你会和讨厌的人结成别扭的同盟
You make strange alliances with unsavory people.

756
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,050
当一切清晰起来时  已经太晚
And it all becomes clear way too late.

757
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,450
其他任何人都不会真正明白
And no one else truly understands.

758
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,870
除了就任过的人
Except someone who's been in the office...

759
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,660
你不能指望这个职位
You can't expect the office

760
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,210
能放大你的能力
to do anything more than what you bring to it.

761
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,380
-我这么做是为党的利益  -我知道
- I'm doing this for the party. - I know.

762
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,610
这令人钦佩
And it's admirable.

763
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,460
特莉莎怎么样
How's Tricia?

764
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,970
我们挺好  虽然花了些时间
Well, it's taken time, but we are good.

765
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,650
孩子们也都很好
The kids are doing well.

766
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,420
这只是开始
Well, this is just the beginning.

767
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,980
今后  你我会有更多的合作
You and I are gonna be working a lot more together from now on.

768
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,060
真的吗
Is that so?

769
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,430
道格
Doug.

770
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,450
汤姆  今天上午很忙
Tom, it's a busy morning.

771
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,320
我现在不能提供任何引述
I don't have any quotes right now.

772
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,500
等你有时间  我想坐下来
When you have a moment, i'd like to sit down

773
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,800
问你几个关于丽萨·威廉姆斯的问题
and ask you some questions about Lisa Williams.

774
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,230
不好意思  你在说什么
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

775
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,700
等你有时间  和我说一声  道格
Let me know when you're free, Doug.

776
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,540
如果你想要一个声明
If you'd like a statement,

777
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,550
赛斯·格雷森的办公室很快会发一篇新闻稿
Seth Grayson's office will be issuing a press release shortly.

778
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,380
你住在杜邦环岛附近  对吧
You live near Dupont Circle, don't you?

779
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,030
我可以正式宣称  是的  我住那附近
I will go on the record and say yes, I do.

780
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,700
沃克总统
President Walker,

781
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,390
希瑟·邓巴的
it's been established in

782
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,190
特别检察官报告中明确称
Heather Dunbar's special prosecutor's report

783
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:25,870
我们有理由...
that we have reason to--

784
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,090
议员  我已向主席
Congressman, as I mentioned to the chair

785
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,360
和委员会的其他成员提过
and the other distinguished members of the committee,

786
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,080
我建议我的委托人
I am advising my client

787
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,880
目前对关于他就任美国总统期间的所有问题
to plead the Fifth at this time for all questions regarding his tenure

788
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,320
行使第五修正案的权利
as President of the United States of America.

789
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,420
同为民主党人  我得说
I must say, uh, that as a fellow Democrat,

790
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,480
这很不寻常
this is highly irregular.

791
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,800
是的  议员  的确
Yes, Congressman, yes.

792
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,290
但鉴于目前进行的调查...
But in light of ongoing investigations--

793
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,570
其实  我愿意回答议员的问题
Actually, I will answer the congressman's questions.

794
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,360
请提问吧
Please, ask your question.

795
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,640
你任总统期间
Under your administration,

796
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,450
有来自中国商人的数百万美元资金
millions of dollars were illegally laundered

797
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,320
经非法洗钱  影响了美国大选
from Chinese businessmen to affect American elections.

798
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,990
是真的吗
Is this true?

799
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,550
对  是真的
Yes. That's true.

800
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,970
你能否告诉我们
And can you tell us what, if any,

801
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,720
时任副总统弗兰西斯·安德伍德
was then Vice President Francis Underwood's

802
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,750
在其中的参与情况  如果有的话
involvement in this scheme?

803
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,500
他似乎是其中一名总设计师
Well, it appeared to me, he was one of its chief architects.

804
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,880
你这话是什么意思  先生
And, uh, what exactly do you mean by that, sir?

805
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:36,630
那是他的主意
It was his idea.

806
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,830
马克  你还是去别的地方吧
Mark, I think you need to be elsewhere right now.

807
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:43,740
我们要对此采取回避态度吗
Are we gonna bury our heads in the sand with this?

808
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,340
不是  你要离开
No, you're going to leave,

809
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,350
副总统和我来决定怎么做
and the vice president and I are going to decide what to do.

810
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,960
沃克食言了  我们说好了的
Walker reneged. We had a deal.

811
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,790
如果需要你  我们会告诉你的
We will let you know if you are needed.

812
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,890
-先生  -这不是请求
- Sir... - That was not a request.

813
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,080
你为什么非要去和他谈
Why did you have to go talk to him?

814
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,700
一定会有出路的  弗兰西斯
There has to be a way out, Francis.

815
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,850
是吗  有吗
Does there? Is there?

816
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,940
这就是我的总统任期吗
Or is this my presidency?

817
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,300
永远是攻击目标
Forever with a target on my back.

818
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,900
被纠缠  被追捕
Haunted and hunted.

819
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,960
莉安  如果你听到这个  说明我死了
LeAnn, if you're hearing this, it means that I'm dead.

821
00:54:38,900 --> 00:55:18,900
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}1958年以前  美国总统是没有退休金的
所以杜鲁门退休离开华盛顿时  生活极度窘迫
自己开着车回到老家密苏里  买不起房子  只好去亲戚家住
同年的《前总统法案》规定给退休总统发放等额于内阁部长工资的退休金
总统们的退休生活才有了基本保障  
克林顿退休时正当壮年  闲不住的他成立了克林顿基金会  到处做慈善
一度成为世界上最影响力的基金会之一
但在2016年大选中  克林顿基金会的募资受到了广泛质疑
一些人指出  许多外国政府和团体可能是因为希拉里做了国务卿才会捐款

823
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:48,900
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}大小布什两父子总统  退休后基本上都选择了不问世事的隐居生活
两个人都回到了德州  老布什落户休斯顿  小布什选择了达拉斯
老布什相对更活跃一些  会出席一些公开活动
任上毁多誉少的小布什则更加低调  除了一些必须参加的活动
更多把精力放在了为非洲做慈善  以及支持老兵权益的一些活动中  
为打发时间  他还开始学习绘画  而且现在油画作品颇有成就
2016年出版了一本画册  销量非常好

825
00:55:48,900 --> 00:56:28,900
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}刚退休不到半年的奥巴马  花了很多时间去欧洲和加勒比海度假
随行的都是富商名流  出入都是喷气飞机  豪华游艇
但豪华假日只是表象  奥巴马的手下在华盛顿租了一间办公室
同政府的现任官员联系紧密
现总统特朗普遭遇一连串丑闻后  其支持者指责奥巴马
在背后暗中支持反对特朗普的政治力量
按惯例退休总统都会离开华盛顿
但奥巴马以想保证女儿读完高中为由  退休后在华盛顿租了一间豪宅
不久前  媒体报道他出资八百万美元把这栋豪宅买了下来
看来短期内他是不会离开美国的政治中心了
