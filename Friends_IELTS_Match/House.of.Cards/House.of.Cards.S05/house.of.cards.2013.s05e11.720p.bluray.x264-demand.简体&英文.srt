加勒特·沃克的证词非常确凿
Garrett Walker's testimony couldn't be more damning.

28
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,930
弗兰西斯·安德伍德是中国资金
Francis Underwood is front and center in a scheme

29
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,890
影响美国选举的阴谋的罪魁祸首
that had Chinese money influencing an American election.

30
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,790
这是一位声名狼藉  怀恨在心的前总统的证词
Testimony from a disgraced and disgruntled former president.

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,550
他为什么现在才发声
Why is he just speaking up now?

32
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,750
你是说他们不应该
Well, are you suggesting that they shouldn't...

33
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,020
重视沃克的话吗
take what Walker said seriously? I mean...

34
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,930
如果是真的  为什么沉默了那么久
If it's true, why stay silent so long?

35
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,090
一旦事态升级
Which is a question I'm sure

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,470
我相信司法委员会一定会问这个问题
the Judiciary Committee will ask once it's up and going.

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,910
据我所知  弹劾状最早会在周末前
My sources say articles of impeachment could be voted on

38
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,450
进行投票表决
as early as the end of the week.

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,140
众议院没那么有效率
Now as if the House is that efficient.

40
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,750
沃克总统才是该被审查的人
Look, President Walker is the one who should be scrutinized here.

41
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,770
他见人说人话  见鬼说鬼话
He's talking out of both sides of his mouth.

42
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,470
别忘了
And let's not forget,

43
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,800
他过去还有
he has had some emotional problems

44
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,110
-情绪问题  -安德伍德被考虑
- in the past. - Underwood has disrespected

45
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,620
作为国务卿人选之前
the presidency since before he was thought of

46
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,400
-就藐视总统一职  -你被这宣传攻势蒙蔽了
- for Secretary of State... - You seem blinded by this crusade.

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,310
-当时他还是党鞭  -你们  等等
- ...when he was nothing more than the House Whip. - You guys, wait.

48
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,000
如果安德伍德被弹劾  那么
If Underwood is impeached, then...

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,870
那只是假设  这很危险
That's a hypothetical. It's dangerous.

50
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,840
没错
Fair. Well...

51
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,840
汤姆  总统被弹劾后
Tom, where would impeachment leave

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,300
副总统克莱尔·安德伍德会怎样
Vice President Claire Underwood?

53
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,380
进入总统办公室  当总统
In the Oval, as president.

54
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,170
如果那样的话
What their arrangement would be,

55
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,220
他们会怎么办  就难说了
in that case, is anybody's guess.

56
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,430
赛斯  第一夫妇现在情况如何
Seth, what is this like right now for the first couple?

57
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,520
他们在回避这些纷扰
They're avoiding all of this distraction.

58
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,350
他们在继续为美国人民服务
They're continuing to do the work of the American people.

59
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,270
-党内警告  -不行
- Censure. - No.

60
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,360
我理解马克的意思
I see Mark's point.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,220
根本不可能阻止众议院的共和党人
There is no way to stop the Republicans in the House.

62
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,670
沃克不是可信的证人
Walker's not a reliable witness.

63
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,920
他的证词能被核实吗
Is what he said verifiable?

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,370
所以弹劾在所难免
So, impeachment is inevitable.

65
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,680
好吧  那只是假设
Well, that's... that's a presumption.

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,020
民主党掌权的参议院
The Democratic Senate

67
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,250
不会愿意弹劾民主党总统
will not be inclined to remove a Democratic president.

68
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,690
但他们需要政治掩护
But they need political cover.

69
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,390
党内警告能满足他们
Censure will help them with that.

70
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,460
他们可能提出其他的惩罚
I mean, they might propose other penalties,

71
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,450
罚款  谴责声明
a fine, a statement of condemnation

72
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,530
但他们不会去证实犯罪行为
but they'll stop short of finding criminal wrongdoing.

73
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,410
但如果进展得快  大家都能继续前进了
And if it happens quickly, everyone can move on.

74
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,860
你俩私下商量过这件事吗
Did you two get together on this privately?

75
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,770
没有
No.

76
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,070
弗兰西斯  这是挽救你第一任期的办法
Francis, this is one way to salvage your first term.

77
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,720
沃克本该保持沉默的
Walker was supposed to plead the Fifth.

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,330
事情出现了意外变化
Well, things took an unexpected turn.

79
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,950
对  他违背了协议
Yes. He went back on his deal,

80
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,370
因为他和自己的证词一样不可靠
because he's as pliable as his testimony.

81
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,920
马克  我不会被众议院弹劾
Mark, I will not be impeached in the House

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,760
那绝对到不了参议院
and it will never get to the Senate.

83
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,370
我们要让加勒特·沃克名誉扫地
We will destroy Garrett Walker's credibility

84
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,470
这事便会不攻自破
and the case will fall apart.

85
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,430
好吧
Okay.

86
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,550
我能得到豁免权吗
Can I get immunity?

87
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,460
看你能提供什么信息
Depends on what you give them.

88
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,910
我会联系副主席
I'll reach out to a ranking member,

89
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,480
但你无法匿名
but you're not gonna get anonymity...

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,370
凯茜
Cathy.

91
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,680
-简  -你好
- Jane. - Hello?

92
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,350
我为你牵肠挂肚  你能相信发生这种事吗
You've been on my mind. Can you believe what's going on?

93
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,780
抱歉失陪一下
Excuse me for a moment.

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,830
就像我母亲说的  "简直是一团乱麻"
As my mother used to say, "It's a red hot mess."

95
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,490
弗兰克·安德伍德倒霉不代表你也得遭殃
Frank Underwood's demise doesn't have to be yours.

96
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,440
还有许多非营利性
There are non-profits,

97
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,160
民间组织非常希望和你合作
NGOs that would be dying to work with you.

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,350
据我所知  我的工作还没丢
Well, as far as I know, I still have a job.

99
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,950
当然没有
No, of course.

100
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,290
但谁知道他们接下来会去查谁
But who knows who they'll come after next?

101
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,590
我本来就不是核心圈子的人
I was never part of their inner circle.

102
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,230
你找莫琳很聪明  她是个好律师
You were smart to go with Maureen. She's a good lawyer.

103
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,940
要说谁能帮你全身而退  就是她了
If someone can find you an exit, it's her.

104
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,010
我不会就这么轻易退场的
Well, I'm not gonna go away easily,

105
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,340
所以多谢你的关心  简
so thank you for your concern, Jane.

106
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
我是关心
It is concern.

107
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,120
你认为副总统
do you think the vice president

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,890
知道这些事情吗
had any knowledge of this stuff?

109
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,760
我说了  我真的不知道
Well, as I said, I have no idea.

110
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,950
如果克莱尔挺过这关  成了总统
If... if Claire survives this and becomes president,

111
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,750
那你要怎么办
where does that leave you?

112
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,410
我好歹也打拼了三十多年  简
Well, I've been at this for 30 years, Jane,

113
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,170
我想我还是能挺过去的
so I think I can survive.

114
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,350
亲爱的  我不是想吓唬你
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to alarm you.

115
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,400
我也没害怕
I'm not alarmed.

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,260
我只是想说
All I'm trying to say,

117
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,830
我支持你
I'm on your side.

118
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,450
如果是在继续当总统还是下台之间选择的话
If it's the difference in being in office or being out,

119
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,960
我们可以想办法绕过去
we can work around that.

120
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,780
戴着手铐想办法吧
Working in handcuffs.

121
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,060
党内警告是个挫折  但还没有输
Censure is a setback. It's not a loss.

122
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,610
你还真是自信满满  执拗得很啊
You're very confident and very insistent.

123
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,830
我们会撑过去的  弗兰西斯
We can come out of this, Francis.

124
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,860
你是说你自己吧
No, you mean you can.

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,150
哪怕就一次  你能不能
Can you, for once,

126
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,560
干脆点  接受开价  别再还价了
just take something at face value instead of fighting it?

127
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,760
就好像我过去造的孽能洗清似的
As if I can be washed clean of past sins.

128
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,070
-你认识我多久了  -很久了
- How long have you known me? - Forever.

129
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,600
那你有多了解我
How well do you know me?

130
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,290
就算你克莱尔·安德伍德
How, in your wildest imagination,

131
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,770
再怎么尽情发动想象力
could you, Claire Underwood,

132
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,010
也不该以为我会接受这个
think I would be okay with this?

133
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,240
求你考虑一下吧
Think about it, please.

134
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,090
这关乎我的总统之位
This is the fate of my presidency!

135
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,880
人民想原谅你
The people want to forgive you.

136
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,250
接受吧
Let them.

137
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,290
快点出来  再给我讲讲
Come out here already. Give me the rest of it.

138
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,700
汉默施密特是个彻头彻尾的工作狂
Hammerschmidt is a straight-up workaholic.

139
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,170
但是他就快查出什么了
But... he's getting close.

140
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,820
线索慢慢拼凑起来了
Putting the pieces together.

141
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,230
他还查得这么起劲做什么
What's he still grinding so hard for?

142
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,520
看来沃克就要扳倒安德伍德了
Looks like Walker's gonna bring Underwood down.

143
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,210
我不想再谈工作了
I don't wanna do this anymore.

144
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,080
佐伊·巴恩斯  瑞秋·波斯纳
Zoe Barnes. Rachel Posner.

145
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,490
肖恩  别说了
Sean, please, I...

146
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,950
是我想把他的调查拉回来
I was the one trying to get him back on that.

147
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,160
-结果害得我被解雇了  -能不说这些了吗
- That's what got me fired. - Can we stop talking about this?

148
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,510
-我的酒呢  -别这样
- Where's my drink? - Don't do that.

149
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,350
看着我  看我
Look at me. Look.

150
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,960
我这就  不说了
This is me... not talking.

151
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,390
过来  过来
Come here. Come here.

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,490
如果有我能帮忙的地方  就告诉我
But if I can be of any help, you let me know.

153
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,490
看我不收拾你
You're gonna get it.

154
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,620
让我也喝一口
Give me a taste of that.

155
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,460
慢点
Slow down.

156
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,930
靠边停
Pull over!

157
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,250
你今天骑得很使劲啊  总统先生  还好吗
You're going pretty hard, Mr. President. You okay?

158
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,070
对于一个命运悬而未决的人来说  够好的了
Well enough for a man whose fate is hanging in the balance.

159
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,900
不对
No.

160
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,850
你的命运已经定了
Your fate is sealed.

161
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,990
怎么说
Oh, how's that?

162
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,630
你又"预见"到了什么了吗  艾瑞克
You have a vision for me, Eric?

163
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,660
就算你被弹劾定罪
Even if you're impeached and convicted...

164
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,220
你还是会创造历史
you still make history.

165
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,390
奥古斯都·安德伍德只是又一个
Augustus Underwood was just another redneck

166
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,230
选错了立场的农民罢了
who died fighting for the wrong side,

167
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,350
除了你和我没人记得住他
forgotten by everyone but you and me.

168
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,650
但如果弗兰西斯·安德伍德下台了呢
But if Francis Underwood is removed from office?

169
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,320
你的遗产也不会消散
Your legacy won't die.

170
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,480
反而会更加牢固
It'll be solidified.

171
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,590
你会遗臭万年
You'll be infamous.

172
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,550
政治遗产和遗臭万年可不是一回事
Legacy and infamy are not the same thing.

173
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,030
你将被人铭记  谁在乎原因呢
You'll be remembered. Who cares why?

174
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,510
我得回去了
I have to get back.

175
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,670
等等  听我解释一下
Hold up. Let me explain.

176
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,740
弗兰西斯
Francis.

177
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,350
弗兰西斯
Francis.

178
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,310
弗兰西斯
Francis?

179
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,470
我说清楚
Just to be clear,

180
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,290
我其实一直都知道你在看着我
it's not that I haven't always known you were there.

181
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,140
只是我对你的情感很复杂
It's that I have mixed feelings about you.

182
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,240
我质疑你的意图
I question your intentions...

183
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,850
而且我对关注感到矛盾
and I'm ambivalent about attention.

184
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,970
但别当我是针对你
But don't take it personally.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,470
我对每个人的感觉几乎都是这样的
It's how I feel about most everybody.

186
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,890
我们怎能相信他说的话呢
How can we trust anything he says?

187
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,920
加勒特·沃克任总统期间一直在用药
Garrett Walker was medicated while he was in office.

188
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,140
这我们都知道
We all know that.

189
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,660
不  这不是论据  这是事实
No, it's not a talking point. It's the truth.

190
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,870
我们不知道他具体用的什么药
We don't know exactly what he was taking.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,670
私下说
Off the record...

192
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,270
你能告诉我汤姆·汉默施密特在忙什么吗
can you tell me what Tom Hammerschmidt's working on?

193
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,790
拜托  你们俩在那儿就没有交集吗
Come on, you two don't cross paths over there?

194
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,470
他为了一篇报道联系过我
He reached out to me on a story.

195
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,880
之后就没回音了
I never heard back.

196
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,300
好  谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

197
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,980
随便你相不相信他说的
You can believe what he's saying or not.

198
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,000
但加勒特·沃克在服药...
But Garrett Walker was taking serious medication...

199
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,570
千万不要把一个陌生的U盘
Never... never put an unknown flash drive

200
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,250
插在联网的电脑上  千万不要
into a networked computer. Never.

201
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,980
你不用一直说这话
You don't have to keep telling me.

202
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,130
-是我叫你来的  记得吗  -记得
- I called you, remember? - Yeah.

203
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,930
好  看看能糟糕到哪里去
Okay. Do your worst.

204
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,570
好  目前来看都还好
Okay. So far so good.

205
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
有东西
There is something.

206
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,330
谢谢
Thank you.

207
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,630
我得挂了
I have to go.

208
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,030
没事吧
Everything okay?

209
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,130
-现在不方便  -今晚见
- Not now. - See you tonight?

210
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,720
等我忙完了给你打回去
I'll call you when I'm done.

211
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,000
我觉得出现了泄密者
I think there's a leak.

212
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,550
安德伍德政府的
In the Underwood Administration.

213
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,650
不知道
No idea.

214
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,980
不  这话说得有点早
Well, no, that's a little premature.

215
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,990
这不是水门事件  现在还不是
This isn't Watergate... yet.

216
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,040
嗯
Yeah.

217
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,490
好
Okay.

218
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,410
艾力克斯
Alex.

219
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,140
司法委员会是不可能了
So... Judiciary won't be happening for you.

220
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,390
只有零星几个民主党人的位置
Just the few slots for Democrats.

221
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,420
都刚被领导层安排了
Leadership just filled those

222
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,920
保守派民主党人  抱歉
with a couple of old Blue Dogs. Sorry.

223
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,580
有一件事你倒是说对了
Well, you were right about one thing.

224
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,750
加勒特的证词没有让我交到朋友
Garrett's testimony did not make me any friends.

225
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,630
在你们党不行
Not in your party, no.

226
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,330
今天早晨  我正式成为无党派议员了
Well, as of this morning, I'm officially an independent.

227
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,880
我觉得共和党能给我在司法委员会找个差事
I think the GOP can find me a place on judiciary.

228
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,240
-好吧  艾力克斯  -这一步很明智
- Okay, Alex. - It's a good move.

229
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,600
四年后
Four years from now,

230
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,520
我觉得选民们会想要一个局外人的
I think an outsider's what the voter will be looking for.

231
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,480
是啊  未来属于第三党候选人
Yeah, third-party candidate is the future,

232
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,970
而且永远都是
and always will be.

233
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,230
加勒特·沃克为什么改主意了
Why did Garrett Walker change his mind?

234
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,310
不是我让他改主意的
It wasn't me who made that happen.

235
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,900
我不知道
I don't know.

236
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,110
有时我们不知为何  但事情就发生了
Sometimes things happen without us knowing why.

237
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,090
他们逮捕了一个他们明知清白的人
They arrested someone they knew was innocent.

238
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,560
-斯坎伦州长否认了  -他当然会了
- Governor Scanlon denies it. - Of course he does.

239
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,520
-而国安局无可奉告  -一贯如此
- And the NSA has no comment. - As a rule.

240
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,620
不行  出去
No, out. Get out.

241
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,850
请五分钟后再来
Five minutes, please.

242
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,730
谢谢
Thank you.

243
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,940
联调局确认他们逮捕了卡拉比
The FBI confirms that they arrested Kalabi

244
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,240
他正在候审  但仅此而已
and that he's awaiting trial, but that's all.

245
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,750
没错  仅此而已
That's right, that's all.

246
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,640
但是有联调局的探员
But there are agents in the FBI

247
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,830
对此案的处理方式很不满
who were not happy with the way this went down.

248
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,680
而且没有一个人允许我们
And not one of them will let us

249
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,600
公开他们的姓名
use their name on the record.

250
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
我们无法核实
We can't confirm the story.

251
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,360
汤姆  这么大的事没有消息源是不能发的
Tom, we can't run a story this big without a source.

252
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,430
-我知道  -本报从来没这么做过
- No. I know. I know. - This paper has never done that.

253
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,600
-我知道  -谁知道是什么人给你发的
- I know. - Who knows who sent you this?

254
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,120
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

255
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,450
我需要你帮我放个料出去
I need you to float something out for me.

256
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,350
给头条网
Give it to Slugline.

257
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,850
你要我怎么说
What do you want me to say?

258
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,340
就说你在办公室偶然看到
You picked it up here in the office.

259
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,730
虽然没查实
It's not confirmed...

260
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,030
但似乎值得报道
but it seems like a story.

261
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,740
去印出来吧
Go ahead and print it.

262
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,350
我对你这么做完全不知情
And I had no idea you're doing this.

263
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,820
操  我操  操操操
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

264
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,920
在我看来
Well, it looks to me like

265
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,060
安德伍德团队错误逮捕了一名
the Underwood campaign had a Muslim visiting the US

266
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,410
访美穆斯林  就为了
wrongly arrested in order to

267
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,370
能在大选日影响选情
influence the vote on Election Day.

268
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,600
如果你相信这个
And if you believe that,

269
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,930
那你就不得不质疑
then you have to ask some questions

270
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,580
这对田纳西州选情的影响有多大
about the impact this had on the results in Tennessee,

271
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,490
当时各方均预计安德伍德总统会输掉田州
where President Underwood was predicted to lose.

272
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,080
我们都知道哈里发国的威胁是真实的
We all know that ICO is a real threat.

273
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,410
没人否认这一点  而且我
Nobody is denying that, and I...

274
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,100
今天不要转接电话进来
No calls get through to me, not today.

275
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,770
如果有媒体问你
And if you get pressed,

276
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,380
就说白宫目前没有任何评论
the White House has no comment at this time.

277
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,200
好  先生
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,390
拜托你人走关门
Close the door behind you, please.

279
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,560
这事你知道多少
What do you know about this?

280
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,780
首先  你这么问什么意思
First of all, what are you getting at?

281
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,880
其次  如果我知情的话
And secondly, if I had any information,

282
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,580
我也肯定不会瞒着不报
I wouldn't be keeping it to myself.

283
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,250
赛斯  我就跟你直说了
Seth, I am asking you straight up.

284
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,700
如果你知道什么  现在就告诉我
If you know anything, you tell me now.

285
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,590
-别等我动手去查  -不然呢
- Don't make me find out. - Or what?

286
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,830
你想怎么办  道格
What are you gonna do, Doug?

287
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,560
拿白宫马克杯闷死我吗
You gonna suffocate me with a White House mug?

288
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,250
局面已经失控了
The shit is hitting the fan

289
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,530
如果我们再不赶快动手
and we're all going to be covered in it

290
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,860
就都会被牵连进去
if we don't get to work.

291
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,820
请问  我可以继续忙了吗
Now... can I please get back to it?

292
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,180
妈的
Shit.

293
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,610
我们只需要启动
We're essentially turning on

294
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,720
一台早已就位的设备
an apparatus that's already in place.

295
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,820
我们会打开音频接收
We'll enable audio capabilities.

296
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,000
所有电话  电邮和短信
All calls, e-mails, messages

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,390
进出白宫的一切通讯

搜索泄密者期间每通电话都会被录音

300
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,830
视频监控呢

301
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,520
我们可以再加装设备
We can install additional devices,

302
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,540
-可是  -用现成的就行
- but... - We use what's already there.

303
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,330
我们将能够监视监听白宫所有职员的
It enables us to look and listen in on every computer

304
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,210
每一台电脑和手机

305
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,810
我们会成立一个卫星监控办公室

306
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,930
成员仅限我本人和斯坦普先生

307
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,980

308
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,550
会汇报任何有价值的情报

309
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,330
我想要直接访问权

311

我向您保证  总统先生

312
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,890
有什么有用内容我们都会呈递给您

去吧
Do it.

314
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,810
不用说
And needless to say...

315
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,920
我只向您汇报  先生
I report only to you, sir.

316
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,520
我要知道是谁在坑我
I wanna know who did this to me.

317
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,880
我去查  先生
I'm on it, sir.

318
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,480
你对道格有顾虑吗
You're having doubts about Doug?

319
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
-怎么  你有吗  -没有  就是
- Why? Are you? - No, I'm just...

320
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,770
我现在大概质疑一切了
I'm questioning everything, I guess.

321
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,380
这事解决之前
Until this is resolved,

322
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,720
你和我对于我们的言行
you and I should be very careful

323
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,100
要万分小心了
about what we say or do.

324
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,200
我们的私人需求得放到一边
And our personal needs have to be put aside.

325
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,300
你了解一些人  认识他们多年
You know people. You know them for years.

326
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,920
而突然  他们就像出现在你厨房里的陌生人
And then... suddenly they're like strangers in your kitchen.

327
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,730
熟悉和陌生只有一线之隔
Familiar can turn foreign on a dime.

328
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,990
-我能做什么吗  -你可以别妄动
- Is there anything I can do? - You can be quiet.

329
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,140
道格  我可不是泄密者  你知道的
Doug, I am not the leak here. You know that.

330
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,470
-我会再联系  -别挂
- I'll be in touch. - Don't hang up.

331
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,580
要我列出我为本届政府
Do I need to make a list of the risks

332
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,080
冒的风险吗
I've taken for this administration?

333
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,990
都是我从未做过的事
Things I have never done before.

334
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,410
我们当面谈吧  好吗
Let's just talk in person, okay?

335
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,870
谁啊
Yes?

336
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,700
请找莉安·哈维
LeAnn Harvey, please.

337
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,260
-是谁  -联调局
- Who is it? - FBI.

338
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,460
如果你能想到什么
If you think of anything,

339
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,220
名片最下面是我的手机号
that's my cell at the bottom of the card.

340
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,640
是自杀吗
Was it a suicide?

341
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,330
枪管抵着他的眼睛
Barrel of the gun was pressed against his eye, so...

342
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,620
你是他的联系人  他会做出这样的事吗
You were his contact. Would he do something like that?

343
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,210
我觉得不会
I don't think so.

344
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,810
或许他没有
Well, maybe he didn't.

345
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,580
-那枪呢  -问题就在这里
- And the gun? - That's the thing.

346
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,830
不见了
It's not there.

347
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,820
或许是酒店的住客或员工拿走了
Maybe someone staying at the hotel or working there took it.

348
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,090
你们会告知我吧
You'll let me know?

349
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,630
当然
Yeah. Sure.

350
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,910
马克
Mark...

351
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,840
副总统和我商量了
the vice president and I have discussed it and...

352
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,780
我们接受你的立场了
we've come around to your position.

353
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,750
很好
Very good.

354
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,150
鉴于现在爆出的新闻
Uh, considering the news that's breaking,

355
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,760
恐怕不会那么容易了
it's not going to be quite as easy.

356
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,270
知道消息是哪来的吗
Any idea where this story came from?

357
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,480
还不知道  但很快就会知道
No, not yet. But I will soon.

358
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,270
我会告诉他们你愿接受党内警告
I'll let it be known that you're open to censure.

359
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,600
你该知道
And you should be aware.

360
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,370
这并不意外
It's not surprising.

361
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,920
罗梅洛要进入司法委员会了
Romero is moving over to the Judiciary Committee.

362
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,510
他为什么不呢
Well, why wouldn't he?

363
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,660
他想把这事做到底  他还没放过我呢
He wants to see this through. He's still coming after me.

364
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,430
我猜两方的领导层都已经受够他了吧
Well, I imagine leadership from both parties has had enough of him.

365
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,550
嗯  我不想往小了说
Yeah, I don't want to diminish this.

366
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,820
我们在控制损失
We are in damage control.

367
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,000
克莱尔  我觉得
Claire, I think...

368
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,940
或许你最好还是
it might be best for you to

369
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,920
尽量别掺和这事
stay out of this as much as possible.

370
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,520
不  我要维护总统
No, I... I will defend the president.

371
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,020
我觉得最好是
Vice presidential business as usual

372
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,980
副总统一切照旧
is the way to play it, I think.

373
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,840
这事你得相信我的直觉
You need to trust my instincts on this one.

374
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,460
-好  -谢谢  马克
- Okay. - Thank you, Mark.

375
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,510
谢谢
Thank you.

376
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,410
你可能并不总同意他  但你喜欢他
You may not always agree with him, but you like him.

377
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,650
我喜欢他清醒的头脑
I like his clarity.

378
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,260
别忘了  他的候选人输了
Let's just not forget, his candidate lost.

379
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,370
而现在他为你工作
And now he works for you.

380
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,300
不  我觉得他其实在为你工作  不是吗
No, I think he's really working for you, isn't he?

381
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,810
别疑神疑鬼  弗兰西斯
Don't get paranoid, Francis.

382
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,550
现在不  更待何时
If not now, when?

383
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,590
你得走了
You have to go.

384
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,130
什么
I what?

385
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,540
你得离开
You need to leave.

386
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,270
发生什么了
What's happened?

387
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,710
这里就是容不下你了
There's just no place for you here anymore.

388
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,400
你考虑过了吗
Have you been thinking about this?

389
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,280
是的
Yes.

390
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,050
我不同意
I don't agree.

391
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,350
我说得很明白了
I'm completely clear about it.

392
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,050
你可以喝完你的咖啡
You can finish your coffee.

393
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,110
你怎么做到的
How do you do that?

394
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,250
就那样关闭感情
Just... turn off like that?

395
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,770
走吧  汤姆
Please go, Tom.

396
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,290
走
Go.

397
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,480
好吧
Okay.

398
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,440
如果这是你的选择
If that's what you choose.

399
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,970
也来点
Join us?

400
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,850
算了  我不想把新肝也喝坏
No, I'm trying not to wear out the new model.

401
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,780
什么事你们大驾光临
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

402
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,100
我就直说了  弗兰克
Well, I'll get right to it, Frank.

403
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,660
众议院的共和党人终于有一次
Well, for once, the House Republicans...

404
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,430
能完成工作了
are getting something done.

405
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,680
坏消息是  那就是弹劾你
And the bad news is, is that thing is impeaching you.

406
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,970
我觉得司法委员会
Oh, I think the judiciary

407
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,850
离做出决定还差得远呢
is a long way from making any sort of decision.

408
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,070
我得知  他们接下来几天里就会把
They're sending articles of impeachment to the House

409
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,110
弹劾状送交众议院
in the next few days, I'm told.

410
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,060
而今早的新闻更是火上浇油
And that news this morning is just adding fuel to the fire.

411
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,680
天呐
Jesus Christ.

412
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,770
我是来问你是否...
And I'm here to ask if you...

413
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,860
你是否能考虑辞职
Would you consider resigning

414
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,930
而不是把这事扯到参议院去
instead of dragging this through the Senate?

415
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,910
你们俩疯了吗
Have the two of you lost your minds?

416
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,750
你  泰瑞  你自己也在受调查
And you, Terry, you're under investigation yourself

417
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,170
你还敢跑来跟我说这话
and you dare come here and ask me this?

418
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,890
我经常恨你恨得牙根痒
I've often hated your guts,

419
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,940
但我承认  我会怀念你的
but I have to admit, I'll miss you.

420
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,670
鲍勃  别忘了
Oh, Bob, in case you've forgotten,

421
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,130
参议院是民主党的
the Senate is Democratic.

422
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,740
-我短时间内不会走人的  -不是你
- I won't be leaving anytime soon. - Oh, not you.

423
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,560
是我  我已经干不动了
Me. I'm getting too old for this.

424
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,560
什么
What?

425
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,410
众议院离了鲍勃·博奇不得面目全非了
A House without Bob Birch? It will be unrecognizable.

426
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,490
我觉得已经是这样了  天呐
I feel like it already is. God...

427
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,900
一直都是这么肮脏的吗
Was it always this dirty?

428
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,320
那不可能
That's impossible.

429
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,230
我们的先辈就要更干净些吗
Were the men before us any more moral?

430
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,660
更配得上他们所处的位置
Any more worthy of the power and position

431
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,750
和所拥有的权力吗
that they had found themselves in?

432
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,650
更有能力为公众牟利吗
Any more capable of doing a single goddamn thing for the public?

433
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,260
也是  也不是
Well, yes and no.

434
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,720
历史总是看上去比实际上要好
History has a way of looking better than it was.

435
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,090
或许莎士比亚是对的
Or perhaps Shakespeare was right.

436
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,230
我们都是疯子给瞎子带路
We're all just madmen leading the blind.

437
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,650
李女士  我是白宫的赛斯·格雷森
Ms. Lee. This is Seth Grayson, from the White House.

438
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,010
谢谢你接我的电话
Yeah, thank you for taking my call.

439
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,340
我就是有个问题
I just had a question.

440
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,380
有个记者
There, uh... there was a reporter.

441
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,760
等一下  我查查我的笔记
Give me a second. Let me just check my notes.

442
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,700
叫肖恩·杰弗瑞斯
Name's Sean Jeffries.

443
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,870
对  他在做一篇捐赠名单的报道
Yeah, he's working on a story about the donor list,

444
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,350
就是总统接受移植期间的事
around the time of the president's transplant.

445
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,740
不知你能不能来一趟
I was wondering if you could come in

446
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,200
我们好协调一下回应
and we can coordinate our response.

447
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,150
李女士  我们不希望大家认为
Ms. Lee, we don't want people to think

448
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,110
总统得到了特殊待遇
that the president got preferential treatment.

449
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,410
天呐
Jesus.

450
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,790
你给了我什么啊  麦卡
What the hell did you give me, Mac?

451
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,120
天啊
Jesus.

452
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,640
你给了我什么啊  麦卡
What the hell did you give me, Mac?

453
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,310
我有关于头条网爆料来源的消息
I had a tip on where that Slugline story came from.

454
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,240
你该打给我的
You should have called me.

455
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,150
那也阻止不了什么
That wouldn't have stopped it.

456
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,070
-你是为这事而来吗  -不  我有别的消息
- Is that why you're here? - No, I got something else.

457
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,070
说吧
Tell me.

458
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,260
我想跟副总统聊聊
I'd like to talk to the vice president about it.

459
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,720
那不可能
That's not possible.

460
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,200
一切都要经过我
Everything goes through me.

461
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,300
我之前没机会解释清楚
Well, I didn't have a chance to explain myself.

462
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,870
太可惜了
That's too bad.

463
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,650
她什么样
What's she like?

464
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,780
她不忍受愚蠢  也不给人第二次机会
She doesn't suffer fools and she doesn't give second chances.

465
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,830
如果你不能让我再跟她见面
Well, if you can't get me in to talk to her again,

466
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,780
我会另想办法
I'll find some other way.

467
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,220
你冲昏头了
You're in over your head.

468
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,570
要么告诉我你知道什么  要么滚蛋
Tell me what you know or move along.

469
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,900
不
No.

470
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,000
我们没有  汉默施密特先生
We don't, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

471
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,110
不管你掌握了什么信息
Whatever information you have...

472
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,660
别再打给我了
Don't call me again.

473
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,370
我还担心我那天晚上说错话了
I was concerned I was out of line the other night.

474
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,930
或许吧
You might have been.

475
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,780
对不起  我有时候口不择言
I'm sorry. I don't even know what I'm saying sometimes.

476
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,830
算了
Forget it.

477
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,890
等一下
Hey, hang on a second.

478
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,710
我需要告诉你我的想法
I need to tell you how I'm feeling.

479
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,160
国家需要你  总统先生
The nation needs you, Mr. President.

480
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,640
-我们都需要你  -今天就到这儿吧
- We all need you. - We're done for today.

481
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,650
-不  -不
- No. - No?

482
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,560
不  你为什么不愿听我想说的话
No. Why don't you want to hear what I'm trying to tell you?

483
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,750
听着  你...够了
Listen. You... enough.

484
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,160
我爱你  你得知道
I love you. You need to know that.

485
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,720
-我只是想保护你  -你得冷静下来
- I'm only here to protect you. - You need to calm down.

486
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,070
你是怎么了  你为什么不愿听
What's wrong with you? Why don't you wanna hear

487
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,770
-我想说的话  -我没怎么
- what I'm telling you? - There is nothing wrong with me.

488
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,490
但你得回家了
But you need to go home.

489
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,470
是你找我的  是你叫我来的
You reached out to me. You brought me in. I...

490
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,370
够了
Enough.

491
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,460
-对不起  -他不在
- I'm sorry. - He's out.

492
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,620
我回头再来
I'll come back later.

493
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,460
不管是什么  我可以转交给他
Whatever it is, I can give it to him.

494
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,730
你可以托给我转交的  道格
You can trust me to hand it over, Doug.

495
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,770
-没叫你跟踪汤姆·耶茨啊  -有的
- You weren't directed to follow Tom Yates. - Yes, I was.

496
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,110
总统说要监视每个人
According to the president, everyone needs to be watched.

497
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,240
汤姆都不在这里了
Tom's not even here anymore.

498
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,780
弗兰西斯叫你跟踪他的吗
Francis asked you to follow him?

499
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,160
我担心一个人
I'm concerned about someone.

500
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,920
劳拉·莫雷蒂
Laura Moretti.

501
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,710
我知道她  和她丈夫的事
I know about her... and her husband.

502
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,760
你的行为是判断不佳的表现  道格
Your behavior shows poor judgment, Doug,

503
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,180
而且可能连累总统
and could be a liability for the president.

504
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,900
是  女士
Yes, ma'am.

505
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,290
等弗兰西斯回来把这给他
Give these to Francis when he gets back.

506
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,200
我可以给你拿到豁免权
I can get you immunity.

507
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,960
你只需要讲出真话
You just need to tell the truth.

508
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,250
确认沃克的证词都是真的
Confirm that all of Walker's testimony is true.

509
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,780
你不需要这么做
You don't have to do it.

510
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,740
不  莫琳  我要公开说
No, Maureen, I want this on the record.

511
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,460
你怎么能这么背叛安德伍德夫妇
How dare you betray the Underwoods like this?

512
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,190
我们说完了  议员
We're done here, Congressman.

513
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,280
谢谢你抽时间
Well, thank you for your time.

514
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,800
请你准备好
So you're prepared,

515
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,860
司法委员会很快会签发传票
a subpoena will be coming soon from the Judiciary Committee.

516
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,210
国务卿女士
Madam Secretary.

517
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,160
你想进去吗
Do you wanna come in?

518
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,460
是我导致了你丈夫的死
I'm the reason your husband's dead.

519
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,090
我逼迫卫生和人类服务部部长
I forced the Secretary of Health and Human Services...

520
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
把弗兰西斯·安德伍德插在捐赠名单上他之前
to put Francis Underwood in front of him on the donor list.

521
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,540
如果你觉得我是禽兽我也能理解
I understand if you think I'm a monster.

522
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
但我不后悔
But I'd do it again.

523
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,140
为了救总统  我愿不惜一切
To save the president, I'd do anything.

524
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,960
你真觉得我不知道吗  道格
You really think that I didn't know, Doug?

525
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,700
是时机暴露了
The timing gave it away.

526
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,660
来吧  快进屋
Come on. Come on in.

527
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,040
你以为是怎么回事
What did you think was going on here?

528
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,860
我操你不是因为我喜欢你
I'm not fucking you because I like you.

529
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,850
我操你是因为我恨你
I'm fucking you because I hate you.

530
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,190
出去
Get out.

531
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,280
滚出我的车
Get out of my car.

532
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,300
快滚出我的车
Get the fuck out of my car.

533
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,450
滚
Get out!

534
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,420
麦卡伦给了你什么
What did Macallan give you?

535
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,570
-我不知道你在说什么  -我听见你说话了
- I don't know what you're talking about. - I heard you.

536
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,410
他给了你什么东西
You got something from him.

537
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,720
什么叫"你听见我说话了"
What do you mean you heard me?

538
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,540
你还在监视我吗
Were you watching me, too?

539
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,970
他是你什么人
Who was he to you?

540
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,170
喝一杯吗
Want a drink?

541
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,050
我不喝酒
I don't drink.

542
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
对了
Oh, right.

543
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,750
我和他睡过
I was with him.

544
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,250
我还年轻  不该跟他睡的时候
When I was young and shouldn't have been with him.

545
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,460
你喜欢什么  道格
What gets you off, Doug?

546
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,430
有吗
Anything?

547
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,170
要是麦卡伦给了你什么  我们应该上交
If Macallan gave you something, we should hand it over.

548
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,170
你喜欢吗
Did you like it?

549
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,380
什么
What?

550
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,900
监视我
Watching me.

551
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,100
喜欢
Yes.

552
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,970
你喜欢你看见的吗
You liked what you saw?

553
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,410
这是你来找我的原因吗
That why you came here?

554
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,890
那好吧
Well, then.

555
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,190
我要去健身房  跑步消解压力
Going to the gym. Run off some of this stress.

556
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,120
你的教练呢
Where's your trainer?

557
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,950
他有一段时间都不会来了
Oh, he won't be coming around for a while.

558
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,620
他有个表情我可不会怀念
He did have a facial expression I won't miss.

559
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,250
是吗
Is that so?

560
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,530
那种凝固的笑  很瘆人
Sort of perma-smile. It was creepy.

561
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,270
也许他只是开心罢了
Maybe he's just happy.

562
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,580
我不担心开心
Happiness isn't my concern.

563
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,790
现在不  从来都不
Not now, not ever.

564
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,300
这局面太不幸了  克莱尔
It's a tragic situation, Claire.

565
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,790
-我知道  -我可以给你看看正在发生的事
- I know. - I could show you what's happening.

566
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,270
我看过照片了
I've seen the images.

567
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,020
务必要让民众知道霍姆斯城正在发生什么
It's important people know what's going on in Homs.

568
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,820
你改主意了吗
Are you having second thoughts?

569
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,180
只是现在时机还不到
It's just the timing isn't right yet.

570
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,610
因为你丈夫得不到支持
Because your husband doesn't have the support.

571
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,980
我们得有理有据
We need to make a case.

572
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,240
你做声明之前  让全世界做好准备
Prepare the world for when you make a statement.

573
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,900
我认为弗兰西斯得来做主导
I think Francis needs to be front and center on this.

574
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,330
你没查到麦卡伦告诉佩特罗夫什么了
You never found out what Macallan told Petrov?

575
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,290
我的线人说  他没说什么真正有用的
My sources say he never gave him anything concrete.

576
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,390
-他给了莉安一些东西  -我们希望如此
- Well, he gave LeAnn something. - Well, that was our hope.

577
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,520
也许是时候再把她请回来了
Maybe it's time to invite her back in.

578
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,070
也许吧  我得上楼了
Maybe. I need to get back upstairs.

579
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,530
下次在我办公室见
The next time we meet will be in my office.

580
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,440
我不觉得你丈夫该做主导
I... I don't think your husband should be front and center.

581
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,830
应该是你
I think it should be you.

582
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,700
我没问你的意见
I didn't ask you what you think.

583
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,470
你得有所准备  克莱尔
You need to be armed, Claire.

584
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,890
无论他怎样
It's important that you can walk away

585
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,140
你务必得能全身而退
from anything that happens to him.

586
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,420
去他们的
They can kiss my ass.

587
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,910
参议员韦斯特维尔特有意要我
I got an offer from Senator Westervelt.

588
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,690
我也在找
I'm looking, too.

589
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,320
但想下这艘船越来越困难了
But it's getting harder and harder to get off this ship.

590
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,890
我妻子在哪
Where is my wife?

591
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,460
她去哪了
Where has she gone?

592
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,790
如果她是你妻子  你不会想知道吗
If she was your wife, wouldn't you wonder?

593
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,240
好  安德伍德夫人
Yes, Mrs. Underwood.

594
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,210
别担心  这事没发生过
Don't worry. This never happened.

595
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,900
不用你告诉我
You don't have to tell me.

596
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,680
-道格  -该死
- Doug. - Shit.

597
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,760
我该过去吗
Should I come in?

598
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,930
不  除非你把你手里的东西给我
No. Not until you give me what you've got.

599
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,380
总统先生
Mr. President.

600
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,180
"一位白宫内部人士透露
"A source deep within the White House...

601
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,630
安德伍德总统确实
confirms President Underwood

602
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,360
曾利用可疑情报
used questionable intelligence

603
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,030
为关闭投票中心找理由
to justify voting center closures,

604
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,190
从而使选举陷入了混乱"
which threw the election into chaos."

605
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,020
你觉得会是谁
Who do you think it is?

606
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,990
可能是格林
Green, probably.

607
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,720
-我们高估了他的忠诚  -我明白了
- We overestimated his loyalty. - I see.

608
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,940
要不
I mean...

609
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,020
还能是谁
who else could it be?

610
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,470
我能做些什么
How can I help?

611
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,200
我们得自救
We need to save ourselves here.

612
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,870
-这事对我俩都很不利  凯茜  -我明白
- It's as much your head as mine, Cathy. - I understand.

613
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,910
我需要你编写额外的材料
I need you to create additional documents

614
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,870
为追捕卡拉比找理由
that justify going after Kalabi.

615
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,440
制造书面痕迹来支撑我们
A paper trail that will support our actions

616
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,210
选举日在田纳西采取的行动
that we took on Election Day in Tennessee.

617
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,150
我不确定
I'm not sure...

618
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,180
该是什么样的材料
what those documents would be.

619
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,880
可你够聪明  对吧  凯茜
Well, but you're smart, Cathy, aren't you?

620
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,040
你会想到的
I mean, you can figure it out.

621
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,680
让我看看你有多聪明吧
Why don't you just show me how smart you are.

622
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:50,430
-当然  总统先生  -还有在联合国的演讲
- Of course, Mr. President. - And the presentation at the UN.

623
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,770
-关于叙利亚的  -必须进行
- With Syria? - It needs to happen.

624
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,940
-好吧  -可能会引起非议
- Very well. - There's a possibility of talks,

625
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,200
但我们得让所有相关方重新回到谈判桌上
but we need to get all the interested parties back to the table.

626
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,340
当然
Of course.

627
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,880
你是个好外交官  凯茜
You're a good diplomat, Cathy.

628
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,400
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

629
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,770
另外  克莱尔呢
And where is Claire?

630
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,990
她现在需要保持些距离
She needed a little distance right now.

631
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,780
直到我们看清我到底怎么回事
Till we find out what's happening with me.

632
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,450
所以我现在必须指望你了  凯茜
That's why I need to rely on you, Cathy. Now.

633
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,870
很高兴你这么想  弗兰西斯
Well, I'm glad you feel that way, Francis.

634
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,380
是我  我可以见面了
Yes. I'm ready to meet.

635
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,370
我现在就要见面  马上
I wanna meet now. Right now.

636
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,010
在一次
After a tumultuous election,

637
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,700
前所未有的混乱选举后
the likes of which have never been seen,

638
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,590
美国面临着更多的问题
America faces more questions...

639
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,140
我现在一堆破事  没时间应付你
Shit is insane right now. I don't have any more time for you.

640
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,170
如果最近从白宫泄露出来的情报
If the recent leaks coming out of the White House

641
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,350
得到证实  总统将面临...
prove to be true, the president could face...

642
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,060
白宫身份牌  你从哪弄的
A White House ID? Where did you get that?

643
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,500
我还以为是你给的
I thought this came from you.

644
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,670
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

645
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,810
-我现在是副新闻发言人了  -去你妈的
- I'm deputy press secretary. - The fuck you are.

646
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,330
我接到了副总统办公室的电话
I got a call from the vice president's office,

647
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,600
让我过来
asking me to come in.

648
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,060
我到的时候  这个已经准备好了
And when I got here, this was waiting for me.

649
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,060
我刚才一小时都在办手续
I just spent the last hour doing my paperwork.

650
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,180
我没时间跟你胡扯
I don't have time for this.

651
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,360
加勒特·沃克总统的爆炸性证词
President Garrett Walker's bombshell testimony, which...

652
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,720
我有国务卿杜兰特的辞职信
I have Secretary Durant's resignation.

653
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,520
我相信她就是泄密者
I believe she was the leak,

654
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,080
并且可能要为
and might have to take responsibility

655
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,010
选举当晚发生的事负责
for whatever happened on election night.

656
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,910
先生  司法委员会现在随时
Sir, the judiciary could issue a resolution

657
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,670
会发出弹劾决议了
for impeachment any day now.

658
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,570
我们得现实地面对这事对总统的伤害
We need to be realistic about damage to the president

659
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,050
即便参议院不定罪
even if the Senate doesn't convict.

660
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,470
你承诺的是党内警告
You promised us censure.

661
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,380
杜兰特的泄密已经起到同样的效果了  不是吗
Well, Durant's leak took care of that, didn't it?

662
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,620
我们有个应对参议院的计划
So, we have a plan for the Senate.

663
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,090
我建议重点保护副总统
I suggest we work on protecting the vice president.

664
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,990
确保她在整个过程中能全身而退
Make sure she exits this whole process unscathed.

665
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,510
我们要怎么才能做到
And how do we do that?

666
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,730
声称不知情  副总统没审阅任何相关信息
Plead ignorance. The vice president wasn't read into anything.

667
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,190
什么也不知道
Didn't know anything.

668
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,500
-也什么都没做  -不行的
- Didn't do anything. - That won't play.

669
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,110
她会看上去不知情  但人们知道并非如此
She'll look uninformed, and the people know she isn't.

670
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,420
距离会让她看起来无辜
Oh, the distance will help her look innocent.

671
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,570
无辜或有罪  有能力或没用  不管怎样
Innocent, guilty, capable, incompetent, whatever it is...

672
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,550
公众都会往反方向想
the public is going to think the opposite.

673
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,650
所以真是怎么都输
So, really there is no winning.

674
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,570
照你的意思来吧
Whatever you think is best.

675
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,030
如果我被判无罪  你会有四年时间
You're gonna have four years to prove yourself

676
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,280
在位子上证明自己  希望是八年
on the inside if I'm acquitted. Hopefully, eight.

677
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,180
但如果我被判有罪呢
But what happens if I'm not acquitted?

678
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,240
我们现在不用考虑那个
We don't have to deal with that right now.

679
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,350
不  我想听到一个计划
No, I want to hear a plan.

680
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,130
这正是找你来的原因
That's why you're here.

681
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,600
给我冷冰冰  硬梆梆的事实
To give me the cold, hard facts.

682
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,400
我的盘算不比您高明  总统先生
Oh, your calculus is as good as mine, Mr. President.

683
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,450
根本没有计划
There is no plan.

684
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,580
只能拖住司法委员会  稳住参议院
Except slow down judiciary, secure the Senate.

685
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,640
我担心一个人
I'm concerned about someone.

686
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,360
劳拉·莫雷蒂
Laura Moretti.

687
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:28,430
为什么把这个也放进来
Why did you include this?

688
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,180
你跟克莱尔谈这个什么劳拉·莫雷蒂
You and Claire talking about a Laura Moretti?

689
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,720
我想让你知道  先生  她知道了
I wanted you to know, sir, that she knows.

690
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,010
我在名单上帮你插了队
I jumped you on the list.

691
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,240
好获得肝脏捐赠
To receive a donor liver.

692
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,180
我强迫卫生和人类服务部部长调高了你的排名
I forced the HHS Secretary to move you up.

693
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,020
-那不可能  -我威胁了她  先生
- That's not possible. - I threatened her, sir.

694
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,720
这是前所未有的道德违规  但我不后悔这样做
It was an unprecedented ethical violation. But I don't regret it.

695
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,100
我独守这个秘密  好让你...
I kept it to myself, so that you would...

696
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:59,880
在有人发现时可以合理推诿
have plausible deniability if anyone found out.

697
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,860
我也没告诉安德伍德夫人
I didn't tell Mrs. Underwood either.

698
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,120
她是从别处知道的
She learned another way.

699
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,480
她知道却没告诉我
She knew and didn't tell me.

700
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,310
看起来是这样
Seems so.

701
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,520
她对耶茨的监控反应如何
And how did she react to the Yates surveillance?

702
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,000
那个她怎么说的
What did she say about that?

703
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,760
她没对我表达她的感受  先生
She didn't show her feelings to me, sir.

704
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,430
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

705
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,360
我与你同在  先生
I'm here for you, sir.

706
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,100
直到永远
Always.

707
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,530
你对安德伍德夫人有疑虑吗
Do you have concerns about Mrs. Underwood?

708
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,370
-你有吗  -我永远不会这样讲
- Do you? - I would never say that.

709
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,860
我要给你看点东西
I want to show you something.

710
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:56,010
有45分钟我不清楚她的行踪
There's 45 minutes where I can't account for her whereabouts.

711
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,570
我不知道她去了哪里  见了什么人
I don't know where she went or who she saw.

712
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,290
但是她对我说谎了
But she lied to me.

713
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,080
我认为你应该休息一下  先生
I, uh... I think you should get some rest, sir.

714
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:35,730
总统没有让我审阅
The president didn't read me in.

715
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,770
我不在房间里
I wasn't in the room.

716
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,750
总统没有让我审阅
The president didn't read me in.

717
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,120
我不在房间里
I wasn't in the room.

718
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,310
我对此毫不知情
I didn't know anything about it.

719
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,840
总统没有让我审阅
The president didn't read me in.

720
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,990
我不在房间里
I wasn't in the room.

721
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,960
我对此毫不知情
I didn't know anything about it.

722
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,040
怎么样  弗兰西斯
How's that, Francis?

723
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,830
最新消息  国务卿凯瑟琳·杜兰特
This is just in. Secretary of State Catherine Durant

724
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,760
将在众议院司法委员会作证
to appear in front of the House Judiciary Committee.

725
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,770
这个意外令已经非常戏剧化的...
This comes as yet another surprise in the already dramatic...

726
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,720
-什么时候收到的  -不久之前
- When did it come in? - A short while ago.

727
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,410
不是凯茜·杜兰特
It's not Cathy Durant.

728
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,410
我们能确定吗
Are we sure?

729
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,110
她争取了豁免权
She negotiated immunity.

730
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,870
她作证时
And she's going on record

731
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,110
将公开她知道的一切
with everything she knows when she testifies.

732
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,270
我们知道是谁吗
Do we have any idea?

733
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,040
不知道
No.

734
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,340
好
Good.

735
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,910
谢谢
Thanks.

737
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:51,420
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}特朗普上任后一直麻烦不断  不仅一系列政策遭到媒体的广泛批评
还有多个国会委员会在对俄罗斯干扰2016大选进行调查
在前联调局局长科米被突然撤职后  媒体普遍认为特朗普干预司法
许多媒体开始讨论是否应该弹劾他  但也有冷静的声音指出
目前特朗普所属的共和党在参众两院都占多数  弹劾基本无可能

739
00:49:51,420 --> 00:50:41,420
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}当年比尔·克林顿因为在莱温斯基事件上公然说谎  国会启动弹劾程序
众议院投票表决同意弹劾后  弹劾的决议在参议院没有获得足够票数
在参众两院的两次投票中  克林顿所属的民主党党员大都坚定地站在总统这边
目前批评特朗普的声浪虽高  但都是来自民主党
而即便在特朗普的一些言行明显离谱  甚至有违法嫌疑的情况下
国会共和党也不敢对他有太多微辞  所以媒体才认为目前弹劾可能性很小
可以看出  涉及到弹劾时  美国两党议员
基本都是根据自己的党派归属来决定立场的
