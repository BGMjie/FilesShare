24
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,820
人民很愤怒
The people are angry.

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,580
九周前  我们国家举行了一场大选
Nine weeks ago, we had an election in this country,

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,600
但是由于两个州拒绝认证选举结果
but because two states refused to certify,

27
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,700
康威和我都没拿到270张选举人票
neither Conway nor myself received the 270 electoral votes

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,460
而这是胜选的必要条件
required for victory.

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,710
所以他们每天早上聚集在这里
So they gather here every morning

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,410
来履行他们神圣的权利
to exercise their magnificent right,

31
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,920
被第一修正案保障的权利
guaranteed by the First Amendment...

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,290
发出他们愤怒的声音
to let their angry voices be heard.

33
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,900
就这样  感恩节  圣诞节
And so, Thanksgiving, Christmas,

34
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,210
再加上半个一月来了又去
and half of January have come and gone,

35
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,290
政府的三大分支全都深陷危机
and all three branches of government are in crisis.

36
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,230
国会吵成一团
The Congress is in disarray,

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,080
最高法院少了一位法官  必将陷入僵局
the Supreme Court is down a justice and doomed to deadlock,

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,430
而行政机关也群龙无首
and the executive branch is without a boss.

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,540
你看  我觉得
You see, my feeling is,

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,480
国父们就是乏了
I think the Founding Fathers, they just got tired.

41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,900
说真的  谁能怪他们呢
And really, can you blame them?

42
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,820
你怎么可能把方方面面都考虑周全
I mean, you can't think of everything.

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,790
各种意外  各种难以避免的灾难
Black swans, Murphy's Law.

44
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,470
到了一定程度
I mean, at a certain point,

45
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,600
你也只能放弃  交叉手指
you just have to sign off and cross your goddamn fingers

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,210
祈求能有个好结果
and hope for the best.

47
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,000
或者使用"扔硬币原理"
Or adopt "flipism,"

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,660
这是一种伪哲学  意思是
a pseudo-philosophy of life in which

49
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,830
生活中最重要的事都要通过扔硬币来决定
the most important decisions are made by the flipping of a coin.

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,380
这个说法最先出现在迪士尼的漫画书
It was first introduced in the Disney comic book

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,450
《硬币决定法》里  我最喜欢这期了
Flip Decision, one of my favorites,

52
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,680
里面讲到巴蒂教授说服唐老鸭
in which Donald Duck is persuaded by Professor Batty

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,730
所有重大的人生决定
to make all the most important decisions

54
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,680
都通过扔硬币来决断
based on the flipping of a coin.

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,610
"生活就是场赌博
"Life is but a gamble.

56
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,500
让扔硬币原理指引你"
Let flipism guide your ramble."

57
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,320
我们以前也有过这种麻烦
We've had this sort of trouble before.

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,810
1800年大选  杰斐逊对伯尔
The election of 1800, Jefferson versus Burr.

59
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,710
他们最后打成了平手  每人73张选举人票
They wound up in a tie. 73 electoral votes each.

60
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,130
那是当时的胜选票数
That was the number required then,

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,590
这时国会试图解决这种
and that's when Congress tried to address

62
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,510
国父们根本想象不到的局面
what the Founding Fathers just couldn't imagine.

63
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,980
于是  第十二修正案诞生了
And, poof, the Twelfth Amendment was born.

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,020
里面说  如果各州不能认证选举结果
And it says that if the states don't certify,

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,300
那么就由众议院来挑选总统
it's the House that chooses the president

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,410
由参议院来选副总统
and the Senate that chooses the vice president.

67
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,750
众议院有点乱  说不清楚
Now the House is a bit of a mess,

68
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,740
但是参议院选副总统的办法可是挺民主的
but the Senate is rather democratic in how they choose the VP.

69
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,620
一人一票
One person, one vote.

70
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,290
但如果还是平局
But if there's a tie...

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,590
就该唐老鸭登场了
and this is where Donald Duck comes in,

72
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,120
选举的结果
it's resolved...

73
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,560
全看这硬币一扔
by the toss of a coin.

74
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,570
这办法简洁得见了鬼
A solution that's elegant as hell.

75
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,550
不过现代政治哪有什么简洁可言
But then there's no elegance in modern politics.

76
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,170
只剩下见鬼了
It's mostly hell.

77
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,220
美国总统的宝座花落谁家
The identity of the next President of these United States

78
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,580
决定权再次落到了这一帮
is once again in the hands of a bunch of

79
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,620
自私自利  嗜财如命
self-serving, money-hungry,

80
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,280
阿谀谄媚  贪恋权势的政治家手里
boot-licking, power-seeking politicians

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,750
而加以利诱  或者迎头痛击
who can be seduced or sucker punched

82
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,810
或者要挟就能让他们服从
or blackmailed into submission.

83
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,180
我只需要比另一个人多一票就行
And all I need is just one more vote than the other guy.

84
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,140
如你所见  国父们根本没想到会有这种局面
As you can see, the Founding Fathers didn't plan for this.

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,030
而我想到了
But I did.

86
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,180
我就是你的新爹
Meet your new daddy.

87
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,460
好
Right.

88
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,940
你能感觉到  对吧  简直身临其境
You can feel it, right? It's like you're there.

89
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,300
是不是跟真的一样
Doesn't that look just like it?

90
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,980
在我看来简直就是那个地方
To me, it is that place.

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
你还好吧
You okay, man?

92
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,350
好  当然好了
Yeah. Of course.

93
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,170
真的有帮助  很管用的
It really helps. Very effective.

94
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,330
是啊  我很乐意帮你拉更多投资来
Yeah. I'd be happy to help you find more funding for it.

95
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,740
如果你情绪有点激动的话
If you're feeling a little worked up...

96
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,880
什么
What?

97
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,980
情绪激动
Little worked up?

98
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,050
两个多月以前我就当选成为美国总统了
I was elected President of the United States over two months ago.

99
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,680
但不知为何  现在国会将决定选举结果
But somehow, Congress is now deciding the election.

100
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
所以原谅我有些
So forgive me for being a little...

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
-威尔  -情绪激动
- Will... - ...worked up.

102
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,180
东尼应该不是话中有话
I don't think Tony was implying anything.

103
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,910
当然  那好
Of course. Good.

104
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,490
我去准备一下
I'm gonna get myself ready.

105
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,710
我可不想这副样子去参加活动
I don't want to go to the event looking like this.

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,810
是啊
Right.

107
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,880
谢谢  东尼
Thanks, Tony.

108
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,830
罗梅洛的幕僚长坚称他不在这儿
Romero's chief of staff insists he's not in town.

109
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,650
-你相信她吗  -不
- And do you believe her? - No.

110
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,910
但她在特区待得比他久
But she's been in D.C. longer than he has.

111
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,620
她总会顾及自己的
At some point she'll take care of herself.

112
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,430
你告没告诉她  我不想跟他谈
Well, did you tell her I have no interest in discussing

113
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,610
宣战委员会的事
the Declaration of War Committee with him?

114
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
我表明了
I expressed our desire

115
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,010
我们想跟议员进行一次客气而有成效的谈话
for a civil and productive meeting with the Congressman.

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,690
找到他
Well, find him.

117
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,600
要是他想躲着我
If he wants to hide from me,

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,980
那就当着我的面做
he can do it to my face.

119
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,930
是  先生
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,750
还有  道格
And, Doug.

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,320
今天外面有多少抗议者
How many protestors are out there today?

122
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,230
比昨天多
More than yesterday.

123
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,220
但他们已经尽力
But they're doing their best

124
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,120
让他们远离白宫了
to divert them away from the White House.

125
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,170
我不知道哪样更糟
I don't know what's worse...

126
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,220
是他们抗议喊口号的声音
the sound of their chanting

127
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,130
还是他们不喊时的寂静
or the sound of silence when they're not.

128
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,250
我去工作了  先生
I'll get to work, sir.

129
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,910
早上好  奥古斯都
Good morning, Augustus.

130
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,900
艾瑞克  我...
Well, Eric, I...

131
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,940
抱歉  他们让我坐着  但
I'm sorry. They told me to sit, but, uh--

132
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,330
没事  完全没关系  我
No, no, no. It's perfectly fine. I...

133
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,830
我想不到还有谁
I can't imagine anyone else who would...

134
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,490
会比你更喜欢这个
well, enjoy this more than you.

135
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,270
我们在斯波特瑟尔韦尼亚相遇后
You know, I only started it

136
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,880
我才开始做的这个
after you and I met in Spotsylvania.

137
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,210
你对细节的注重简直是
The attention to detail is... It's just...

138
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,810
没错
It is, yes.

139
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,730
我有
I've got...

140
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,850
我
I mean, I...

141
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,690
抱歉  我现在有点不知所错
I'm sorry, I'm a... a little overwhelmed by the moment.

142
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,460
就是
It's just...

143
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,740
我有一种感觉  就好像
I have this feeling, as if, uh...

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
我曾经想象过这个场景
I've imagined this somehow.

145
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,430
我知道这听起来
I know that sounds, uh...

146
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,090
你连他背包上的扣子都做出来了
You've even got the button on his haversack.

147
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,350
是啊
Yes.

148
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,630
我觉得人们会低估
I think people underestimate...

149
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,380
注重细节
the importance of detail...

150
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,170
对整体感觉的影响
to the overall impact.

151
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,280
是啊
Yeah.

152
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,720
血腥角专家肯定会非常钦佩的
The Bloody Angle experts would be very impressed.

153
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,820
我们在斯波特瑟尔韦尼亚相遇时  你怎么知道
When we met in Spotsylvania, how did you know...

154
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,280
那么多关于奥古斯都的细节
so many specific things about Augustus, uh...

155
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,190
关于奥古斯都·安德伍德之死
about Augustus Underwood's death?

156
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,000
知道他牺牲的确切地点
I mean, the very spot where he died?

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,960
知道他的脑袋被石头砸扁了
The... the fact that his skull had been crushed with a rock?

158
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,440
知道他们把他葬在无名冢里
That they buried him in an unmarked grave? I mean...

159
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,430
这么多细节
the detail of all that.

160
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,710
希望你能原谅我
Hope you'll forgive me, uh...

161
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,420
原谅什么
For?

162
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,850
我那天见到了副总统弗兰西斯·安德伍德
I was meeting Vice President Francis Underwood.

163
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,360
我觉得应该给他讲个精彩的传说
I... thought he deserved a good story.

164
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,770
慢着  等等
Wait, wait a minute. You...

165
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,530
-那些全是你编的  -那个
- you made all that up? - Well...

166
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,570
我自由发挥了一下
I took some liberties.

167
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,740
但  我也说不好  我一开了头
But, well, I don't know, once it started,

168
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,720
就能清晰地看见了
it came to me so clearly...

169
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,620
-艾瑞克  对吗  -对  先生
- It's Eric, yeah? - Yes, sir.

170
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,770
抗议人群吗
The crowd?

171
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,980
对  抱歉  你刚才要说什么
Yes. I'm sorry, what were you about to say?

172
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,630
我无意唐突  先生
I don't mean to overstep, sir...

173
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,900
但外面的人
but the people out there...

174
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,550
我不在乎他们说什么
I don't care what they're saying.

175
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,130
在我看来  人的命运
And the way I see it, a person's destiny is, you know...

176
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,960
是注定的
sealed.

177
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,130
我们踏入了未知领域
We are in uncharted territory here.

178
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,680
好  但是唐尼  帮个忙好吗
All right. But, Donny, do me a favor, okay?

179
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,310
-让宪法  -我能说完吗
- Let the Constitution-- - Can I finish?

180
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,490
等等  让宪法行使它的职责
Hold on. Just let the Constitution do its job.

181
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,390
好吧  乔  让我说完一次
Okay, Joe, Joe, I'm gonna finish for once.

182
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,070
现在有选民提起个诉
You've got voters filing individual suits...

183
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,190
-对  -田纳西和俄亥俄都有
- Right. - ...in Tennessee and Ohio,

184
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,650
都堆在最高法院了
and they are jammed up in the Supreme Court.

185
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,900
就像别的一切
Like everything else,

186
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,630
这个国家的日常事务被中断了
the day-to-day workings of this country are on hold.

187
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,180
好  或许是被中断了  但你猜怎么
Okay, they may be on hold, but guess what?

188
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,430
据我所知
Last time I checked,

189
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,950
大家仍然在领社保支票
everybody was still getting their Social Security checks.

190
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,330
没错  但如果达到债务上限了呢
Yeah, but if the debt limit is reached?

191
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,210
拜托  让我说完
Come on. Let me finish now.

192
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,570
再说一遍  这就是为什么我们有宪法
Again, it's why we have a Constitution.

193
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,310
我知道看上去很混乱
I know it looks messy.

194
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,200
民主就很混乱  但你猜怎么
Democracy's messy. But guess what?

195
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,230
这种乱局是有规律的
There is a method to that madness.

196
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,820
我说不好  乔
I don't know, Joe.

197
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,750
如今是混乱胜过规律
It's more madness than method right now.

198
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,040
如果政府停摆
I mean, if the government does shut down,

199
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,240
那些社保支票或许就要停发
those Social Security checks, they might not go out.

200
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,370
如果政府停摆
If the government shuts down,

201
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,950
谁知道国会还能不能选出总统
who knows if Congress can even pick a president?

202
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,190
众议院的每个州只有一票
Each state in the House just gets one vote.

203
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,090
那么如果特拉华州和罗德岛州这样的小州
So if smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island

204
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,580
不能达成共识
can't reach a consensus...

205
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,420
-嗯  -不  是这样的
- Right. - No, it's true.

206
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,190
如果一两个
I mean, if one or two of these

207
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,190
非常固执的国会成员
really stubborn members of Congress

208
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,690
决定顽固抵抗  可能要耗数月
decides they're going to hold this up, it could be months.

209
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,360
我正是这个意思
Look, that's what I'm saying.

210
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,880
得到26张选票并不容易
The road to 26 votes is not an easy one.

211
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
好吧  时局确实奇怪  米卡
All right. Strange days indeed, Mika.

212
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,650
这些是短篇小说的开头吗
So are these the start to short stories?

213
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,060
现在还不是什么  只是片段
They're nothing yet. Fragments.

214
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,130
碎片
Pieces.

215
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,340
显然这是关于我的
I mean, clearly, this is about me.

216
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,790
这是我母亲
This is my mother.

217
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,440
这是我们
And this is us.

218
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,610
-你不能写  -我要写
- You can't write-- - I'm writing.

219
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,700
这是我的工作  我是个作家
It's what I do. I'm a writer.

220
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,330
我知道你很不满  汤姆  但是
I know you're frustrated, Tom, but--

221
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,910
不是不满
I wouldn't say frustrated.

222
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,470
这是侵犯
Well, it's invasive.

223
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,680
-写你自己的经历  -这是我的经历
- Write about your own experiences. - This is my experience.

224
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,190
听着  汤姆
Listen, Tom,

225
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,330
我们决定弗兰西斯和我要留在这里
just because we've decided Francis and I need to stay here,

226
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,550
不代表你也是
doesn't mean you have to.

227
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,770
如果你有事
So if you have things you need to do,

228
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,220
就应该去做
you should go ahead and do them.

229
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,770
我这一天得说服参议院给我投票
I'll be spending my day convincing the Senate to vote for me,

230
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,870
不需要演讲
so there's no speeches necessary.

231
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,020
好
Yeah, okay.

232
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,460
你知道吗  我确实有事情要做
You know what? I do have some things to do.

233
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,890
我需要去找一些人  所以
Some people I need to check in with. So...

234
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,790
汤姆
Tom.

235
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,550
怎么了
Yeah?

236
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,060
什么事
Yes?

237
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,240
准备好了吗  安德伍德夫人
You ready, Mrs. Underwood?

238
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,310
我会安排一辆车等你
I'll have a car waiting for you.

239
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,350
你想先听好消息还是坏消息
So do you want the good news or the bad news first?

240
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,820
永远先听坏消息
Always the bad.

241
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,640
总统的支持率已跌至19%
The president's approvals are down to 19%.

242
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,400
好消息
And the good?

243
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,660
国会情况更糟
They're worse for Congress.

244
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,590
而你是30%
And you're at 30.

245
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,640
幸好我们现在要说服的是国会
Well, thankfully it's congress we have to convince now,

246
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,130
不是民众
not the public.

247
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,960
这些是选举前我们要解决的剩下的参议员
These are the remaining senators we'll target before the vote.

248
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,780
对了  都是女人
All women, by the way.

249
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,000
最大的挑战将是
The biggest challenges will be

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,870
印第安纳州的新晋参议员苏珊·纽曼
Indiana's freshman senator Susan Newman.

251
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,230
宪法律师
The constitutional lawyer?

252
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,800
以及夏威夷的凯芮·奎立马
And Hawaii's Kerry Kuilima,

253
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,870
她似乎很高兴
who seems to be enjoying

254
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,030
终于能有一次实权了
getting to wield a little power for once.

255
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,180
我必须告诉你  国会对同时为
I need to tell you, there is a lot of pushback on the Hill

256
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,120
总统和副总统投票抵触情绪很高
about the simultaneous vote for president and VP.

257
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,580
国民很担心这会导致总统副总统不同党
The country is terrified it'll lead to a split ticket.

258
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,610
有人可能阻挠议事
There's threats of a filibuster.

259
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,310
参议院现在是民主党的
Well, the Dems won the Senate,

260
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,450
他们想跟众议院一起投票的
and they want to vote when the House does.

261
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,160
这已经决定了
That decision's been made.

262
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,920
副总统也不会允许议员以任何形式
And the vice president won't allow a filibuster of any kind

263
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,120
阻挠议事
onto the floor.

264
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,950
夫人  你有没有考虑过这样的结果
Ma'am, have you contemplated how it could possibly work,

265
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,540
你做康威总统的副总统
you as vice president to President Conway?

266
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,990
不会那样的
That's not going to happen.

267
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,510
当然
Of course.

268
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,540
我倒是真知道奥古斯都·安德伍德的一件事
I did learn one true thing about Augustus Underwood.

269
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,610
什么事
What?

270
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,230
他死了  真死了
He was dead. Cold.

271
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,120
他的尸体被放在一辆马车上...
They put him on a cart...

272
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,390
上面有好多有待埋葬的尸体
bunch of dead bodies to bury.

273
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,300
一天一夜之后...
Then, after a full day and night...

274
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,910
他醒了
he woke up.

275
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,030
什么
What?

276
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,220
有人偷走了他的鞋和军服上的扣子  但是
Someone stole his shoes and the buttons off his uniform, but...

277
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,440
他活过来了
he lived.

278
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,310
几天后  他赶上了他所在的军团
Few days later, he caught up to his regiment.

279
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,960
真的吗
Really?

280
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,720
我得回去面对那些混乱了
I have to get back to the madness.

281
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,240
希望还能再见到你  总统先生
I hope I get to see you again, Mr. President.

282
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,010
艾瑞克...你不参加重演活动时
Eric... what do you do when you're not,

283
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,850
都干些什么
reenacting?

284
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,330
我是一名演员
I'm an actor.

285
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,740
有时候是吧
Sometimes.

286
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,690
只要有人雇  我也可以干其它的
I mean, I'd do a lot more if someone would let me.

287
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,250
现在  我主要做私人教练
So, right now, I'm mostly a personal trainer.

288
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,550
-私人教练  -是的
- A personal trainer? - Yeah.

289
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,200
你知道我的联系方式
You know where to find me.

290
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,580
还有  总统阁下...
And, sir...

291
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,670
不管情况看起来多糟糕...
no matter how dire things look...

292
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,690
你都能熬出头的
you're gonna come out of this alive.

293
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,020
你毕竟是安德伍德家的人
You're an Underwood, after all.

294
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,080
不  别耍嘴皮子  埃莉诺
No, don't... don't "Chief-of-staff" me, Eleanor.

295
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,480
不  不要给我他的行程
No, don't give me his schedule.

296
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,720
我不想知道
I don't want to hear

297
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,400
罗梅洛议员在会见选民
about how Congressman Romero is meeting with his constituents

298
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,240
或是滞留在阿西乐特快上了
or stuck on an Acela train.

299
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,090
你叫法齐奥  对吗
You know, it's Fazio, right?

300
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,770
是这么发音的吧
The pronunciation?

301
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,130
埃莉诺·法齐奥
Eleanor Fazio?

302
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,460
我只是想确认一下
I... I just want to be sure.

303
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,000
因为等总统获胜  他一定会获胜的
Because when the president wins, and he is going to win,

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,780
我会记得你的
I will remember your name.

305
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,030
我还是需要你过目一下这篇发布稿
I still need you to review this release.

306
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,370
很明显  目标是
Now, obviously, the goal is

307
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,700
抵住"躲藏"的论调
to combat the "hiding out" narrative,

308
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,640
强调他们正在做的工作
emphasizing the work that they're doing.

309
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,240
-私事吗  -公事
- Is it a personal matter? - Business.

310
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,540
我只有公事
It's always business.

311
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,440
我会签好字电邮给你的
I'll e-mail you my sign off.

312
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,170
等等
Wait a second.

313
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,630
我需要他们明天的最新行程
I need an update on their schedule for tomorrow.

314
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,730
-胜利就在眼前  -告诉我你是怎么知道的
- We're almost there. - I want to know how you found out.

315
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,470
如果他需要帮助
If he needs help,

316
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,230
等他入主白宫后随时可以找我
that can happen after he makes it to the White House.

317
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,210
马克  你还没有回答我的问题
Mark, you're not answering my question.

318
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,010
如果他接受治疗的消息  
If word of treatment,

319
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,950
任何形式的治疗  泄露了...
any kind of treatment, got out--

320
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,790
他的朋友给他看了那种治疗方法
His friend was showing him the therapy.

321
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,940
-仅此而已  -请不要侮辱我
- That's it. - Please don't insult me.

322
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,670
你以为你是谁
Who do you think you are?

323
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,320
插手我们生活的方方面面
Inserting yourself into every aspect of our lives.

324
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,140
你丈夫的选举需要帮助
Your husband's campaign needed help.

325
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,960
-我就伸出了援手  -是的  但是...
- Help arrived. - Yes, but--

326
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,230
这原来可是你的意思  对吧
Help that you, most of all, pushed for. Yes?

327
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,810
-谁告诉你虚拟现实疗法的  -他自己说的
- Who told you about the VR therapy? - He did.

328
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,110
我们走吧
Let's go.

329
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,000
怎么了
What's going on?

330
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,940
我就是在跟马克说我非常怀念马歇尔在的时候
I was just telling Mark how much I miss having Marshall around.

331
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,310
他还在啊
Well, he's still around.

332
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,300
你要去哪
Where are you going?

333
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,190
我忘拿包了
I forgot my bag.

334
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,780
就在这里
It's right here.

335
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,530
喂  是的
Hello. Yeah.

336
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,140
是的  他在
Yes, sir, he's right here.

337
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,900
是他
It's him.

338
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,360
议员先生
Congressman.

339
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,820
你根本不知道这可能会多糟
You have no idea how bad this could get.

340
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,920
我们可别迟到
We don't wanna be late.

341
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,220
我万分赞同
Well, I couldn't agree more.

342
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,680
她可能去了圣达菲
She might have gone to Santa Fe.

343
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,130
你不相信我  是吗
You don't believe me, do you?

344
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,050
我需要看到点切实的东西  丽萨
I would need to see something, Lisa. Something concrete.

345
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,580
我有照片  我有一张
I have a photo. I have one, but...

346
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,190
听我说
Listen.

347
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,580
看着我
Look at me.

348
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,140
你不是第一个来找我对安德伍德和他手下
You're not the first person to come here making false claims

349
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,200
提出虚假指控的人了
about Underwood and his cronies.

350
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,520
但我说的是实话
But I'm telling the truth.

351
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,130
但你说的一切都可能是报纸上读来的
Everything you're saying you could've read in the paper.

352
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,700
我就是这样知道他的身份的  因为报纸登了
That's how I realized who he was. His picture in the paper.

353
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,900
这样你的说法就更难证实了  我们在兜圈子
Which makes your story harder to prove. We're talking in circles.

354
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,530
那我车坏掉时  道格·斯坦普开车送我回家呢
What about Doug Stamper driving me home when my car broke down,

355
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,760
还跟我说他叫彼得  是卖保险的
telling me his name was Peter and that he sold insurance?

356
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,950
-没人能证实你的说法  -瑞秋
- No one can corroborate that story. - Rachel!

357
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,330
瑞秋可以
Rachel could.

358
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,000
-你该吃完  -我不饿
- You should finish that. - I'm not hungry.

359
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,960
或许我饿了  我不知道
Maybe I am. I don't know.

360
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,590
我想感谢你来联络我
I want to thank you for reaching out.

361
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,670
我不是说我不相信你
I am not saying I don't believe you.

362
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,610
但已经有足够可以
But there's already enough evidence out there

363
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,360
扳倒总统的证据了
to take the president down.

364
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,100
这次选举  会让他背负更多罪责
And now, with this election, he'll be accountable for even more.

365
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,320
-我确定  -我不在乎
- I'm certain of it. - I don't care.

366
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,450
我不在乎安德伍德  我要你去找道格·斯坦普
I don't care about Underwood. I want you to talk to Doug Stamper.

367
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,610
我要你查明我的...
I want you to find out what happened to my...

368
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,450
算了  拉倒吧
Whatever, forget it.

369
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,410
-等等  -谢谢你的三明治
- Uh. Hold on. - Thanks for the sandwich.

370
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,010
好吧  等等
All right. Hold on.

371
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,990
有一个关于林登·约翰逊的故事我很喜欢
There's a story that I love about LBJ.

372
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,020
那是64或65年的时候
Uh, it was back in '64 or '65.

373
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,150
有个议员在躲他  那议员回到自己的办公室
A congressman was ducking him... and he came back to his office

374
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,520
总统就坐在他的椅子上
to find the president sitting in his chair...

375
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,070
等着他
waiting for him.

376
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,630
总统一小时内要见到你
The president expects to see you within the hour.

377
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,730
法齐奥小姐会告诉你具体情况
Miss Fazio can give you the specifics.

378
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,660
-他戴着牛仔帽  -什么
- He was wearing his cowboy hat. - What?

379
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,050
约翰逊总统  你漏掉了故事最精彩的部分
President Johnson. You left out the best part of the story.

380
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,320
我们昨晚玩到那里闭店  多谢邀请
We closed the place down last night. Thanks for the invite.

381
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,980
我们几个人今晚还去那里
Bunch of us are headed back to the same spot tonight,

382
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,910
要一起来吗
if you wanna come.

383
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,860
好啊  他今天午饭吃的晚  4点才会回来
Cool. Uh, he has a late lunch today. Won't be back till 4:00.

384
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,300
-我就是来送这个  -好
- Oh, I just needed to drop this for him. - Sure.

385
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,590
下次  问就好
Next time, just ask.

386
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,610
今晚见
See you tonight.

387
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,610
你赌了一把  但输了
You gambled and you lost.

388
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,600
其实  跟八周前比  我党团席位增多了
Actually, my bloc gained seats more than eight weeks ago.

389
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,320
我猜你就是为这事找我
Which I suspect is why I'm here.

390
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,390
别高估了你的位置
Don't overestimate your position.

391
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,150
或是低估了我的
Or underestimate mine.

392
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,850
你还没当选总统呢  先生
You still haven't been elected president, sir.

393
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,370
是啊  但如果党派背弃了你
Yeah, but the presidency won't matter

394
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,920
总统之职就无所谓了吧
once the party turns its back on you, will it?

395
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,950
等鲍勃·博奇教训好了你其他的绵羊
When Bob Birch puts all the rest of your sheep in line,

396
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,830
你会求着不被孤立
you'll be begging to come in from the cold.

397
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,870
两年后  你会回到凤凰城
And two years from now, you'll be back in Phoenix

398
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,550
一遍遍在脑海里回顾这一刻
replaying this very moment over and over again in your mind

399
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,890
意识到  这就是结束的开始
and realizing it was the beginning of the end.

400
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,750
帕特里夏·惠特克和民主党
Patricia Whittaker and the Democratic Party

401
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,320
会跟你撇清关系
will wipe their hands of you.

402
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,860
-我是忠于党的  -那是应该的
- I'm loyal to the party. - As you should be.

403
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,420
你应该这么说
As you should say.

404
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,570
但说真的
But really...

405
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,680
你有什么筹码
what's your leverage?

406
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,420
委员会  那已经完了
The committee? That's done.

407
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,470
瞧  你已经献了身  艾力克斯
You see, you've already put out, Alex,

408
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,760
威尔·康威却不打算带你去舞会
and Will Conway is not taking you to the prom.

409
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,140
我跟州长的谈话
My conversations with the governor

410
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,140
和我可能的立场...
and any position that I may or may not have--

411
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,930
听听自己的话  你相信自己吗
Oh, listen to yourself. Do you even believe you?

412
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,290
你作为一个
You are awfully confident

413
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,600
已经输了一次选举的人  好自信啊
for someone who's already lost the election once.

414
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,280
帮个忙  暂时忘记总统的事
Do me a favor. Forget the presidency for just a moment.

415
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,950
你没有...资本
You don't have... the capital

416
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,960
来推动你掀起的国会革命
to build on the congressional revolution that you've started,

417
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,840
不管是政治上还是其他的
politically or otherwise.

418
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,600
我们的运动想让事态爆发
Our movement wants to explode things--

419
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,980
得了  少拿那套革新派公关套路我
Oh, please. Spare me your progressive PR bullshit.

420
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,960
你和他们想要的东西一样
You want what they all want.

421
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,380
权力  更好的地位
Access. A better seat at the table.

422
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,480
你的名字在他人之前
Your name before the rest.

423
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,220
这我可以给你
And that is something that I can give you.

424
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,120
你想换取多少选票呢
And how many votes do you want in exchange?

425
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
你不断增长的党团给我三张就行
Just three from your ever-growing bloc

426
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,190
我就能在关键代表团获得胜利
would assure me the win in key delegations.

427
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,340
具体点
Specifically?

428
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,030
缅因州  威斯康星州和新罕布什尔还未定
Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire are still in play.

429
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,340
三个全要
All three?

430
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,790
我相信你  议员  想知道为什么吗
I believe in you, Congressman. Do you wanna know why?

431
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,780
说吧
Tell me.

432
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,490
因为我相信野心
Because I trust ambition.

433
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,440
-那这是直截了当的贿赂喽  -不  议员
- So this is a straight-up bribe. - Oh, no, Congressman.

434
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,200
贿赂是你可以拒绝的
A bribe is something you can refuse.

435
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,730
鉴于你的经验没有我丰富
Now, since you haven't been around the block as many times as I have,

436
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,430
我来教教你这事怎么办吧
let me walk you through how this works.

437
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,960
抱歉  总统  但我知道是怎么回事
Excuse me, Mr. President, but I do know how this is done.

438
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,440
那太好了
Oh, well, that's good to hear.

439
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,880
我从缅因州开始吧  她欠我的
I'll start with Maine. She owes me.

440
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,550
我们以前见过一次的  总统先生
You know, we did meet once before, Mr. President.

441
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,850
2012年大会的一次晚宴上
At a dinner, during the 2012 convention.

442
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,460
-我还想向你自我介绍来着  -然后呢
- I tried to introduce myself to you... - And?

443
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,850
-你不记得我了  是吗  -为什么要记得呢
- You don't remember, do you? - Why would I?

444
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,690
主持人为什么那么在意布洛哈特的意见
Why is the moderator so interested in Brockhart's opinion?

445
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,540
所有人都突然忘记我才是总统候选人了吗
Has everyone suddenly forgotten now I'm at the top of the ticket?

446
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,820
当然没有
No, of course not.

447
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,440
结束了吗
Are we done here?

448
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,340
是啊  我们谈谈明天的日程吧
Yeah. We should talk about tomorrow's schedule.

449
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,620
目前票数不错
Uh, vote's looking good now.

450
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,710
我们还得尽量多找些议员谈
We still need to talk to as many congressmen as we can.

451
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,400
你去安排  然后打给我们
Well, you figure it out and give us a call.

452
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,240
别再安排针对军事委员会的活动了
And, uh, enough with the events targeting the Armed Services.

453
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,620
我们在这边拉票已经到极限了
We got as many Congress people as we could get out of this.

454
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,070
别介意  将军  但我们该分头行动  好吗
No offense, General, but we need to divide and conquer. Okay?

455
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,970
威尔  我之前跟马克谈了
Will, I was speaking with Mark...

456
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,000
-怎么  -我想告诉你
- Yeah. - ...and I want you to know,

457
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,410
如果你需要谈什么  我随时奉陪
if you need to talk about anything, I'm available.

458
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,710
我唯一需要的支持  将军
The only support I need, General...

459
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,590
就是一个副总统对总统的支持  好吗
is that of a vice president to his president. Okay?

460
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,220
塔伯特参议员的首要考虑是经济适用房
Senator Talbert's priorities are affordable housing

461
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,100
和堵住企业税务漏洞
and closing corporate tax loopholes.

462
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,530
尤其是高等教育普及
And access to higher education especially.

463
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,010
通话在10点
The call is in ten.

464
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,020
艾丹·麦卡伦为什么跑了
Why did Aidan Macallan run away?

465
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,090
什么
What?

466
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,410
麦卡伦为什么跑了
Why did Macallan run away?

467
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,630
我也不知道
I wish I could tell you.

468
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,310
时间不多了
Clock's ticking.

469
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,240
请给我汤姆·耶茨司机的号码
Yes, give me Tom Yates' driver's number, please.

470
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,940
喂
Yes.

471
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,710
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
纽约
New York.

473
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,460
你一路开去了纽约
You drove all the way to New York?

474
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,870
在哪
Where?

475
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,650
他跟谁在一起
Who's he with?

476
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,970
我不知道  一个女人  年纪较长
I don't know. A woman. Older.

477
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,580
我不知道那要怎么做  夫人
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.

478
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,250
是  我试试
Yes. Yes, I'll try.

479
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,610
不  我理解你的担忧  参议员
No, I understand your concern, Senator.

480
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,010
学生贷款改革是你的优先考虑
Student loan reform is a priority for you,

481
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,560
那么它就也是总统和我的优先考虑
so it will be a priority for the president and me.

482
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,070
是的  没错
Yes. Yes, I do.

483
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,120
露易丝  你是党派中流砥柱
Well, Louise, you as a pillar of the party,

484
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,370
如果你明天能帮我  我会感激不尽
it will be much appreciated if I can get your help tomorrow.

485
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,430
到时就你和我  还有几个你的
And it'll just be you and me and a couple of your...

486
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,400
参议院女同事
female colleagues in the Senate.

487
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,500
好  那么我期待与你有成效地谈谈
Okay, well, I look forward to a productive dialogue.

488
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,180
-迟到总比不来好  -抱歉我错过了晚餐
- Better late than never. - Sorry I missed dinner.

489
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,880
为什么坐后面
Why the back?

490
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,720
我在假装你是优步  帮帮忙
I'm pretending you're an Uber. Just help me out.

491
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,750
我的小姑子  你没来她就来了
My sister-in-law. She came when you couldn't.

492
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,530
你觉得死者会鄙视我们吗
Do you think the dead judge us?

493
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,180
不会
No.

494
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,890
你最喜欢他做什么
What did he do that you liked the most?

495
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,060
在床上
Here... in bed.

496
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,560
坐姿最好
Sitting up was the best.

497
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,780
腿缠着彼此
Legs around each other.

498
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,550
他会把右手
He'd run his right hand

499
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,530
伸到我脖子后面  插进我的头发里拽着
up the back of my neck into my hair and pull it.

500
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,110
把我的头发和脑袋往后拽
My hair and my head back...

501
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,340
然后呢
And?

502
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,510
然后用另一只手  把我拉进拉出
And with the other hand, he'd pull me in and out.

503
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
他始终看着我
Always looking at me.

504
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,640
看到我
Seeing me.

505
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,770
你要我那么做吗
You want me to do that?

506
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,830
嗯
Yeah.

507
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,340
这里真好  几乎听不到他们的吼声
It's so nice in here. You can hardly hear them.

508
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,160
相信我  我听得到的
Oh, trust me, I can hear them.

509
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,900
加上新罕布什尔  多少了
With New Hampshire, it's what?

510
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,800
24  加缅因州25
Twenty-four. With Maine, 25.

511
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,160
-如果拿下威斯康星就是26  -汤姆呢
- Twenty-six if we get Wisconsin. - Where's Tom?

512
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,360
他去喘口气了
He needed to get some air.

513
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,130
-威斯康星很顽固  -那还有谁
- Wisconsin is being stubborn. - Then who else?

514
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,540
爱荷华  或许科罗拉多  那是24  25
Iowa, maybe Colorado, 24, 25.

515
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,680
你的曾曾曾祖父奥古斯都怎么样了
How was your great-great-great-grandfather Augustus?

516
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,090
他叫艾瑞克
He goes by Eric.

517
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,090
艾瑞克
Eric.

518
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,640
他很欣赏我的手艺
He admired my craftsmanship.

519
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,220
-我们该争取一下北达科他  -同意
- We should make a play for North Dakota. - Agreed.

520
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,670
在参议院  你应该可以拉密苏里的票
In the Senate, I think you can swing some votes from Missouri.

521
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,050
你问莉安麦卡伦的事了吗
Did you ask LeAnn about Macallan?

522
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,500
她并不知情  我相信她
She didn't know anything. I believe her.

523
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,360
我们又得戒了
We have to quit again.

524
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,000
否则  会害死我们的
Otherwise, they'll kill us.

525
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,050
麦卡伦不见踪影  但他去过那儿  留下了财物
No Macallan. He was there, though. Left his belongings.

526
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,570
国家警察那里有消息吗
Anything from the National Police?

527
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,630
没有  中情局的内部人士
No. CIA's man in the palace

528
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,700
甚至不确定他是否还在雅加达
isn't even sure he's still in Jakarta.

529
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,000
他们会找到他的  莉安  我只能说这么多
They'll find him, LeAnn. That's all I can give you.

530
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,220
多谢帮忙
I appreciate your help.

531
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,140
凯芮  苏珊  需要点什么
Kerry, Susan, what can I get you?

532
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,800
-不用  谢谢  -水就行
- I'm fine, thanks. - I'm good with water.

533
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,330
-你呢  露易丝  -你喝什么
- What about you, Louise? - What are you having?

534
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,440
-伏特加加冰  -给我也来一杯
- Splash of vodka on ice. - Make it two.

535
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,280
苏珊和我来的路上谈了  克莱尔
Susan and I were talking on the way over, Claire.

536
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,050
这场选举的混乱让我们
This election mess has left us

537
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,060
都面临着一些可怕的可能性
all facing some scary possibilities.

538
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,940
-康威拿下众议院  -这还远非定数
- Conway wins in the House-- - Which is far from inevitable.

539
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,940
但如果真发生总统副总统不同党
But if a split ticket were to happen...

540
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,920
那对国家会不利的
it would be bad for this country.

541
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,580
不  康威才对国家不利
No, Conway is what would be bad for this country.

542
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,040
希望众议院能做出正确选择
Let's hope the House does the right thing.

543
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,670
但就参议院而言
But as far as the Senate,

544
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,630
我很高兴有唐纳德·布莱斯掌舵
I am very grateful that we have Donald Blythe steering that ship.

545
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,710
安德伍德夫人  我很抱歉这么说
Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this,

546
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,440
但不管你能拿出什么
but no matter what you're offering here,

547
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,230
我都不能支持总统
I can't support the president.

548
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,500
也因此不能支持你
And, by extension, I can't support you.

549
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,710
不是你的问题  克莱尔  是他
It's not you, Claire. It's him.

550
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,460
苏珊和我在这事上的意见是一致的
Susan and I are on the same page about this.

551
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,300
如果重点不是弗兰西斯·安德伍德呢
What if this isn't about Francis Underwood, huh?

552
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:13,150
前途大好的是克莱尔·安德伍德
It's Claire Underwood who has the promising future.

553
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,590
我希望一个女人入主白宫
I want a woman in the White House.

554
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,740
如果她得从副总统做起  那好
And if she has to start as a vice president, fine.

555
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,050
但时候到了
But it's time.

556
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,950
-时候到了  -我赞同  露易丝
- It's time. - I hear that, Louise,

557
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,530
但我直说吧
but I'll say it...

558
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,070
投票给你  就是投给弗兰克·安德伍德
A vote for you is a vote for Frank Underwood.

559
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,780
我理解你们对弗兰西斯历史的担忧  真的
Listen, I understand your concerns about Francis' record. I do.

560
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,150
如果康威赢了
If Conway wins,

561
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,190
难道你们不希望有个民主党人克制着他吗
wouldn't you want a Democrat to keep him in check?

562
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,750
如果给我投票不等于给弗兰西斯投票呢
And what if a vote for me isn't necessarily a vote for Francis?

563
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,520
21票确定是你  先生
Twenty-one promised for you, sir.

564
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,050
康威是23
Twenty-three for Conway.

565
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,990
两个僵持  四个未知
Two deadlocked. Four unknown.

566
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,650
但我觉得党团会议之后情况会变动
But I think things will shift once they caucus.

567
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,660
-好  叫他进来  -是  先生
- All right, let's bring him in. - Yes, sir.

568
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,350
-请坐  -我不久留
- Have a seat. - I won't be long.

569
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,030
那就站着吧
Well, then, stand like a man

570
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,240
像个不知是否该坐下的人
who doesn't know whether to sit or not.

571
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,660
罗梅洛议员  你为我带来好消息了吗
Congressman Romero, do you have good news for me?

572
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,780
你的革新人士想明白了吗
Have your progressives seen the light?

573
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,010
我已经尽力了  总统先生  我无法说服他们
I did what I could, Mr. President. I couldn't sway the bloc.

574
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,510
无法  还是不愿
Couldn't... or wouldn't?

575
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,420
缅因和新罕布什尔还不明朗
Maine and New Hampshire are noncommittal.

576
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,560
沃考特议员在让威斯康星支持康威
Congressman Wolcott is turning Wisconsin for Conway.

577
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,560
告诉我点别的事实
Tell me a different truth.

578
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,340
他们不听我的
They aren't listening to me.

579
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,030
他们相信  与让康威当选相比
They believe supporting you would do more damage

580
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,150
支持你会给民主党和国家造成更大损害
to the Democratic Party and the country than a Conway presidency.

581
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,160
很遗憾  竟然走到这一步
Well, I am sorry that it has come to this.

582
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,390
我也是  我们肯定还会再见的  先生
As am I. I'm sure we'll meet again, sir.

583
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,580
是啊  但你走之前  好好看看这间屋子
Yes, but before you go, just take a look around this room.

584
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,310
仔细看每处细节  每个方面
Study every detail, every aspect.

585
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,700
因为这是你最后一次踏进这里了
Because this is the last time you will ever step foot in here.

586
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,100
抱歉我没帮上更多忙
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

587
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,770
想想吧  你本能让自己因为很多其他事
And to think you could have made yourself memorable

588
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,720
被世人铭记的
in so many other ways.

589
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,630
我会确保他再进不了其他委员会  先生
I'll make sure he never sees another committee, sir.

590
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,540
不  他希望我们还击  让他感觉更强大
Oh, no. He wants us to put up a fight, make him feel bigger.

591
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,190
他只不过是看了民调数据  就以为我有麻烦
He's just read some polls and thinks I'm in trouble.

592
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,920
所以他才攻击我
That's why he's coming after me.

593
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,430
好吧  我们有48小时
All right, we have 48 hours.

594
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,400
我得攻下科罗拉多  稳住田纳西
I have to work Colorado and shore up Tennessee.

595
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,530
但哪怕不惜一切  也要让
But Maine, Wisconsin and New hampshire

596
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,170
缅因  威斯康星和新罕布什尔回心转意
must be turned by any means necessary.

597
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,570
所有党团会议周四中午之前都会结束
All caucusing will end by noon on Thursday,

598
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,730
下午两点
and then the vote in both

599
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,400
参众两院开始投票
the House and the Senate is scheduled for 2:00.

600
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,420
我不做决定  查克  我只是传达而已
Well... I don't make the decisions, Chuck. I just relay them.

601
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,250
不  不  目前不做声明
No. No, there will not be a statement at this time.

602
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,880
因为投票结果出来前无话可说
Well, because there's nothing to state until after the vote.

603
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,080
关上门
Close the door.

604
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,190
嗯  对
Right. Yes.

605
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,220
对
Yes.

606
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,950
求你别再逼我说"对"了
Yeah, please don't make me say yes again.

607
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,570
美国现在真是疯了
Crazy days in these United States.

608
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,880
你想告诉我  是什么重要到
So you wanna tell me what was so important

609
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,340
我得放你进来
I had to get you through the gates?

610
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,500
有个叫丽萨·威廉姆斯的女孩来过
Girl named Lisa Williams came in.

611
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,260
说她曾是瑞秋·波斯纳的女朋友
Says she was Rachel Posner's girlfriend.

612
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,810
她说道格·斯坦普认识瑞秋
Said Doug Stamper knew Rachel.

613
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,650
觉得他可能和瑞秋失踪有关
Feels like maybe he was involved in her disappearance.

614
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,830
她说道格·斯坦普这个名字了吗
And she said the words "Doug Stamper"?

615
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,640
瑞秋·波斯纳失踪的时间
Rachel Posner went missing around the time

616
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
正好是斯坦普被劫车  脑袋被砸的时候
Stamper was carjacked and had his head bashed in.

617
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,030
这个丽萨觉得
And this Lisa thinks...

618
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,110
她也不太确定
Well, she's not sure exactly.

619
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,400
她能证明其中有联系吗
Well, can she prove a connection?

620
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,890
现在都只是直觉
It's all instinct at this point.

621
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,950
拜托
Come on.

622
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,260
你要是想参观白宫
You want a tour of the White House,

623
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,090
可以直接跟我说嘛
you could just straight up ask me for one.

624
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,600
-汉默施密特  -他看重这事吗
- Hammerschmidt. - Is he making anything of it?

625
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,710
还不  但关于她的资料已经在他桌上了
Not yet. But the information about her is on the top of his desk.

626
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,900
丽萨·威廉姆斯
Lisa Williams.

627
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,250
格雷森先生  三号线有人找
Mr. Grayson, you have a call on line three.

628
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,930
我得工作了
Well, I gotta get back to it.

629
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,560
要是汤姆继续跟进她  就告诉我
If Tom follows up on her, let me know.

630
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,170
-谢谢你给的通行证  -是临时的
- Thanks for the pass. - It's temporary.

631
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,150
好吧
Okay.

632
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,020
-莉安·哈维  -你总熬夜
- LeAnn Harvey. - Always burning the midnight oil.

633
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,820
-艾丹  -你准备好来找我了吗
- Aidan? - You ready to join me?

634
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,530
你知道你把我推进了多危险的境地吗
Do you have any idea how much jeopardy you have put me in?

635
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,790
你应该趁还有机会逃出来
You should've gotten out when you had the chance.

636
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,340
你觉得你就逃出来了
You think you're out?

637
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,020
-听着  我需要你帮我个忙  -你在哪
- Listen, I need you to do me a favor. - Where are you?

638
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,940
让联调局  中情局
Get the FBI, CIA,

639
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,970
和其他在找我的人都停下  马上
and whoever else is looking for me to stop, now.

640
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,810
好  艾丹  你就
Okay, Aidan, you know, just...

641
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,560
先回来  我们一起想办法
come back here, and we will figure this out together.

642
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,920
要是他们继续找我
If they keep coming after me,

643
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,030
我就开始泄露关于安德伍德夫妇的秘密
I will start leaking things about the Underwoods.

644
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,100
你不想那么做的
You don't wanna do that.

645
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,750
你不知道你现在是在为什么人工作  莉安
You have no idea who you're working for, LeAnn.

646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,010
该死
God damn it.

647
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,960
有新情况向总统汇报吗
You have an update for the president?

648
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,300
我今天基本上一直在忙着应付参议员
I've been juggling senators most of the day.

649
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,090
你那缅因州的议员呢
And your congressman from Maine?

650
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,100
依然是我朋友的父亲  依然没时间见面
Is still my friend's father and is still too busy to meet.

651
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
威斯康星和新罕布什尔也一样
So was Wisconsin and New Hampshire,

652
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,250
我逼他们就见到了
until I forced them to.

653
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,960
你有你的风格  我有我的
You have your style, I have mine.

654
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,790
总统不在乎风格  莉安
The president doesn't care about style, LeAnn.

655
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,330
周四前把议员的票拉到位就行
Just get the congressman by the vote on Thursday.

656
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,180
威尔刚进来了
Will just walked in.

657
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,560
嗯
Yeah.

658
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,320
行
Okay.

659
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,240
再联系  拜
Talk soon. Bye.

660
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,730
-你妈妈  -对  她向你问好
- That your mom? - Yeah. She sends her best.

661
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,830
好吧
Yeah.

662
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,900
-查理人呢  -在客厅
- Where's Charlie? - In the living room.

663
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,730
莉莉在小房间玩
Lily's playing in the den.

664
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,010
-你要去哪  -我该换衣服了
- Where are you going? - I should change.

665
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,100
-你一直躲着我  汉娜  -拜托
- You keep walking away from me, Hannah. - Oh, please.

666
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,690
你为什么邀请他来
Why would you invite him here?

667
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,580
这个时候
Now?

668
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,360
他是朋友  你的朋友
He's a friend. He's your friend.

669
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,100
我想也许...
And I thought maybe...

670
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,180
你会有兴趣看一看
it'd be something that you'd be interested in looking at.

671
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,250
我在尽力而为
I'm doing all I can.

672
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,510
-尽力而为  -是的
- All you can? - Yes.

673
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,540
质疑我
Like doubt me?

674
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
以为你比我更了解我自己的精神状况
Like think that you know better what's in my mind than I do?

675
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,190
要知道  是你告诉马克的
You know, you're the one who told Mark.

676
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,060
我还得否认我跟那事有关
I had to deny I had anything to do with it.

677
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,440
要知道这些人  汉娜  厄舍和马歇尔
See, these people, Hannah... Usher and Marshall...

678
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,860
他们是雇工  不能信他们
they're hired hands. They can't be trusted.

679
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,350
布洛哈特也是为了自己
And Brockhart, he's in it for himself.

680
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,930
但你...亲爱的  我的爱人
But... but you, my darling, my love--

681
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,710
-别说了  -别说什么
- Stop it. - Stop what?

682
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,500
你能怎么样  带孩子回娘家
What are you gonna do? Take the kids and go to your mom?

683
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,760
你不会这么做的
As if you would.

684
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,070
你连白宫的瓷器都挑好了
You already picked out the White House china.

685
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,760
你最大的心愿就是当上总统
You want this more than anything. To be president.

686
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,630
这也成了我的心愿  你胆敢来指责我
Don't you dare judge me now that I want it, too.

687
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,710
是  议员  安排航程也算贿赂
Yes, Congressman, but flights are considered bribes.

688
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,770
是  议员  我们担心的不是你的酒驾
Yes, Congressman, it's not your DUIs that concern us,

689
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,420
而是你女儿的
it's your daughter's.

690
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,810
那你本该把开销藏得更深
Well, you should've done a better job hiding the payouts.

691
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,490
拜托
I mean, really.

692
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,690
嗯  我相信你是  他多大来着
Yes, I'm sure you are... but how old was he again?

693
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,280
对  他参加过合唱团  对吧
Yes, and he was in the choir, is that right?

694
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,990
但你没法把邮件删得不留痕迹
But you can never erase an e-mail,

695
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,470
我过世的姑姑都知道
even my dead aunt knows that.

696
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,970
好吧  你尽快回复我
Well, get back to me as soon as you can.

697
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,620
-怎么样  -缅因州终于搞定了  先生
- So? - Maine finally looks solid, sir.

698
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,370
但新罕布什尔还没有
New Hampshire doesn't, though.

699
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,430
我坐在这里好几个小时
I've been sitting in here for hours

700
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,540
想方设法取得了一些成效
busting my ass, getting some results.

701
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,530
我们本应拿下新罕布什尔的
We should have secured New Hampshire.

702
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,010
莉安怎么拿下缅因州的
How did LeAnn get Maine?

703
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,630
对方欠她人情
She cashed in a favor.

704
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,690
那你为什么不能用同一招
Well, why couldn't you do the same goddamn thing?

705
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,440
我想不通
It doesn't make sense.

706
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,860
我以为我说服他了
I thought I had him. I mean...

707
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,850
不只是新罕布什尔  威斯康星本来也该拿下的
And it's not just New Hampshire. Wisconsin should've folded.

708
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,870
本来
Should have?

709
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,640
怎么回事  道格  你怎么了
What's going on, Doug? What's happening?

710
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,070
是你的投入  还是忠心出了问题
Is there some issue with your commitment? Your loyalty?

711
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,830
什么
What?

712
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,110
或许你就不值得我信任
Perhaps you just aren't worthy of my trust.

713
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,020
我为你费尽心力
I have given everything to you.

714
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,300
我的整个职业生涯几乎都给了你  弗兰克
Almost the entirety of my professional life, Frank.

715
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,600
你注意语气
You watch your tone.

716
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,070
我做的那些事...
The things I've done...

717
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,920
为了保住你的位子  我做的那些事...
The things that I have done to help keep you here,

718
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,680
你居然还质疑我的忠心
and you're gonna question my loyalty?

719
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,470
如果我们不能赢
Well, if we can't win,

720
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,720
那我们得确保康威也不能赢
we have to make sure that Conway doesn't either.

721
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,380
缅因州支持我们  那他就拿不到26票
Maine coming over only means he won't get to 26.

722
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,720
僵局不是胜局  但至少...
A deadlock isn't a win. But at least...

723
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,270
抱歉  道格  我刚才失态了
I'm sorry, Doug. I was out of line.

724
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,440
我们继续工作吧
Let's get back to work.

725
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,430
不只是他如何处理了那些数据
It's not just what he did with all the data.

726
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,350
艾丹之前能接触到一切
Aidan had access to everything.

727
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,890
我们得让中情局和联调局不去查他
We need to get the CIA and FBI off his trail,

728
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,980
我需要你的帮助
and I need your help.

729
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,470
你在制造麻烦  莉安
You're causing problems, LeAnn,

730
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,740
我们现在最要不得麻烦了
which is the last thing that we can afford right now.

731
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,330
麦卡伦是作茧自缚
Macallan sealed his own fate.

732
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,000
我拿下了缅因州  道格
I delivered Maine, Doug,

733
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
你可没处理好新罕布什尔
which is more than you can say about New Hampshire.

734
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,360
算我欠你人情
I'll owe you.

735
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,510
还不够
Not enough.

736
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,030
总统跟你说过艾丹的事吗
Has the president spoken to you about Aidan at all?

737
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,850
没有
No.

738
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,970
他在狙杀名单上吗
Is he on a kill list?

739
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,890
美利坚合众国没有狙杀名单  莉安
The United States of America doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.

740
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,710
我是唯一阻止麦卡公布他手上的东西的人
I am the only thing preventing Mac from releasing what he has.

741
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,220
我猜不管那是什么  你也牵涉其中
And my guess is, whatever it is, it'll implicate you, too.

742
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,450
我错了吗  道格
Am I wrong, Doug?

743
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,480
米切尔参议员身边的人告诉了我这消息
Someone close to Senator Mitchell woke me up with the news.

744
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,950
让副总统接电话
Get me the vice president on the phone.

745
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,100
没用
That is not going to help.

746
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,930
你打算怎么处理
Well, how do you intend on dealing with it?

747
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,400
唐纳德
Donald.

748
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,960
-别这么做  -克莱尔
- Don't do it. - Claire--

749
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,410
我知道你和米切尔参议员在谋划什么
I know what you and Senator Mitchell were planning.

750
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,650
做你本该做的事
Do what you were supposed to do.

751
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,110
取消阻挠议事  好让参议院能投票
Move the anti-filibuster measure forward so the Senate can vote

752
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,250
-选我担任副总统  -不行
- and elect me vice president. - No.

753
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,550
-不行  -各方声音都应该被听到
- No? - All voices should be heard

754
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,860
出于对美国人民的尊重
out of respect for the American people

755
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,480
也因为今天参议院投票的重要性
and the gravity of the vote before the Senate today,

756
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,850
自1825年起  这还是首次
the first like this since 1825.

757
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,330
众议院即将投票  唐纳德  怎么回事
The House is about to vote, Donald. What is going on?

758
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,460
我们把这事弄完  你就能回家了
Let's get this done so you can go home.

759
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,880
看上去康威要赢了
It looks like Conway is going to win.

760
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,750
不管别人跟你说了什么
And no matter what people have told you,

761
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,390
参议院会投给布洛哈特
the Senate is voting for Brockhart.

762
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,120
-国家高于政党  克莱尔  -你在耍滑头吗
- It's country over party, Claire. - Are you flexing?

763
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,830
我想拖到众议院完成投票
I'm stalling until the House vote happens

764
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,990
好让参议院据结果投票
and then the Senate votes accordingly.

765
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,440
你要那样对待
You'd do that to the party

766
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,220
你将全部事业倾注其中的政党吗
to which you've devoted your entire career?

767
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,320
国家需要透明和决议
The country needs clarity and resolution.

768
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,770
那是最重要的事
That's the most important thing.

769
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,980
四年后还会有选举
There'll be another election in four years.

770
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,260
但听我说
But look...

771
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,930
弗兰西斯昏迷时  我看到了你的样子
I saw you when Francis was in the coma.

772
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,540
当得到机会时你展现出的能力
What you're capable of when given the opportunity.

773
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,280
你今后还有机会  我会为你投票
You still have a shot down the road. I'd vote for you.

774
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,590
不管你怎么想  我知道我票数够了
Whatever you think, I know I have the numbers.

775
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,280
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

776
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,980
但拜托
But come on.

777
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,900
你不像他  耐心点
You're not like him. Be patient.

778
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,880
你是个傻瓜  唐纳德  一直都是
You're a fool, Donald. You always were.

779
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,950
你和你三句不离的那个蠢亡妻
You and your dumb, dead wife that you never, ever shut up about.

780
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,400
有原则  理想主义
Principled? Idealistic?

781
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,970
捍卫人民  你实际做过什么
A champion for the people? What did you ever actually do?

782
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,230
什么也没有
Nothing.

783
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,200
伟大的斗士  我看不是
The great crusader? I don't think so.

784
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,370
你只是喜欢你现在这副傻瓜的样子
You just liked the position of the bumbling idiot that you are.

785
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,050
乐观主义者  理想主义者
The optimist. The idealist.

786
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,820
你太喜欢了以至于你甚至不能达成一笔协议
You loved it so much that you couldn't even make a deal

787
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,680
或者推进一件事
or move a single thing forward.

788
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,200
你什么也没有留下
You have a legacy of nothing.

789
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,980
取消阻挠议事  让共和党别碍事
Sign the measure, get the Republicans off the floor,

790
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,950
马上开始投票
start the vote now.

791
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,480
你知道我刚刚意识到什么吗
Do you know what I just realized?

792
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,180
你的姓名首字母
Your initials...

793
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,730
少了N和T[贱人]
they're missing an "N" and a "T".

794
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,400
投票无结果  总统先生
The vote is inconclusive, Mr. President.

795
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,330
你和康威都没达到26票
Neither you nor Conway to 26.

796
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,930
还有机会  克莱尔怎么样
Still alive. What about Claire?

797
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,420
这不可能
This is impossible.

798
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,530
我和你一样惊讶
I'm as surprised as you are.

799
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,790
缅因州  毫无征兆
Maine. There was no heads-up on that.

800
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,450
我知道这令人沮丧  这本该结束了
Look, I know this is frustrating. It should be over.

801
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,480
我是总统
I... I'm the president.

802
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,560
我不管他们说什么  我
I don't care what they say, I...

803
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,110
我就是该死的美国总统
I'm fucking President of the United States.

804
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,040
不  你不是
No, you're not.

805
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,670
直到众议院做出决定
The vice president will be acting president

806
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,580
副总统将代总统职
for as long as it takes the House to decide.

807
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,560
我该去打几个电话
I should make some calls.

809
00:49:38,680 --> 00:50:38,680
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}美国总统选举的过程是  选举日注册选民投票
(有的州在选举日前也可以投票  但有的州只能在当日投票)
投票结束后开始计票  媒体根据计票结果  用自己的模型得出各州结果
拿到271张选举人票为胜  如果是平局  则由众议院投票决定总统
但媒体公布结果后  具体的计票还要继续  直到统计出所有的选票
如果哪个州结果过于相近  按部分州的法律  会自动启动重新计票
计票结束后  选举委员会确定胜者  一般由州长来签名认证
需注意的是  根据法律  投票日选的其实不是总统
而是"选举人"  也就各州的"投票代表"
而选举委员会和州长认证的  也是各州的选举人名单
选举人需在大选后去华盛顿参加选举人会议
跟其他州的代表一起  再投一次票  那一次才算真正选出总统

811
00:50:38,680 --> 00:51:38,680
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}当然大选夜之后的选举人再度投票  只是象征性的
不过美国只有29个州有法律规定  选举人在华盛顿开选举人会时
必须根据本州的选举结果投票  所以会出现个别不忠诚的选举人
在最后投票时  选择跟本州选民选举结果不同的候选人
另外在1876年大选出现选派选举人时产生争议的情况后
1877年国会立法  规定如果各州的选举人人选有争议
则由国会来决定该州的选举人  另外这个法律还规定
各州必须在选举人会议前6天向国会提交选举认证结果
在选举夜  媒体根据自己的模型判断胜负
但在法律上  必须所有的票都统计结束
由负责选举的官员进行公证后  结果才正式生效
