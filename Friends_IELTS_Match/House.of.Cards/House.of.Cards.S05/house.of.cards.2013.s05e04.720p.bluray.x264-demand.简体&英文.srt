74
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,640
最好别让他们看到你证件上的名字
Better not let them see the name on your credentials.

75
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
那些人很爱戴他们的总统

81
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,900
我要做实况报道
I'm doing commentary.

82
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,530
那么迟早会有人问我
Which means eventually someone gets to ask me

83
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,050
我的文章有没有影响到总统的败选
if my articles affected the president's loss.

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,570

107
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,700
我们没法早点
we're not gonna be able to get over to the ballroom

108
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,970

109
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,170
但等我们到了那里
But once we do get there,

110

First time I've fucked a president.

118
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,620
-不要这样讲  -马歇尔说...

119
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,280
我还不是总统
I'm not a president yet.

120
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,090

总统先生
Oh, Mr. President...

129
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
这让我们猝不及防
this is catching us all off guard over here.

130
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
州的  当地的  我们都不知道
State, local, we had no idea.

131

134
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,450
州长  很抱歉  但我们必须行动

135
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,270
我直接联系了当地执法部门
I contacted local law enforcement directly.

136
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,980
我是过了好一会儿才知道
Well, it took a while to get to me.

137
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,130
米切  反恐处助理局长要与我们分享一些
Mitch, the Counterterrorism Director will be sharing information

138
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,730
绝不能外泄的信息
that we must keep amongst ourselves.

139
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,830
我们不想做任何会影响今天投票的事
We do not want to do anything that affects today's voting.

140

143
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,720
-嗯  -那里离体育场很近

144
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,640
嫌疑人不在公寓里
The suspect was not in his apartment,

145
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,150
但是我们发现了制造炸弹的材料
but we did find bomb-making material.

146
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,120
-天哪  -米切
- Jesus, uh... - Now, Mitch...

147
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,720
我们最不希望的就是让你恐慌

Um, it... Well, what... what's next?

151
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,590
我们相信他的目标是某个投票中心
We believe his target is one of the voting centers.

152
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,030
我们知道你已经安排了警卫队
We know you have soldiers in place,

153
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,680
采取了安全措施  设置了检查站
security measures and checkpoints.

154
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,370
格林局长正赶去见你
Director Green is on his way to you.

155
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,360
联调局诺克斯维尔办事处会设立指挥中心
There will be a command center out of the FBI office in Knoxville

156
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
我们将进行协调
where we will coordinate.

157
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,990
我的家人今早就在体育场投了票
My family voted at the Coliseum this morning.

158
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,250
米切  听我说
Mitch, listen to me.

159
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,510
不管你需要什么  我们都会提供
Whatever you need, we will provide.

160
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,140
俄亥俄的数字怎么样
How are the Ohio numbers?

161
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,270
投票率这么低  不好估计
It's hard to gauge with turnout this low.

162
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,620
就是要这效果
That was kind of the point.

163
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,010
是对于另一方  不是民主党
For the other side, not Democrats.

164
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,450
州长担心了  你有什么数据吗
The governor's worried. Do you have any numbers?

165
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,100
没有  只有我们给过你的
No, just what we gave you.

166
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,440
我以为总统可能有
I would think that the president might have

167
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,950
我们接触不到的数据
access to some numbers that we don't.

168
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,730
如果我有  你也会有
When I get them, you'll get them.

169
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,850
-我们很担心  -坚持住
- We're worried. - Hang in there.

170
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,520
等过了3点这一波我再跟你联系
I'll touch base with you after the three o'clock wave.

171
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,350
请让我单独待会儿  谢谢
If you could all just give me a moment, please. Thank you.

172
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,420
你最好去宴会厅
You better head over to the ballroom.

173
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,220
我们其中一人应该到场
One of us should make an appearance.

174
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,380
先生  这一天终于到了
Sir, the day has finally arrived.

175
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,700
是啊  让我们看看这一天有多长吧
Yes, and let's see just how long this day lasts.

176
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,740
想像一下国安局给我打电话问
Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me

177
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,010
穆罕默德·卡拉比的事时我有多惊讶吧
about Muhammed Kalabi just...

178
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,500
你的电话随后就到
moments before you did.

179
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,330
情况还在发展
Situation is still unfolding.

180
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,920
在选举日
On Election Day?

181
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,490
弗兰西斯
Francis...

182
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,190
跟你共事真是一段独特的经历
it's been quite a journey working with you.

183
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,600
卡拉比溜进了国内
Kalabi slipped into the country,

184
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,740
他正策划着一起针对
and he's planning a terrorist attack

185
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,490
田纳西某个投票中心的恐怖袭击
against a voting center in Tennessee.

186
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,430
这种说法太吓人了
And that is a terrifying proposition.

187
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,510
我需要你在白宫
Well, I may need you to stay around

188
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,330
再多待一阵  凯茜
the White House a bit longer, Cathy,

189
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,030
直到事态平息
until this situation is resolved.

190
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,870
好的
Of course.

191
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,490
我只是说
I was only saying...

192
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,440
这一路以来很不错了
it's been a good run.

193
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,180
说得像她能激怒我似的
As if she could ever get under my skin.

194
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,870
我现在还不用去宴会
I don't need to get to the party just yet.

195
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,820
人们伸着汗涔涔的手想要最后一次向我致敬
Sweaty palms, eager to pay me their last respects.

196
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,280
但他们真正想用的致敬方式
When what they really want to do to show their respect

197
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,120
是把所有子弹都射向我
is to empty their bullets in my body,

198
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,210
确保我死得透透的
just to make sure that I'm dead.

199
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,040
帕特  抱歉让你久等了
Patti, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

200
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,160
哈维女士刚刚告诉我
Miss Harvey was just telling me

201
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,710
日程安排有变
that there's been a change in the schedule.

202
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,310
是啊  很不幸现在出现了紧急情况
Yes, unfortunately, we're in a bit of an emergency.

203
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,910
但我希望能尽快解决
But I hope it will be resolved soon.

204
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,020
汤姆  你好
Tom, hello.

205
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,760
-你认识耶茨先生吧  -认识
- You know Mr. Yates, don't you? - Yes,

206
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,380
党代会上见过
we met at the convention.

207
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,120
莉安会在酒店
So LeAnn will be at the hotel.

208
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,810
要是你觉得
She can reach me

209
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,090
我应该早点而不是晚点过去的话  她会联系我
if you feel I need to be there sooner rather than later.

210
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,590
万一是晚点过去
In case it's later...

211
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,310
我希望你考虑一下四年后
I want you to think four years down the road.

212
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,410
-你说什么  -他们信赖你
- I'm sorry? - They trust you.

213
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,760
四年可转瞬即逝
Four years is no time.

214
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,700
有辆车在等您
We have a car waiting.

215
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,710
我们今天还握手了
So we're shaking hands today?

216
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,260
我们还是保持那样最好
I think it's best we keep it like that.

217
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,120
要握得像真格的一样
Well, shake it like you mean it.

218
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,450
这样如何
How's that?

219
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,580
你希望我直接去宴会厅吗
So you want me to just head over to the ballroom?

220
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,210
不
No.

221
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,260
不
No.

222
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,150
我确实喜欢穿过大房间看你
I do like looking at you across a large room.

223
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,700
胜利
Victory.

224
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,920
你赢的话用这份
This is for when you win.

225
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
败选演说我也写了一份
I wrote a concession speech as well.

226
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,100
全国上下的投票点都加强了安保
With increased security at polling places across the country,

227
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,560
今年进行投票的美国人
will fewer Americans vote for the president this year

228
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,790
会不会比以往都少
than in any election in recent memory?

229
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,440
尤其受关注的是典型的摇摆州
Particular attention is being paid to typical battleground states,

230
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,200
俄亥俄和宾夕法尼亚
Ohio and Pennsylvania,

231
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,590
在这些州  投票人数成了核心问题
where voter turnout has become a central issue

232
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,700
这可能决定本次历史性大选的结果
that could make all the difference in this historic election.

233
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,700
费城的投票率如果很低
You know, if turnout is low in Philadelphia...

234
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,790
安德伍德夫妇就输定了
the Underwoods are going under.

235
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,760
你得想个更好的开场白
You need a better in than that.

236
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,810
你看起像是被折腾得不轻
You look like you've been chewed up and shit out twice today.

237
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,440
似乎难以集中精力
Seems like you're having trouble focusing.

238
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,800
你看过医生吗
You ever see a doctor about that?

239
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,570
什么
What?

240
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,360
因为我自信可以诊断你是
Oh, 'cause I feel pretty comfortable diagnosing you

241
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,060
心事太重了
with too much on your fucking mind.

242
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,650
我请你喝一杯吧  我在庆祝
Let me get you something real. I'm celebrating.

243
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,370
两杯奥本威士忌
Two Oban.

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,410
庆祝什么
Celebrating what?

245
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,360
你知道汤姆·汉默施密特的长期调查组吧
You know Tom Hammerschmidt's long lead team?

246
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,170
你面前的这位是新加入的成员
You're looking at the newest member.

247
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,350
那人真是永不放弃
That guy never gives up.

248
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,670
我告诉你他想干什么  你给他提供消息
I tell you what he's up to, feed him things from you.

249
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,630
现在谈交换条件  有点晚了吧
Don't you think it's a little late for quid pro quo?

250
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,790
安德伍德夫妇仍有胜算
The Underwoods could still win.

251
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,930
等着瞧吧
We'll see.

252
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,260
无论如何  你都还有几个月
Either way, you still have a couple more months.

253
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,260
也对
Yeah.

254
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,930
我会找到地方落脚的
I'll land somewhere.

255
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,120
你的电话
Your phone.

256
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,600
今天有人能让我消停一会儿吗
Can somebody give me a second today, you know?

257
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,470
该死  失陪一下
Shit. Excuse me.

258
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,790
你好
Hello?

259
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,810

261
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,420
我们来看看直播...
Now, let's take a live look...

262

263
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,780
目前场面非常混乱

264
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,320
什么
What?

265

目前情况很复杂
...there's a lot happening right now.

266
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,570

267
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,310
试图安抚民众  并保证大家的安全
trying to keep everyone calm and safe here.

268
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,860
我们将为您带来
And we will bring you...

269
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,870
你到底去哪了
Where the hell were you?

270
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,910
田纳西  田纳西到底怎么回事

穆罕默德·卡拉比  
Muhammed Kalabi,

272
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,030
叙利亚哈里发国的  烧肖像的那个
the ICO guy from Syria who burned the effigy.

273
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,700
有什么计划
What's the plan?

274
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,730
今晚我站在你们面前  作为副总统候选人
I stand before you this evening as vice presidential candidate,

275
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,370
作为美国的第一夫人

276
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,430
最重要的  也作为这个伟大国家的一名公民
and most of all... as a citizen of this great country.

277
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,980
虽然诺克斯维尔投票中心发生了暴力事件
Despite the violent incident at the voting center in Knoxville,

278
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,160
此时此刻  总统正在进行处理
which the president is attending to as we speak,

279
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,080
我们想向任何在考虑不投票的各位保证

280
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,910
现在投票不仅是安全的  更是你们的责任

281
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,670

还是共和党人

00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,960
我们必须发声

赛斯

287

有目击者称  诺克斯维尔投票中心  
Witnesses report an FBI and Homeland presence

288
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,910
出现了联调局和国安局的人
at the Knoxville voting center.

289
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,490
你觉得这事跟哈利发国有关吗
Do you believe this is ICO-related?

290
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,520
赛斯  拜托

- And the FBI isn't talking. - Neither are you, Gina.

这可不是发布会  我并没做相关安排
This isn't a presser, because I didn't schedule one.

293

- We're just trying to find out-- - That's two, Gina.

所有人都清楚了吗  谢谢
Is everyone clear? Thank you.

300
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,520
赛斯
Seth!

301
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,840
我听说一切都乱套了
I'm told everything just went wrong.

302
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,410
-联调局派了拆弹部队的人  -但是  米切
- The FBI had the bomb guys there... - But, Mitch...

303
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,130
天啊
...for crying out loud!

304
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,620
伤情仅仅是擦伤和瘀伤
...injuries didn't go beyond scrapes and bruises.

305
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,170
这我可不确定  肖娜
Oh, I don't know about that, Shawna.

306
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,860
有12人被送往了医院
Twelve people were taken to the hospital.

307
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,380
格林的预计到达时间有了吗
Look, is there any status on Green's ETA?

308
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,660
-斯图尔特州务卿和我  -好的  请稍等
- Secretary Stewart and I... - Yes. Just a moment, sir.

309
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,810
-无法做出决断  除非  -您得接这通电话
- ...cannot make a determination without-- - You need to take this.

310
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,710
什么  什么
What? What?

311
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,100
又怎么了
What the hell is this?

312
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,320
你好
Hello.

313
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,250
州长  我是马克·厄舍
Governor. Mark Usher here.

314
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,780
我们应该在太阳谷的会议上见过
I think we met at the conference in Sun Valley.

315
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,010
对  没错
Yes, that's right.

316
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,750
真希望能在更好的情况下打来
Well, I wish I were calling under better circumstances.

317
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,990
我想知道您有什么需求
I wanted to know what you're going to need.

318
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,430
我可以尽快安排人过去  以防您...
I can get some excellent people down there fast in case you...

319
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,800
您似乎需要额外的安保  或者
you're feeling like you need the extra security or...

320
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
您还在听吗
You there?

321
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,680
在  我在
I'm right here, yeah.

322
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,150
几分钟前我跟肖娜谈过了
I spoke to Shawna a few minutes ago,

323
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,480
我们一致认为绝不能让选举受影响
and we agreed that we absolutely cannot disrupt this election.

324
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,590
你联系了我的州务卿
You called my secretary of state?

325
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,590
是她联系了我
Well, she called me.

326
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,310
她是田纳西州党领袖  跟你一样
She is a leader of the party in Tennessee. As are you.

327
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,960
需要我提醒你  先生  你那儿是共和党州
Do I need to remind you, sir, that yours is a red state,

328
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,770
共和党人都指望着你呢吗
and every Republican in it is counting on you?

329
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,150
-谢谢  厄舍先生  -等一下
- Thank you, Mr. Usher. - Now, hold on.

330
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,910
肖娜只想问
Shawna just wanted to ask

331
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,400
能做什么  做不了什么
what can be done and what can't be done.

332
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,510
她跟我们其他人一样  也在想办法
She's like the rest of us, trying to figure this thing out.

333
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,260
因为目前尚无法确定的
Because of the scale of a possible threat

334
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,380
潜在威胁的规模
which we're still trying to determine,

335
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,920
也因为这些投票中心的重要性
and because of the importance of these, uh, voting centers,

336
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,800
我们请求州长宣布
we're asking the governor to declare

337
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,420
-进入紧急状态  -威尔  你坐会儿吧
- a state of emergency... - Will, could you please sit?

338
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,910
这样我们才能...
...so that we can provide more...

339
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,280
我不喜欢这样
I don't like it.

340
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,180
3点那波说田纳西无论如何都是我们的了
Three o'clock wave said Tennessee's locked up, no matter what.

341
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,250
...发生在这里的事件
...into the event that took place here...

342
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,430
亲爱的  大家都看不到了
Love, no one can see.

343
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,110
怎么回事
What the hell?

344
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,000
可能会让人不安
...be potentially disturbing.

345
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,840
有炸弹时狗不会叫的
They don't bark when there's a bomb.

346
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,180
什么意思"不会叫"
What do you mean, "They don't bark"?

347
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,410
有炸弹时狗不会叫  总统先生
The canine units don't bark when there's a bomb, Mr. President.

348
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,410
嗯  但整栋楼的人都听到了
Yeah, but the whole building heard it.

349
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,920
他们的训练是检测到炸弹就坐下
They're trained to sit down when they detect a bomb.

350
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,990
-它们坐下了吗  -没有
- So did they sit down? - No.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,440
那就是没炸弹
Then there was no bomb.

352
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,270
我们认为狗叫是因为受到了刺激
We think the barking was provoked.

353
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,140
刺激  格林局长  这真是够了
Provoked? Director Green, that'll be enough.

354
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,770
这些狗是我们最后的防线  先生
These dogs are our last line of defense, sir.

355
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,010
我觉得哈里发国今天闯进去了
I think ICO got in there today.

356
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,020
幸好他们没引爆炸弹
And thank God they didn't get a bomb off,

357
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,580
但不管他们让什么人混了进去
but whatever operative they got in there,

358
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,150
我觉得是去引发暴乱的
I think, was used to provoke the riot.

359
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,260
我说够了
I said that is enough.

360
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,900
你觉得哈里发国会闯进楼里
You think ICO got all the way in that building

361
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,790
然后又决定还是不引爆炸弹了吗
and then just decided not to set off a bomb?

362
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,240
-这个...  -我们不能影响投票
- Well, there are-- - We are not going to disrupt the voting.

363
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,120
米切  你好好劝劝他
Mitch, would you please talk some sense into him?

364
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,630
-我  -如果不暂停投票
- I-- - If we don't suspend,

365
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,480
局里无法确保中心的安全
the Bureau cannot guarantee the safety of these centers.

366
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,810
不可接受  找到卡拉比
Unacceptable. Find Kalabi.

367
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,080
州长不会希望
The governor does not wanna

368
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,630
在这么晚的时候颁发宵禁令
have to institute a curfew this late in the game.

369
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,080
-米切  -是  先生
- And, Mitch... - Uh, yes, sir.

370
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,840
你不能关闭投票
...you are not closing the polls.

371
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,350
你觉得我们该关吗
You think we should?

372
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,070
我没法发表意见
I can't weigh in on this.

373
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,910
我得跟肖娜谈谈
I need to talk to Shawna.

374
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,910
公众还要承受多少丑闻
How many scandals should the public be expected to endure

375
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,710
才会说"够了"
before they say, "Enough"?

376
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,950
会说"我不出门了"
Before they say, "I'm staying home"?

377
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,360
会对国家完全丧失信心
Before they lose complete faith in this democratic republic?

378
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,670
上次出现这样的趋势
This is a trend that dates back at least

379
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,870
是尼克松躲过牢狱之灾的时候
to when Nixon avoided jail time.

380
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,710
好了  结束
Okay, we're out.

381
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,900
-真不错  -我不需要粉丝  肖恩
- You're good. - I don't need fans, Sean.

382
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,890
只是真诚的欣赏
Just genuine appreciation.

383
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,170
喝一杯吗  一杯是酒  一杯不是
Would you like a drink? One is brown and one is not.

384
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,590
-今晚会很漫长  -我听说不是
- It's gonna be a long night. - That's not what I hear.

385
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,580
那么  田纳西
So, Tennessee...

386
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,710
是问题所在
Is the question.

387
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,710
怎么样
And?

388
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,160
我的男伴什么都不知道
My date knew nothing.

389
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,750
你在到处问了吗
Are you making the rounds?

390
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,790
这里的人比我一般接触的年龄要大
Crowd's a little older than I'm used to, but...

391
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,110
但是  没错  他们话多  却没什么料
yes, they're a talkative bunch... that don't say much.

392
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,570
我要酒
I'll take the brown one.

393
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,860
那是帕特里夏·惠特克  民主党全国委员会主席
That's Patricia Whittaker over there. Chairperson of the DNC.

394
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,370
她有次在奥马哈一家酒吧里扇了我个耳光
She slapped me once in a bar in Omaha.

395
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,900
我也不知道为什么
For the life of me, I can't tell you why.

396
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,750
田纳西州有问题
There's something wrong with Tennessee.

397
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,100
你的男伴要么在撒谎  要么在抵赖
Your date is either lying or denying.

398
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,640
这是什么意思
What did you mean by this?

399
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,400
演讲背后的字
On the back of the speech?

400
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,390
没事  别提了
Nothing. Forget it.

401
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,120
"还有时间"
"There's still time"?

402
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,770
还有时间做什么
There's still time for what?

403
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,350
你在干什么
What are you doing?

404
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,140
你和你丈夫
You and your husband.

405
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,170
准备赢得选举
Getting ready to win an election.

406
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,180
我看到你的样子了
I see the way you're acting.

407
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,330
你知道我们今天打算赢得选举吗
Do you realize we have every intention of winning today?

408
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,370
当然
Sure.

409
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,770
但然后呢
But then what?

410
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,460
我以前会去缅因州的一间小木屋
I used to go to this cabin... up in Maine.

411
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,030
窗户关不严实
The windows don't close properly.

412
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,610
整个夏天都能闻到大海的气味儿
You can smell the ocean all summer long.

413
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,990
我觉得你还是去宴会厅吧
I do think it's better you go to the ballroom.

414
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,000
如果你尚未投票  我保证  你会有机会的
If you have not voted, I assure you, you will get the chance.

415
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,640
但出于良心
But I cannot, in good conscience,

416
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,280
我不能在确保安全前  允许投票继续
allow balloting to continue until I am satisfied that it is safe.

417
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,840
为此  随着夜晚将至
To that end, as nightfall approaches,

418
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,790
我要宣布今晚
I am announcing an enforced,

419
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,090
执行全州宵禁
state-wide curfew, effective tonight.

420
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,250
如果你中部时间晚8点30还未回家
If you are not in your home by 8:30 p.m. central time,

421
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,920
或是东部时间9点30
or by 9:30 in the eastern parts of this state,

422
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,180
你将被拘禁甚至逮捕
you will be subject to detention and possible arrest.

423
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,690
这是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

424
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,450
我们会赢下宾州和俄亥俄州  就这么回事
What's going on is we're gonna win Pennsylvania and Ohio.

425
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,450
那么你就超过270了
That puts you over 270.

426
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,400
投票还在继续  大家还在投票
The polls are still open. People are still voting.

427
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,930
我的直觉是那些票属于我们
My gut says they're ours.

428
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,520
没有田纳西也272了
That's 272 without Tennessee.

429
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,360
那混蛋暂停了投票
That asshole's suspending the vote.

430
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,960
那得由他的州务卿决定  她是我们的人
That's up to his secretary of state, and she's on our side.

431
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,210
-都这样了她还有的选吗  -州长  听我说
- She's gonna have a choice after this? - Governor, listen to me.

432
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,480
我们还要让弗兰西斯·安德伍德
I mean, how long do we let Francis Underwood

433
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,790
耍这种手段多久啊
get away with this kind of shit? Huh? How long?

434
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,350
他不会得逞的
He won't get away with it.

435
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,310
不会的
He won't.

436
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,380
刚刚是田纳西州长
That was Tennessee governor...

437
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,100
相信我
Trust me.

438
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,020
宣布全州宵禁
...announcing a state-wide curfew.

439
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,670
扯淡
Bullshit.

440
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,860
全州的投票中心都在关闭
Voting centers all across the state are being shut down,

441
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,250
中部时间8点30或东部时间9点30前
and anyone not in their homes 8:30 central time,

442
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,490
还没回家的人
or 9:30...

443
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,090
费城5点的一波  我们应该赢定了
Five o'clock wave from Philly. I think we're home.

444
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,880
...被拘禁甚至逮捕  这则公告...
...detention and possible arrest. This announcement...

445
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,200
田纳西的事简直疯了
That Tennessee shit is crazy.

446
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,290
疯狂事经常有
Crazy shit happens all the time.

447
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,060
这么凑巧
This convenient?

448
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,240
少来什么阴谋论了
Spare me the conspiracy talk.

449
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,910
政府没那么大威力  或能力
The government's not that powerful... or competent.

450
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,490
总得问问
A man can ask.

451
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,220
目前安德伍德255  康威245
We're looking at 255 Underwood, 245 Conway.

452
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,690
宾州和俄亥俄呢
Pennsylvania and Ohio?

453
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,130
还是太接近  但就要6点了
Still too close, but it's almost six o' clock.

454
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,280
等我们把田纳西州从康威变成摇摆
When we change Tennessee from Conway to undecided--

455
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,930
那么康威会下跌
That brings Conway down

456
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,810
-到...  -234  还是太接近
- to-- - Two thirty-four. Still way too close.

457
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,850
是啊  我们尚不知道
Yes, but we don't yet know

458
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,330
他已经拿下了西部州
that he's locked in the western states.

459
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,250
那些州十年没变了
Those states have been locked up for ten years.

460
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,760
红的  红的  红的  到今晚结束又会是红的
Red, red, red and they'll be red again by the end of the night.

461
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,780
就看宾州和俄亥俄了
It's gonna come down to Pennsylvania and Ohio.

462
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,390
康威需要两个州  你只需要一个
Conway needs both. You only need one.

463
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,110
马修斯
Matthews?

464
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,340
他会反抗  可能还会公开表态
He'll push back. He might even go public.

465
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,650
另外五个州呢
What about the other five states in play?

466
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,600
律师在候着
The lawyers are waiting.

467
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,120
我们可以就压制投票提出诉讼  但是
We can generate lawsuits, argue suppression, but...

468
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,350
还是不够
Still not enough.

469
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,630
奥姆斯泰德在俄亥俄情况不乐观  他很不高兴
Olmstead's losing in Ohio, and he's not taking it well.

470
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,560
我今早跟他的幕僚长塔妮娅通过话
I spoke with his chief of staff, Tanya, this morning.

471
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,460
他在州北的情况很糟
He's getting clobbered in the northern part of the state.

472
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,890
克利夫兰的低投票率也是个问题
Low turnout in Cleveland's not helping.

473
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,330
但他还能扭转局势
But he could still pull it out.

474
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,160
他赢不了的  他也清楚
He's not going to win and he knows it.

475
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,670
我们还有多少时间
How much time do we have?

476
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,430
俄亥俄州两小时后关闭  大部分人今早都投票了
Ohio closes in two hours. And most people voted this morning.

477
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,710
有些州局势已定了
Some of these states are baked in already.

478
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,100
克莱尔和我要单独谈谈
Claire and I need the room for a moment.

479
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,510
是  先生
Yes, sir.

480
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,000
-莉安  我们再联络你  -是  先生
- LeAnn, we'll call you back. - Yes, sir.

481
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,030
你为什么让他出去
Why did you ask him to leave?

482
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,060
因为我想再看着你的眼睛一次
Because I just wanted to look in your eyes one more time

483
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,840
再决定要不要动手
before we do this.

484
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,040
弗兰西斯
Francis...

485
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,040
我们做吧
we're doing this.

486
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,060
他救不了我们  他发明了任期限制
He can't save us. He invented term limits.

487
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,420
道格
Doug!

488
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,020
再给我接莉安·哈维
Get me LeAnn Harvey back on the phone.

489
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,190
是  先生
Yes, sir.

490
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,170
对俄亥俄做该做的吧
Do what you have to do with Ohio.

491
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,080
我就去
I'm on it.

492
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,220
莉安  让律师准备
LeAnn, get the lawyers ready.

493
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,200
-我不能这么做  -你可以的
- I can't do this. - Yes, you can.

494
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,360
-不不  -而且得马上完成
- No, no, no, no, no! - And it needs to be done quickly.

495
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,340
太草率了
It's too sloppy.

496
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,080
是莉安打的电话  为什么是你来
Why are you here if LeAnn called me?

497
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,330
我还要向你解释
Do I really have to explain to you

498
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,900
你不这么做的后果吗
what will happen if you don't do this?

499
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,730
我不在乎他输不输
I don't care if he loses.

500
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,320
我不是指选举  我是说你
I'm not talking about the election. I'm talking about you.

501
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,780
你会怎么样
What will happen to you?

502
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,480
你有你需要的一切了  链接已经发给你了
You have everything you need. The Pastebin link was sent to you.

503
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,600
莉安呢
Where's LeAnn?

504
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,700
她不在  我时间不多了
She's not here, and I'm short on time.

505
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,600
州长  对不起  但这事只有一个办法
Governor, I'm sorry, but there's only one way to play this.

506
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,920
我们需要你撤掉那三郡的
We need you to pull your poll workers

507
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,420
投票工作人员和投票机
and your machines from those three counties.

508
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,710
共和党人会宰了我的  那是他们的地盘
The Republicans would crucify me. They own that area.

509
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,760
但那几个选区
But those are the precincts

510
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,970
最有可能遭遇威胁
that are most likely to be threatened.

511
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,350
"可能"  你什么...
"Likely to be"? Hey, what are you...

512
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,870
这是什么意思
What are we talking about here?

513
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,640
恐怖袭击可能性
Terrorist chatter.

514
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,090
针对田纳西州的
Related to Tennessee?

515
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,190
是的
Yes, sir.

516
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,810
我可不能光听你空口一词
Well, I'm gonna need more than your word on that.

517
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,490
对不起  但情报是机密  州长
Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence is classified, Governor.

518
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,060
那给我权限
Then read me in.

519
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:56,960
我没亲眼
'Cause I'm not doing this

520
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,010
看到证据是不会这么做的
without seeing tangible proof with my own eyes.

521
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,170
你去告诉弗兰西斯吧
You can tell Francis.

522
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,980
另外  因为俄亥俄州投票率这么低
The other thing is, with Ohio turnout so low,

523
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,940
可能会有人指控你刻意压制投票
people could accuse you of engaging in voter suppression.

524
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,860
什么
What?

525
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,640
投票中心和警卫队都是总统的主意
The voting centers and the troops were the president's idea.

526
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,160
但你同意了
But you signed on to them,

527
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,760
这才重要
and that's what matters.

528
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,650
你要输掉选举了  先生
You're losing your election, sir.

529
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,960
这很明显
The signs are clear.

530
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,030
民主党失去一位州长就太可惜了
That'd be a real shame for the Democrats to be down a governor.

531
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,720
但现在发生了种种情况
But here we have this confluence of events.

532
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,010
一方面是你不尽如人意的选情
Your disappointing returns on one hand

533
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,670
一方面是恐怖袭击的可能
and the chatter on the other.

534
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,810
我需要证据  否则  人们会觉得
I need proof. Otherwise, people will think--

535
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,680
你为了赢得选举  而关闭了
That you shut down voting in Republican precincts

536
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,600
共和党选区的投票站
to guarantee your own win.

537
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,880
幸好
Now I'd say it's a good thing

538
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,480
国安局刚收到了可靠的消息
that the NSA just picked up on some credible chatter.

539
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,380
这危险的世界让你别无选择
This dangerous world left you no choice.

540
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,640
谢谢
Thank you.

541
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,480
州长  我刚刚拿到了机密情报
Governor, I was just handed the classified intel.

542
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,910
您在加密服务器上吗
Are you on a secure server?

543
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,130
-在  -请稍等
- Yes, I am. - Please hold.

544
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,930
我这就把文件发给您
I'm sending the files over right now.

545
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,840
您的决定是正确的  先生
You're doing the right thing, sir.

546
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,700
我们可不能背上血债
We don't want blood on our hands.

547
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,760
我不管他们把投票机搬哪去
I don't care where they're taking the voting machines.

548
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,710
你就盯紧...
Just stay...

549
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,210
有必要的话把你自己绑在投票机上
You chain yourself to one of them if you have to.

550
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,900
好  我去找个俄亥俄州的法官
Good. I'm gonna find an Ohio judge.

551
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,210
俄亥俄州的投票中心已经关了近两个小时了
Voting centers in Ohio have been closed for almost two hours.

552
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,410
康威已经去找法官了
And Conway's got a judge.

553
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,790
他在申请重开投票中心
He's petitioning to reopen.

554
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,400
但就算投票中心继续关闭
But even if they stay closed,

555
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,650
俄亥俄州能帮我们达成目的吗
would Ohio get us there?

556
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,370
其他州可能还有戏
Other states might be in play.

557
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,720
压制投票的传言也出现了  但...
Rumblings of suppression are out there, although...

558
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,760
还有什么别的情况
Well, what else do we have?

559
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,400
爱达荷州  出现恐吓选民的事件
Voter intimidation in Idaho.

560
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,850
怎么样  我要不要回话让他们提交诉讼
What do you think? Should I call them back and have them file?

561
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,890
我看行
I like it.

562
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,900
这样和田纳西的事呼应效果最好
It has the most resonance with what's happened in Tennessee.

563
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,480
我还希望佐治亚有议员站出来
I also like an assemblyman we have in Georgia.

564
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,820
马里兰有个众议员
There's a congressman in Maryland.

565
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,240
马里兰也是没要求派警卫队的州之一
That's one of the states that didn't request the troops.

566
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,400
等等  我们需不需要普通选民出来表态
But wait. Don't we need something coming from a voter?

567
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,960
密西西比有个选民
There's a voter in Mississippi.

568
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,720
她说她吓得不敢去投票了
Said she was too scared to vote.

569
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,880
新闻基本就是告诉她不要去投票
That TV essentially told her not to go.

570
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
这就有点牵强了吧
Well, that sounds like a bit of a stretch.

571
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,220
可能对我们有利  先生
That could be a plus for us, sir.

572
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,730
能很好地打开局面
Really open things up.

573
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,420
如果俄亥俄继续关闭
If Ohio stays shut,

574
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,890
可能会引发连锁反应
there could be a ripple effect.

575
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,970
这都是前无古人的做法
This is all uncharted territory.

576
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,110
那好  佐治亚和马里兰待会儿再说
All right, let's put a pin in Georgia and Maryland,

577
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,650
让俄亥俄的投票中心继续关闭
and let's keep the Ohio voting centers shut down,

578
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,340
看看有什么结果
and see where that gets us.

579
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,070
康威已经拿下宾夕法尼亚
Pennsylvania has gone to Conway.

580
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,240
就算双方在俄亥俄仍然难分胜负
Even if Ohio is still too close to call

581
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,770
总统在西北部取胜的话
and the President does well in the Northwest,

582
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,750
他仍无法抵消康威在南部取得的优势
he can't counter Conway's gains in the South,

583
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,260
而那里曾是安德伍德的地盘
in what would typically be Underwood territory.

584
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,020
人民已经做出了选择
The people have spoken.

585
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,730
真是难以置信
I can't believe this.

586
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,240
总统因故不能前来  他向各位表示歉意
The President apologizes that he couldn't be here tonight,

587
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,350
但他想让我告诉各位  败选已经不可避免了
but he wanted me to let you know that concession is inevitable.

588
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,900
还有那么多州票没计完
All the states haven't been called yet.

589
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,560
总统还有时间想办法...
The president still has time if he needs...

590
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,010
各位  我们已经尽力了
Guys, we fought a good fight.

591
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,150
可是很不幸  实情就是这样
But, unfortunately, this is the reality of the situation.

592
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,440
天啊
Jesus.

593
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,180
看来这就算完了
Well, I guess that's that.

594
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,210
喂  我是威尔
Yeah, this is Will.

595
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,000
我想第一个对你说
I wanted to be the first to tell you

596
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,190
恭喜你  当选总统先生
congratulations, Mr. President-elect.

597
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
谢谢你  总统先生
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

598
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,030
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}2000年大选夜  戈尔先向小布什认输
但是第二天又反悔了

599
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,030
怎么  你以为我没从戈尔那里学到教训吗
What? You think I learned nothing from Al Gore?

600
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,220
我们这场选战可真是激烈万分啊  是不是
We kept them on the edge of their seats, didn't we?

601
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,260
我想这也说明我们的体制运转良好
I guess that means the system is working.

602
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,790
我也这么看
I guess it does.

603
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,120
你是我遇到过的最强劲的对手了  弗兰西斯
You're about as tough an opponent as they come, Francis.

604
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,060
我经验丰富啊
Well, I've had a lot of practice.

605
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,050
请一定要转达我对汉娜和孩子们的问候
Now, you be sure to give my regards to Hannah and the children.

606
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,880
谢谢你  总统先生  我
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm...

607
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,680
我在不久的将来  肯定会向你讨教的
sure I'll be calling on you for advice in the very near future.

608
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,540
我万分期待
Well, I look forward to that.

609
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,720
他认输了
He conceded?

610
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,360
对
Yeah.

611
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,270
我们成功了
We did it.

612
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,430
我们做到了
We did it.

613
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,640
打扰一下  先生
Excuse me, sir.

614
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,770
布洛哈特将军正在来套房的路上
General Brockhart is on his way over to the suite.

615
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,780
谢谢
Thank you.

616
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,940
有消息源称  不久前
Sources are telling us that Francis Underwood

617
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,180
弗兰西斯·安德伍德致电康威州长
conceded to Governor Conway on the phone

618
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,980
承认落选
only a short time ago.

619
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,800
我猜测他们收到的数字跟我们的相符
I suspect their numbers are matching up with ours,

620
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,760
那么俄亥俄将被共和党收入囊中
which would put Ohio in the Republican column.

621
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,370
足以让威廉·康威
Enough to make William Conway

622
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,250
成为美国下一任总统
the next president of the United States.

623
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,370
-你好  -塔妮娅  让他接电话
- Hello? - Tanya, put him on the line.

624
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,830
等一下  我看看能不能找到他
Hang on, let me see if I can get him.

625
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,150
他是我的州务卿
He's my Secretary of State,

626
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,470
他有权这么做
and he has the power to do it.

627
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,230
那你得告诉他该做什么
Well, then you need to tell him what to do.

628
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,850
他说他可以重开选站将投票日延长到明天
He says he can reopen and extend the voting day into tomorrow.

629
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,090
告诉他这不安全
Tell him it's not safe.

630
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,160
我说了  道格
I've done that, Doug!

631
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,760
他显然不在乎
Obviously, he doesn't seem to care.

632
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,740
安德伍德已经认输了
Underwood conceded already.

633
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,180
别放你的州务卿出去
Do not trot out your Secretary of State.

634
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,400
投票不能重启
Voting cannot resume.

635
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,310
如果你还有什么疑虑
Now, if you have any doubt,

636
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,950
那也给我忍着
you swallow it right now.

637
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,040
我担心的是党派
I'm worried about the party.

638
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,270
这对党派的影响
What this could do to the party.

639
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,670
罗杰  这比党派重要多了
Roger, this is so much bigger than the party.

640
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,540
我觉得我把我的事业都赌上了
I feel like I'm risking my entire career here.

641
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,550
是的
You are.

642
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,180
如果你不照我说的做
And if you don't do what I'm telling you,

643
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,650
你的前途就完了
it's over for sure.

644
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,330
怎么了
What?

645
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,010
他还要耗多久
How many hours is it gonna take him

646
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,170
才肯在公众面前说出那几个字
to spit out the fucking words in public?

647
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,700
不管了  去他的规程
Screw this. Screw protocol.

648
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,680
我这就要过去
I'm heading down there.

649
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,190
-不  不行  -已经到第二天了  马克
- No, you're not. - It's already tomorrow, Mark.

650
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,370
这简直不可理喻
I mean, this is insane.

651
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,210
-我想发表讲话  -俄亥俄州还没完
- I want to make my speech! - Ohio is still in play.

652
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,340
什么
What?

653
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,270
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

654
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,220
持续的恐怖主义威胁带来的恐慌...
...fear from continued terrorist threats

655
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,840
和田纳西州传出的令人不安的消息
and the disturbing news coming out of Tennessee...

656
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,080
让我不得不关闭几个我们的投票站
I was forced to close a number of our polling places.

657
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,970
操
Fuck me.

658
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,870
经与俄亥俄州州务卿达成一致
And in accordance with the Ohio secretary of state,

659
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,960
投票在进一步通知前先行暂停
the vote is suspended until further notice.

660
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,210
我知道这会让我们的选民疑虑重重
Now, I know this may put our electorates in question...

661
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,290
但我别无选择
...but I had no choice.

662
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,570
新泽西可能不认证
New Jersey might not certify.

663
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,780
出现了一些异常情况
There's been a variety of irregularities.

664
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,430
伊利诺伊也是
Same with Illinois.

665
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,040
看起来内华达也有异动
Looks like Nevada's making noises, too.

666
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,230
感觉似曾相识  你有同感吗
I'm having déjà vu. You ever get that?

667
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,300
你真的在问我似曾相识的感觉吗
Are you seriously asking me about déjà vu?

668
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,170
算了  已经没感觉了
Never mind. It's gone.

669
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,590
你从未有过似曾相识的感觉吗  人人都会有
You never get déjà vu? Everybody does.

670
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,600
我没有
I don't.

671
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,810
别那么焦虑  道格
Don't look so worried, Doug.

672
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,750
你就是那一瞬间感觉很熟悉
You just felt familiar for a second.

673
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,580
已经过去了
It's over.

674
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,190
现在  总统选举结果未定
Now, the presidency hangs in the balance.

675
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,940
至少六个州将不能在2016的选举夜
At least six states will not have certified vote totals

676
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,070
认证计票结果
on Election Night 2016.

677
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,280
晚上好
Good evening.

678
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,600
我猜我该说早上好
I guess I should say good morning.

679
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,570
威尔很希望他能亲自出镜
Will wishes he could be here himself...

680
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,880
但我们获知那有违规章
but we've been advised that goes against protocol.

681
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,150
我知道...
I know...

682
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,980
你们很失望
you're disappointed.

683
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,370
你介意用失望这个词吗
Are you okay with the word disappointed?

684
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,460
我们不该提到他们的愤怒吗
Shouldn't we acknowledge their outrage?

685
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,240
我觉得我们应该小心处理
I'd say we should tread lightly.

686
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,780
目前我们只想请他们保持耐心
For now, we're just asking for their patience.

687
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,610
好  我们拍吧
Okay, let's do it.

688
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,270
这个国家就没有无聊的时候
Never a dull moment in this country.

689
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,910
威尔很希望他能亲自出镜
Will wishes he could be here himself,

690
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,770
但我们获知那有违规章
but we've been advised that would go against protocol.

691
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,480
我知道你们很失望
I know you're disappointed

692
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,250
你们所期待的改变
that the change you were hoping for...

693
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,670
你们所投票支持的改变
...that you voted for,

694
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,790
得再等一段时间
has to wait a little longer.

695
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,390
最终  这没有定论的选举之夜
And, finally, a night of electoral indecision,

696
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,070
几乎每个州都提起了诉讼
with lawsuits being filed in nearly every state,

697
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,150
为它画上句号的是檀香山市长
has ended with the mayor of Honolulu,

698
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,410
最后一个关闭了投票
in the last state to close its polls,

699
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,090
并拒绝承认选举结果
refusing to honor the results of the election

700
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,760
还提起了诉讼
and filing a lawsuit.

701
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,250
夏威夷是我们这边的吗
Was Hawaii one of ours?

702
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,100
应该不是
No, I don't think so.

703
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,840
克莱尔  能帮我个忙吗
Claire, could you do me a little favor?

704
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,680
我头很痛
I have a splitting headache.

705
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,380
你能揉揉我的太阳穴吗
Could you rub my temples for a moment?

706
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,420
当然
Of course.

707
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,430
不  其实是我眼睛这里疼
No, actually the pain is right behind my eyes.

708
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,250
你能...给我揉揉眼睛吗
Could you just... rub my eyes for me?

709
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,520
但是你讨厌那样
But you hate that.

710
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,630
我知道  但是这次我应该会喜欢
I know, but I think I'll like it this time.

711
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,640
你可以用力点
You can do it harder.

712
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,560
再用力点
Even harder than that.

713
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,300
走出这一步就没有回头路了
There's no coming back from this.

714
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,640
我很清楚我们要做什么
I know exactly what we're about to do.

715
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,920
如果我们失败了  后果要我们两个承担
If we fail, it's on both of us.

716
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,900
我是不能保护你的
I won't be able to protect you.

717
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,860
那就如释重负了
And what a relief that will be...

718
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,530
对我们两个都是
for both of us.

719
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,320
美国人民不知道什么对他们才是最好的
The American people don't know what's best for them.

720
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,100
我知道
I do.

721
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,300
我很清楚他们需要什么
I know exactly what they need.

722
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,420
他们就像小孩子  克莱尔
They're like little children, Claire.

723
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,030
我们从未有过的孩子
Children we never had.

724
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,360
我们得抓着他们黏糊糊的手指
We have to hold their sticky fingers

725
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,920
擦干净他们的脏嘴
and wipe their filthy mouths.

726
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,300
教他们分辨是非
Teach them right from wrong.

727
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,360
告诉他们思考什么
Tell them what to think

728
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,370
感觉什么  想要什么
and how to feel and what to want.

729
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,580
他们甚至连书写最疯狂的梦想
They even need help writing their wildest dreams,

730
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,230
塑造最大的恐惧都需要帮助
crafting their worst fears.

731
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,300
他们很幸运
Lucky for them...

732
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,230
他们有我...
they have me...

733
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,590
他们有你
they have you.

734
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,420
安德伍德
Underwood.

735
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,070
安德伍德
Underwood.

736
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,580
2016年
2016.

737
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,610
2020年
2020.

738
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,800
2024年
2024.

739
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,170
2028年
2028.

740
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,500

741
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,740
2036年
2036.

742
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,930
一个国家
One nation...

{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}按约定俗成的规则  正常的选举程序  是在选举结果揭晓后
落败方向胜选方打电话认输  然后发表落选演说  再由胜选方宣布胜利
竞选双方在这件事上  按说要本着"大局为重"的原则
就是不能让胜负的结果影响选民对民主制度的信任
所以如果选举中出现选票极其接近的情况  而落后方要求重新计票
落后方会面临压力  不能让这个悬而未决的时间拖得太久  造成混乱
但如果有候选人想纠缠下去  拖上几个月  也并不被法律禁止
在2016年大选夜  希拉里开始并不甘心认输
是奥巴马亲自给她打电话  要求她认输  她才给特朗普打电话承认落选
但她并没去自己的选举中心会场公开认输  并感谢支持者
而是在午夜后派自己的竞选经理去会场  告知支持者事情还没完
媒体是在她不会亲临现场后  才得知她致电特朗普认输了  当时场面混乱

{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}美国建国时并没有任期限制  但是首任总统华盛顿高风亮节
担任两届总统后就坚决退休  所以后来者也就约定俗成地只任两届
格罗弗·克利夫兰是美国唯一一个卸任后重选再度当选的总统
他是第22任和第24任总统  都只任了一届
但到了富兰克林·罗斯福的时候  因为他影响很大  又遇上二战
所以当他两届任期结束后决定继续做总统时  并没有遇到太多阻力
他的支持者称  他继续担任总统是为了战争需要
罗斯福四次胜选  但是最后一次被选上后不久就因病去世
他的行为被认为是对民主制度的威胁
于是国会在1944年通过了宪法第22条修正案  规定总统最多只能任两届
在副总统中途继位的情况下  也最多只能担任10年
