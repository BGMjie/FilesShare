我真为她骄傲  这是她应得的

现在你得全天候随身带着这个了
You have to now carry this with you at all times.

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,730
-密码吗  -没错  法律规定的
- The codes? - Mmm- hmm. It's the law.

州长  我们刚刚听说
Governor, we just got word

41
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,830
副总统克莱尔·安德伍德
that Vice President Claire Underwood

42
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,560
已宣誓就任代总统
was sworn in as acting president.

43
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,680
您知道吗
Were you aware?

44
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,550
我当然知道

您有什么评论吗
Do you have any comment?

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,460
上帝保佑美国
God bless America.

47
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,190
如果众议院周一的投票选了您
If Monday's House vote goes your way,

48
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,160
-您成功当选的话  -我会赢的  相信我
- and you win the presidency... - Oh, I'll win, believe me.

49
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,570
您觉得这第三次投票能让您当选
You think this vote will be the charm?

50
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,270
国会和全国人民心情是一样的
See, Congress is no different than the rest of the country.

51
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,550
人民厌倦了这种政坛乱局和纷争

公众非常不满
The public is not happy.

53
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,890

54
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,360
克莱尔·安德伍德还会继续担任副总统吗
would Claire Underwood remain as vice president?

55
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,750
如果她为国家大局着想的话  就不会
Not if she wants what's best for the country.

56
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,730
可是第十二修正案有明文规定  你有的选吗
But given the Twelfth Amendment, would you have a choice?

57
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,960
大家就问到这里吧

58
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,510

拉斯姆森也改立场了
And Rasmussen changed his vote.

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,450
他一直想找机会报复我
Well, he's been waiting a long time to pay me back.

64
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,000
在罗德岛搞出个僵局好让他博得关注
Creating a deadlock in Rhode Island just gives him the spotlight.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,570
-可以说服他  -会议定在今天下午

66
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,740
可如果说服不了他  我们就失去罗德岛了
Yes, but if we can't, we lose Rhode Island.

67
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,330
他似乎是一个人  但也可能有别人支持他
He seems to be acting alone, but that could change.

68
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,560
这个周末我们会取得进展的
We will make gains this weekend.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,750
在周一投票前稳住局面
Shore things up by Monday's vote.

70
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:03,910
总统先生
Mr. President,

71
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,070
我们可能需要考虑另一种选项
it's possible we may need to consider the other option.

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,140
改期重新大选
A rescheduled election.

73
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,240
不  我会让拉斯姆森乖乖的
No, no, I'll get Rasmussen back in line,

74
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,280
顺便再多拉几票过来
and turn some others along the way.

75
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,270
我们已经为你和总统女士安排了
We've arranged sit-downs for you and Madam President

76

和各小州议员的会面

77

78
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,210
三栋众议院办公楼逐门拜访
Longworth and Cannon.

79
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,920
除了白宫  我最喜欢这三栋楼了
Three of my favorite buildings after this one.

80
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,760
什么事
What is it?

81
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,620
南极洲麦克默多研究站
The McMurdo Research Facility in Antarctica.

82
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,520
所有实时通讯渠道都中断下线了
All live feed communications have ceased or been disconnected.

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,150
不过我们收到了一名驻站的
However, we have been receiving texts and e-mails

84
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,940
美国科考人员的短信和电邮
from an American scientist stationed there,

85
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,210
说有身份不明的
claiming that an unidentified

86
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,770
武装人员实施了登陆占领
occupying military force has landed.

87
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,660
你认为这些士兵是俄军吗
You think the soldiers are Russian?

88
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,560
他这么认为
He thinks so.

89
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,560
他们乘坐的是无标记的科考船
They arrived via unmarked research vessels.

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,690
我们联系了莫斯科
We reached out to Moscow,

91
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,180
但他们否认与此事有任何官方联系
but they're denying any official involvement.

92
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,330
想不到啊
Surprise, surprise.

93
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,020
这就是悍然入侵
It's a brazen act of aggression.

94
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,200
他这是心存侥幸
Well, it's a crime of opportunity.

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,310
佩特罗夫认为美国政府现在无暇他顾
Petrov thinks the US government has their eye off the ball.

96
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,030
他想错了
Well, it doesn't.

97
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,140
凯茜  我们收到的最近一次通讯是什么
Cathy, what's the most recent communication we've received?

98
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,050
我是说  由不明力量发起的
What I'm saying is this aggression in Antarctica,

99
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,240
对南极洲的入侵
by powers unknown,

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,910
正是总统之位一事
is a direct result of the uncertainty

101
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,950
迟迟不得以解决造成的直接恶果
that our presidential situation has wrought.

102
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,250
沃茨众议员  国会黑人党团什么时候
Congressman Watts, since when is Antarctica a concern

103
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,300
开始这么关心南极洲的事了
for the Congressional Black Caucus?

104
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,410
我希望你不是在暗示
I hope you're not implying that the caucus

105
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,940
黑人党团无权就国际事务发表意见
shouldn't have a voice in international affairs.

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,520
我希望你不是这个意思  谢谢你  兰迪
I hope that's not what I'm hearing. Thank you, Randy.

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,800
我将于明天
I've called a meeting tomorrow,

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,220
召集国会黑人党团开会  在周一总统投票前
for the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss our positions,

109
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,920
讨论本党团在国内外各项议题上的立场
both foreign and domestic, before Monday's presidential vote.

110
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,360
您是在考虑转而支持康威吗
Are you considering shifting your support to Conway?

111
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,970
我现在只能说
Well, all I can say at this time,

112
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,150
最重要的是团结
that the most important thing is unity...

113
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,480
以及民众对民主制度的信心
and the public's faith in the institution of democracy.

114
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,400
就这样
That's all for now.

115
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,050
你违反了《南极条约体系》
You are in violation of the Antarctic Treaty System.

116
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,320
那是苏联1959年签订的条约
A treaty the USSR signed in 1959.

117
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,590
我们已经是个新国家了
We're a new country.

118
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,790
所以你承认了那是你的军队
So you're admitting they are your troops.

119
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,570
我只是说我需要
I'm simply stating I need to

120
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,330
解释一下由苏联签订的协议
interpret agreements signed by the Soviet Union.

121
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,930
那么
In which case,

122
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,860
你就是否定了几十年来的裁军进程
you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress.

123
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,040
冷战已经结束了  代总统女士
The Cold War is over, Mrs. Acting President.

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,730
那我们也许需要重新修订条约
Well, then maybe we need to revisit the treaty.

125
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,730
我对那不感兴趣
I'm not interested in revisiting a treaty.

126
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,010
我只关心继续执政
I'm interested in staying in power.

127
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,490
克莱尔
And, Claire...

128
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,440
如果我能这样称呼你的话
if I could be so familiar.

129
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,250
在我的国家
In my country...

130
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,730
一旦你上了台  就不会放权
once you're in office, you don't let go.

131
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,990
-维克多  -总统先生
- Viktor. - Mr. President.

132
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,190
你们美国人现在的总统可真不少
You Americans certainly have a lot of presidents these days.

133
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,990
是啊  你可能觉得我们无暇他顾
Yes, you may think that we're distracted,

134
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,740
别骗自己了
but don't fool yourself.

135
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,030
无暇他顾  不不不
Distracted? No. No, no.

136
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,350
分裂才对
Divided, yes.

137
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,130
美国的民主制度可比你
American democracy is stronger than your

138
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,310
利用这种小麻烦的可悲企图强大
sad attempt to take advantage of a bump in the road.

139
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,520
弗兰西斯  我的关注范围
Oh, Francis, my eyes are on a landscape

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,770
可远大于你们任何人的前途
that is so much bigger than any one of your roads.

141
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,590
拉斯姆森议员
Well, Congressman Rasmussen,

142
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,260
我们只是惊讶你会
we're just surprised to see you come out

143
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,540
站错边  就这样
on the wrong end of this, is all.

144
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,700
我知道那么多年前
I mean, I suppose it must've been hard

145
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,470
丢掉了众议院多数党领袖的位子
losing the House majority leadership

146
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,140
一定很不好受
all those years ago,

147
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,500
但心怀怨愤
but there is a difference

148
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,310
和背叛之间还是有区别的
between being bitter and being treasonous.

149
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,710
如果你是想要新的委员会席位
If it's new committee assignments you'd like,

150
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,310
我们完全可以安排
we can certainly arrange that.

151
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,560
已经结束了
It's over.

152
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,340
市场一落千丈
Markets are in free fall.

153
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,060
消费者信心到了历史最低点
Consumer confidence is at an all-time low.

154
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,060
这是什么  装饰品  小玩意
What is this? A doodad? A doohickey?

155
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,350
还是什么没用的奖品
A... pointless award?

156
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,020
我有说过我讨厌没用的东西吗
Did I mention I hate useless things?

157
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,700
这个国家已经在崩溃了
This nation is coming apart at the seams.

158
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,640
是因为你  因为你对这个国家做的事
Because of you, because of what you've done to this country.

159
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,370
看吧
There it is.

160
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,810
正义人士总喜欢感慨他们自己中层管理者的角色
How the righteous love to bemoan their role in middle management,

161
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,600
而谴责那些真能影响世界的人
and condemn those who actually might have an effect on the world.

162
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,060
-考虑考虑党派利益  议员  -我考虑了
- Think of the party, Congressman. - I am.

163
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,300
你觉得你来这儿能怎么样  弗兰西斯
What did you think would happen when you came in here, Francis?

164
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,050
你能威胁我
That you could threaten me,

165
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,620
告诉我不合作的话  全国委员会下一轮选举
tell me the DNC'll throw money at my primary opponent next cycle

166
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,010
就把钱投给我的劲敌
if I don't play ball?

167
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,160
还是说你打算奉承我
Or were you gonna flatter me?

168
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,680
一会儿说我是"党内长老"
"Elder of the party" this,

169
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,490
一会儿说我是"资深成员领头羊"
"bellwether senior member" that.

170
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,010
我真有点高兴
You know, I'm somewhat delighted

171
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,150
你到了这把年纪还能发展出点个性
that you developed a personality at this late date.

172
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,240
但我希望你再想想
But I would ask you to rethink this.

173
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
在你职业生涯的晚期闹这样的事情
To come out this way on this thing in the twilight of your career

174
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,140
只会给你的维基百科添一笔污点
will do nothing but sully your Wikipedia page.

175
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,560
你根本不明白  是吧
You have no idea, do you?

176
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,230
你在这里没有分量了
No one hears you walking the halls of this building...

177
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,280
现在没有了
not anymore.

178
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,890
-你在帮谁做事  -什么
- Who are you working for? - Excuse me?

179
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,460
我跟你这个软骨头共事了二十年
I served next to your jellied spine for two decades.

180
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,910
你从没表现出过一点勇气
You've never shown an ounce of courage.

181
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,550
你没有复仇的本事
You don't have what it takes for revenge.

182
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,870
所以肯定有人给了你不少好处
So someone must have offered you something rather sweet.

183
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,550
好好重新考虑两小时吧
Take all of the two hours you need to reconsider.

184
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,880
还有一份需要您签字
One more thing for your signature.

185
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,610
-放在这里就可以了  -好的
- You can leave this with me. - Of course.

186
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,980
-哈维女士在等您  -请让她进来
- And Miss Harvey's waiting. - Oh, please send her in.

187
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,420
我正要回雷伯恩大楼
I'm on my way back to Rayburn.

188
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,210
请关上门
You close the door, please?

189
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,900
重新投票我们获胜的可能性有多大
What are our chances with a revote?

190
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,470
或者说  总统获胜的可能性有多大
Or, rather, what are the president's chances?

191
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,240
我想知道
I want to know.

192
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,790
就全部50个州而言  情况不太好
If it was in all 50 states, not good.

193
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,680
他的反对率还是很高  而你依然低
His unfavorables are still high. Yours are still not.

194
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,060
但他有近30年的经验  所以也不好说
But it's hard to argue with close to 30 years' experience.

195
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,330
也许总统是对的
Maybe the president is right.

196
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,350
或许他确实在众议院那里把握更大
Maybe he does have a better chance in the House.

197
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,670
别绕弯子  莉安  告诉我你怎么想的
Don't defer, LeAnn. Tell me what you think.

198
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,570
田纳西和俄亥俄的重投是他的最佳机会
The revote in Tennessee and Ohio is his best shot.

199
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,380
这对弗兰克来说是最佳
While it's what's best for Frank,

200
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,500
可未必对你来说最佳
it may not be what's best for you.

201
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,100
谢谢你
Thank you.

202
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,430
你似乎是个通情达理的人
You seem like a reasonable man.

203
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,760
我懂得倾听  你是指这个吗
I know how to listen, if that's what you mean.

204
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,390
如果总统重获职位
If the president regains his office--

205
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,390
一开口就是如果怎么行  艾力克斯
"If" doesn't make for a winning opener, Alex.

206
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,840
我来这里是因为我觉得他能赢
I'm here because I think he can win.

207
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,960
我和他之间经常会有分歧
We often don't see eye to eye, he and I.

208
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,790
但我们还是可以共事的
And yet, there are ways we can work together.

209
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,770
好吧  委员会那里可能是我错了
Okay, maybe I made a mistake with the committee.

210
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,300
我有时候会有些自以为是
I can be self-righteous.

211
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,220
我是想清理党派  我们的党派
I'm trying to clean up the party. Our party.

212
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,120
结果我说错话了
And I end up speaking out of turn.

213
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,910
少来"不怪你是我的错"这一套了
It's enough with the, "It's me, not you."

214
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,020
你到底能做什么  艾力克斯
What can you deliver, Alex?

215
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,310
我可以不碍事
I can get out of the way.

216
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,470
这话太含糊  而且不够
Well, that sounds vague and inadequate.

217
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,700
我想知道泰瑞·乌麦克和黑人党团是怎么回事
I want to know what's up with Terry Womack and the Black Caucus.

218
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,070
总统和乌麦克议员
The president and Congressman Womack,

219
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,210
他们关系很好
they have a good relationship.

220
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,890
当然了  但我可不想看到泰瑞让你们失望
I'm sure they do. But I would hate to see Terry let you down.

221
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,600
如果失去了乌麦克和黑人党团  我们周一就完了
If we lose Womack and the Black Caucus, we're done on Monday.

222
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,980
有几个新人我可以搭上关系
There are a few freshmen I could reach out to.

223
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,210
他们或许能让黑人党团同心
They might help keep the CBC together.

224
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,110
你想当少数党党鞭
You wanna be minority whip.

225
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,630
如果我够格
Only if I deserve to be.

226
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,280
我准备回去了
I'm trying to get back.

227
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,850
刘易斯议员又迟到了二十分钟
Congressman Lewis is 20 minutes late as usual.

228
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,810
能让他进金融服务委员会吗
Is there a spot for him on financial services?

229
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,000
道格  待着别动
Doug, stay where you are.

230
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,050
你不是说你让中情局别插手了吗
I thought you said you were telling the CIA to stand down.

231
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,880
是啊
I did.

232
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,450
你保证过麦卡伦会老实的
So, contrary to your assurances that Macallan would behave,

233
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,580
现在却出现消息泄露
we're now dealing with a leak.

234
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,380
-他不想惹麻烦  -你怎么知道他想要什么
- He doesn't want trouble. - How do you know what he wants?

235
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,550
你去找到他  带过来
You find him and you get him here.

236
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,990
只要他知道我们让步了
As soon as he knows we've backed off,

237
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,300
他就会消失的  我保证
he will disappear. I promise.

238
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,790
不  你的保证对我毫无意义
No, that word means nothing to me.

239
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,870
你写好声明了吗
You have a statement?

240
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,540
还会不会有其他重大的
You anticipate any other big WikiLeaks info dumps

241
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,820
维基解密事件
coming down the pike?

242
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,510
-你会知道的  -等我需要知道的时候
- You'll know-- - When I need to know.

243
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,110
我知道
I know.

244
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,470
也就是上了CNN的时候吧
Which is apparently whenever it hits CNN.

245
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,860
联调局之前高度戒备  他们调查每个威胁
FBI was on high alert. They investigated every threat.

246
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:52,880
冷静
Calm down.

247
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,230
我很冷静  道格  民众不冷静
I am calm, Doug. The public's not calm.

248
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,820
每次失足都被强调  放大
Every misstep is highlighted and heightened.

249
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,660
他们想知道选举到底怎么回事
They wanna know what happened with their election.

250
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,840
我们正在解决
We're fixing it.

251
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,900
他们怕的就是这个
That's what they're afraid of.

252
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,900
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}双关"选举操纵"

253
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,940
声明是关于联调局的  大家都信任联调局
The statement's about the FBI. Everybody trusts the FBI.

254
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,030
丽萨·威廉姆斯是谁
Hey, who's Lisa Williams?

255
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,130
我不知道  怎么了
I don't know. Why?

256
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,840
《先驱报》有人打电话来
Somebody from the Herald called.

257
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,610
问你认不认识她
They were just wondering if you knew her.

258
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,570
不认识
I don't.

259
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,310
我需要五分钟审阅
I need five minutes with this.

260
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,200
-给你关门吗  -关
- Open or closed? - Closed.

261
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,360
我那份声明怎么样
Am I good with that statement?

262
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,240
我做好标记了  在我桌子上
I marked it up. It's on my desk.

263
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,590
把选举交回给各州
Throwing the election back to the states,

264
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,120
让我们的把握变小了
it gives us less certainty.

265
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,630
我觉得周一之前我们没法办妥
I don't think we can get it done by Monday.

266
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,200
我们都已经忙了几周了  弗兰西斯
We've been working at it for weeks, Francis.

267
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,810
克莱尔  别因为当职而变得小心翼翼
Claire, don't let the office make you careful.

268
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,610
国会从来没让我失望过
The halls of Congress have never failed me.

269
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,020
是  但那些职业政客
Yes, but the career politicians,

270
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,130
他们从没这么步调一致过
they are more entrenched than ever.

271
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,250
现在有了新众议院  里面的人你不认识
There's a new House, with members you don't know.

272
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,760
我们得把重点
We need to move the playing field

273
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,600
放回到人民的期望上
back to the imaginations of the people.

274
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
你这么相信田纳西和俄亥俄的选民吗
You have that much faith in the voters in Tennessee and Ohio?

275
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,600
他们会选你的  我确定
They're going to choose you. I just know it.

276
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,580
好吧
All right.

277
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,110
安排会议  我会听他们说的  你赢了
Set up a meeting. I'll hear them all out. You win.

278
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,500
是我们  是我们赢了
Both of us. Both of us.

279
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,750
晚上好
Good evening.

280
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,090
艾瑞克
Eric.

281
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,950
就像是在外面吧
Feel like you're outside?

282
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,250
你不是应该限制在三十分钟之内吗
Aren't you supposed to limit it to 30 minutes?

283
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,750
-天啊  可别  -把健身调整好就不必
- Oh, God, Jesus, no. - Not if you calibrate the workout.

284
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,090
我没事
Oh, I'm feeling fine.

285
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,120
你要听从你的身体
It's all about listening to your body.

286
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,900
它会告诉你什么时候该休息
It'll tell you when it's time to rest.

287
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,030
你有时也该听医生的  弗兰西斯
You should listen to the doctors some of the time, Francis.

288
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,760
我确定安德伍德夫妇很担心
I know the Underwoods were worried.

289
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,390
因为他们愿意做交易
Because they were ready to deal.

290
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,560
跟我做交易
To deal with me.

291
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,190
-你能肯定吗  -非常肯定
- You're sure it's for real? - Sure as I can be.

292
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,040
好  再联系
Okay, we'll be in touch.

293
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,320
好

给他打回去
So call him back.

295

成功让几个民主党人改主意了

阿尔斯波议员也要回心转意了

我们周日见他

298
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,300
为什么要等
Why wait?

299
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,890
我们明天得和国会黑人党团见面
We need to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus. Tomorrow.

300
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,820
他们是安德伍德的
They're in Underwood's pocket.

301
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,190
是啊  能让我们说句话吗  各位
Yeah. Can you give us a second, everybody?

302
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,650
好的
Uh, sure.

303
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,500
走吧

谢谢
Thank you.

305
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,600
我刚得到内部消息
I just got word from somebody inside.

306
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,390
乌麦克在失去对党团的控制
Womack is losing control of the caucus.

307
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,980
要是你能拿下他们  周一就赢了
If you win them, you win Monday.

308
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,380
我们应该试试
We should try.

309
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,860
好吧  我们试试吧
All right, fine. Let's do it.

310
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,220
-我去安排  -今晚结束了吗
- I'll set it up. - Are we done here tonight?

311
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,750
你还得打几个电话
You still have a few calls.

312
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,130
马克  我在想我们是不是能
Mark, I was thinking, maybe we could, um...

313
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,910
取消明晚在费城的活动
cancel tomorrow night in Philadelphia.

314
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,130
一趟出行和活动都不能取消  不应该取消
We can't cancel any trip, or any event. We shouldn't.

315
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,370
让我们稍稍歇歇会大有好处的
A second to catch our breath would be really helpful, I think.

316
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,640
就得这样  汉娜  需要的话你就休息一下吧
This is what it is, Hannah. If you need to take a break, you can.

317
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,550
亲爱的  我们一整周都没睡了
Darling, we haven't slept all week.

318
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,720
你累坏了
You're exhausted.

319
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,030
-我  只是说说  -下一个打给谁
- I... Just an idea. - What's my next call?

320
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,560
但你不快乐
But you're not enjoying yourself.

321
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,520
因为他不肯听我的
Because he won't listen to me.

322
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,700
众议院他赢不了
He can't win in the House.

323
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,190
我说的不是他  我说的是你
I'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you.

324
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,490
我快不快乐又有什么区别呢
What difference does it make whether I'm enjoying myself or not?

325
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,080
这不才是最重要的吗
Isn't that what this is all about?

326
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,250
你就不能...先体验它一下吗
Can't you just... live in it for a second?

327
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,440
你现在掌权了
You are in charge.

328
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,020
-对  但是  -过来
- Yes, but-- - Come here.

329
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,870
过来
Come.

330
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,220
等你明早醒来
You could wake up tomorrow...

331
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,520
你可以
and...

332
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,930
比如  喂孩子们吃饭
I don't know, feed the children...

333
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,970
挑起战争
start a war...

334
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,340
你知道吗  我很抱歉
You know what? I'm sorry.

335
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,200
我不应该把我想的都说出来
I shouldn't think out loud, that's all.

336
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,770
不  你说得对
No, you're right.

337
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,080
我们别谈这房间外发生的事了
Let's not talk about anything that happens outside of this room.

338
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,640
制裁的目标是俄罗斯的寡头阶层
The sanctions are meant to target the oligarch class in Russia.

339
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,280
我和佩特罗夫总统谈判之前
And the more members we have on board

340
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,270
我们能争取到越多成员的支持
before I sit down with President Petrov,

341
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,040
这问题就能越快得到解决
the quicker this will resolve itself.

342
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,750
已经在做了  我们准备出售一些战略储备
We are. We are prepared to release some of our strategic reserves

343
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,260
以平稳油价
to keep prices down.

344
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,600
联系卡斯皮大使  再给我争取15分钟
Contact Ambassador Caspi and buy me 15 more minutes.

345
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,500
别把这当成是和安德伍德夫妇的交易
Uh, please don't think of this as a deal with the Underwoods.

346
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,810
说实在的  他们可能周一就走了
To be frank, they could be gone by Monday.

347
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,350
但当然了  我不希望这样
That's not what I wish, of course.

348
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,400
但要知道  在这件事上
But know that you are

349
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,000
你更多是跟我合作  而不是跟他们
working more with me on this than with them.

350
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,200
沃茨议员
Congressman Watts.

351
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,580
州长  真高兴你今天来见我们
Governor, we're so happy you could join us today.

352
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,480
我也很高兴  黑人群体应该得到更好的政策
As am I. The black community deserves so much better

353
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,300
而不是弗兰克·安德伍德失败的政策
than Frank Underwood's failed policies.

354
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,090
这我们都同意
That we can agree on.

355
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,090
我期待你的政纲
I look forward to hearing about your platform.

356
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,120
-我们开始吗  -不  抱歉
- Shall we? - Oh, no, I'm sorry.

357
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
我们还得再处理一些闭门的
We have just a bit more private caucus business

358
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,770
党团议程
to attend to first.

359
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,460
你说什么
Excuse me?

360
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,930
这是国会黑人党团的会议
This is a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus.

361
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,880
我知道  所以我们才来
Well, I understand. That's... why we're here.

362
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,430
跟我说的是九点  现在已经过了一个小时了
I was told 9:00, and it's already been an hour.

363
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,520
应该叫你十点来的
You should have been told 10:00.

364
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,230
你会有机会跟我们谈的
And you will get your opportunity to address us.

365
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,630
很感谢你的耐心等待
I appreciate your patience.

366
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,250
我不会低声下气的
I'm not gonna beg.

367
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,970
对  你要微笑
No, you're gonna smile.

368
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,560
在田纳西被捕的穆罕默德·卡拉比
The Muhammed Kalabi they arrested in Tennessee

369
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,450
和哈里发国并无关联
is not the Kalabi connected to ICO.

370
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,860
你能证明这不是单纯的搞错了吗
Can you prove it wasn't just a bureaucratic mix-up?

371
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,030
目前还没有证据
Uh, not yet.

372
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,370
还有什么
What else?

373
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,870
最后一宗压制投票诉讼
Uh, final voter suppression lawsuit

374
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,090
被踢回了下级法院
was kicked back to the lower court,

375
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,700
高院的僵持助长了混乱局面
SCOTUS deadlock is feeding the chaos.

376
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,150
你看报吗  肖恩
Do you read the paper, Sean?

377
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,430
比利三天前就署名发表了关于这个的报道
Billy got a byline on that three days ago.

378
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,370
宣战怎么样
Declaration of war?

379
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,720
安德伍德之前还决心满满
Underwood was so evangelical,

380
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,910
但他已经几周没提起这个了
but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.

381
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,010
行了  够了  够了
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

382
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,480
丽萨·威廉姆斯
Lisa Williams.

383
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,350
丽莎·威廉姆斯怎么了
What about Lisa Williams?

384
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,210
我看见你和她交谈了
I saw you talking.

385
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,220
我认为她这条线可能值得追查
I thought she might be a lead worth pursuing.

386
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,670
并不
She's not.

387
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,070
她只是在利用在报上看到的东西
She's using what she read in the paper

388
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,760
博取关注或是发点小财
to get attention or a little cash.

389
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,770
我调查了一下
I did some digging.

390
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,170
她和瑞秋·波斯纳
She and Rachel Posner

391
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,720
都去过一个叫团契的教堂
both went to a church called the Fellowship.

392
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,400
-瑞秋失踪了  -打住
- Rachel disappeared-- - Stop.

393
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,810
别再扯这些关于死去姑娘的阴谋论了
No more conspiracy theories about dead girls.

394
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,130
但人们喜欢看死去姑娘的故事
But people love stories about dead girls.

395
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,970
下一场众议院投票就在后天了
The next House vote is the day after tomorrow.

396
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,200
国民坐立不安  义愤填膺
The natives are restless, outraged,

397
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,280
而且说实话  害怕了
just plain scared, actually.

398
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,440
他们希望美国不会一夜天翻地覆
They want to wake up in the America that they fell asleep in.

399
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,240
卡拉比那条线再挖挖
Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead.

400
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,730
看看能不能和安德伍德联系到一起去
See if you can connect Underwood to it.

401
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,570
这是詹姆斯·S·布雷迪媒体接待室
So, this is the James S. Brady press briefing room.

402
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,610
我们脚下其实是个游泳池
And under our feet is actually a swimming pool.

403
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,390
是由畸形儿基金会为
It was built by the March of Dimes

404
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,170
富兰克林·罗斯福总统建造的  
for President Franklin Roosevelt,

405
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,110
他患了小儿麻痹症
who had polio.

406
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,230
泳池是他唯一的健身场所
And this pool was really the only way for him to exercise.

407
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,810
罗斯福总统大部分时间
It was, an open secret

408
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,410
都是在轮椅上度过  这已是个公开的秘密了
that the president used a wheelchair most of the time.

409
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,460
因此白宫
Which is why the White House

410
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,020
是首批有残疾人专用通道的政府建筑之一
was one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings.

411
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,410
-但大家都装作他能走路吗  -是的
- But everyone pretended he could walk? - Yes.

412
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,250
-这很有风度  -是的
- That's a bit of grace. - Yeah.

413
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,060
大家都心照不宣
A thing not spoken?

414
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,720
是的  这座大楼因为他的残疾而进行了改建
Yeah, this building literally changed because of his disability.

415
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,940
但人们都很尊敬他
But people just respected him,

416
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,540
尊敬他的...
respected his, uh--

417
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,560
嗯
Right.

418
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,170
总统办公室曾承载了很重的分量
That office used to carry so much weight,

419
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,100
和很多尊敬
so much, respect.

420
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,880
你觉得现在已经不是如此了吗
You don't think it does anymore?

421
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,420
不不  我没那个意思
No, oh, no, no! I'm not saying that.

422
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,780
我是在故意为难你  我明白你的意思
I was giving you a hard time. I know what you meant.

423
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,370
抱歉  我无意打扰你们参观的
Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to hijack the tour.

424
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,540
继续...
Moving on...

425
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,110
先生们  我们可以见你们了
Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.

426
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,680
我今天可以在这儿
I could come here today

427
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,190
谈论大麻和可卡因的
and talk about federal sentencing disparities

428
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,860
联邦量刑差异
between crack and cocaine,

429
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,500
这其中显然存在种族因素
which obviously are racially motivated.

430
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,890
打断一下  你是断定滥用大麻的问题
I'm sorry, but are you asserting that the crack epidemic

431
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,670
只在黑人群体中存在吗
is exclusive to the black community?

432
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,210
不  完全不是
No, not at all.

433
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,740
但我觉得可以说  量刑差异
But I think it's fair to say that sentencing discrepancies

434
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,310
对少数群体的影响尤为严重
have disproportionately affected minority populations.

435
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,380
我们不只关注一个问题
We're not one-issue voters.

436
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,170
当然不是  这正是我的意思
Of course not. That's what I'm getting at.

437
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,670
今天会议的主旨就是扩展我们的纲领
The whole point of today's meeting is to broaden our platform.

438
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,840
共和党总是拿犯罪说事  州长
Republicans are always dwelling on crime, Governor.

439
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,660
我就是来沟通的
Well, I'm here to have a dialogue.

440
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,670
我们希望你能拿出一个方案来
We expected you to come in here with a plan.

441
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,650
我确实准备了一套方案
And I do have a plan.

442
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,900
专注于个别繁琐的立法不叫方案
Concentrating on a few pieces of onerous legislation is not a plan.

443
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,490
让我们把话说清楚...
Let's be clear...

444
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,880
这样的说辞我们听过
That kind of talk we've heard before.

445
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,000
-我是共和党人  -又来了
- I'm a Republican. - Here we go.

446
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,380
你们没有好好听我说
You're not listening.

447
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,610
我想帮助你们自力更生
Look, I want to help you help yourselves.

448
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,700
不可理喻
Unbelievable.

449
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,290
这就是我的纲领
That's my platform.

450
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,560
是吗  我听够了
Well... I've heard enough.

451
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,270
还有谁有问题想问州长
So, does anyone else have any questions for the governor?

452
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,260
我倒是有个问题
Well, I have a question.

453
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,050
弗兰西斯·安德伍德到底给了你们什么好处
What has Francis Underwood ever done for you?

454
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,570
今天早上的这出戏
This little charade this morning...

455
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,030
-演得好  真精彩  -威尔
- Well done. Quite an act. - Will.

456
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,630
-州长  -我说真的
- Governor. - No, but really.

457
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,250
你们也许和我有分歧
See, you may have differences with me...

458
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,910
你们也许真心不赞同我的观点
You may have genuine differences with me.

459
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,290
但最关键的就是这一点  "真心"
But see, that's the operative word, "genuine."

460
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,900
能否麻烦你们哪位给我解释一下
Can someone here please explain to me

461
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,160
你们为什么还对
why you all are still so loyal

462
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,290
弗兰西斯·安德伍德和民主党这么忠诚
to Francis Underwood and the Democrats?

463
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,780
总有一天
One of these days

464
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,170
在座的各位会意识到
the members of this room will realize

465
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,100
目前的现状  你们要负多大的责任
how much you actually prop up the status quo.

466
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,310
你们捞着什么好处了吗
And how's that working for ya?

467
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,240
威尔  我们先感谢各位先生女士见我们吧
Will, why don't we thank the gentlemen and women for their time?

468
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,010
你们犯了个错误
You've made a mistake.

469
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:41,650
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}选举人到华盛顿进行最后投票前6天

470
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,030
我们提议在两个未能在安全港日之前
What we're proposing is a new election in the two states

471
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,290
选出有效选举人的州
that weren't able to provide valid electors

472
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,650
重新举行大选
by the safe harbor date.

473
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,210
还能这么做
Can we even do this?

474
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,650
安静  大家安静
Hold on. Hold on, everyone!

475
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,240
我想知道
I'd like to know,

476
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,620
司法部长是什么立场
where does the attorney general stand on this?

477
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,690
正在研究  不过也同意了
Looking into it, but on board.

478
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,930
鲍勃  这种事根本没有先例
Bob, there's no precedent here.

479
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,630
没有现成的规则
There's no playbook.

480
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,280
我们只能在宪法里寻找启示
We can look to the Constitution for inspiration,

481
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,120
但它不是操作指南
but not for instruction.

482
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,800
周四的投票表明民主党人渐渐想明白了
Thursday's vote showed Democrats are coming to their senses.

483
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
我们输了一场投票  乔丹
We lost one vote, Jordan.

484
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,750
这事完全可能搞成拉锯战
We can go back and forth like this forever.

485
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,800
作为在场少数的几个共和党  我必须要说
As one of the few Republicans in the room, it needs to be said.

486
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,720
我们国家的稳定
The stability of our country

487
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,610
要比总统职位重要得多
is more important than the presidency.

488
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,950
除非民众认为他们的总统
Not if people believe the president

489
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,910
是秘密会议指定的
is being chosen behind closed doors.

490
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,240
这是宪法里写明的程序
A process that is laid out in the Constitution.

491
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,150
而这个程序完全可能让我们
The same process that can keep us gridlocked

492
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,440
再僵持两年
for the next two years.

493
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,160
决定权应该且必须归于众议院
The House should and will decide.

494
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,120
特拉华州只有一个众议员
Delaware has one congressman.

495
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,130
如果两年后你的对手告诉选民  是你
How will that play in Austin when your opponent in two years

496
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,650
让特拉华这样的小州和德州有相同的影响力
tells voters that you allowed a state like Delaware

497
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,930
你在奥斯丁还要怎么待
to have the same influence as Texas?

498
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,960
你们许多在任议员都将可能败选
A lot of you incumbents will be in danger of losing your seats.

499
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,080
就是这样
And there it is.

500
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,520
看啊  看看他们
Look. Look at them.

501
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,700
这就是忌惮失败的表情
That is the look of contemplating loss.

502
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,270
失败
Loss...

503
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,120
是这里所有人唯一听从的选民
the only constituent that anyone in this room really listens to.

504
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,550
我个人想听一下
I, for one, would like to hear

505
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,490
总统对此的看法
how the president feels about all this.

506
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,740
-我已经...  -我想我们可以
- Well, I've made my... - I think we could...

507
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,250
我是问总统先生  您刚才一直没说什么
No, Mr. President. You haven't spoken much here.

508
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,380
我们相信一人一票
We believe in one person, one vote.

509
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,490
如果不能做到这点  我们国家还算什么
If we take that away, then what is this country?

510
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,730
对不对  总统先生
Isn't that right, Mr. President?

511
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,780
完全正确  总统女士
Absolutely, Madam President.

512
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,030
等等  等下  我往下挪挪
Wait, hold it. Let me just move down a bit.

513
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,890
我老是要从讲台上滑下来
I keep slipping off the podium.

514
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,660
-你接着我  -好些了吗
- You got me. - That better?

515
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,290
嗯  好爽
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

516
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,290
话说林肯室
So the Lincoln...

517
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,470
那真是他的办公室吗
That was actually his office?

518
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,940
能不说工作吗
Can we... can we not?

519
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,320
-你能  把我往上托一托吗  -好
- Can you... can you move me up a bit? - Yeah.

520
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,330
好了
Okay.

521
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,400
-还顺利吗  -再看吧
- How'd it go? - We'll see.

522
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,430
我需要你再过一遍南极洲事件的声明稿
I need you to look over the Antarctica statement again.

523
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,980
都听你的
Whatever you need.

524
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,190
陪我走走吧
Walk with me?

525
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,050
我有点担心弗兰西斯
I'm worried about Francis.

526
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,030
-为什么  -我可能需要你帮我一把
- Why? - I might need you to save me.

527
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,060
-这样是不行的  -为什么
- This is not going to work. - Why?

528
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,230
如果他没赢  那我还是输
If he loses, I still lose.

529
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,740
他不能站在圈外看着我们忙活
He cannot be on the outside looking in.

530
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,380
他会赢的
He'll win.

531
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,070
你真的这么想
You actually believe that?

532
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,890
当然  为什么不呢
Sure... why not?

533
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,520
这本就是赌一把
It was a wager.

534
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,530
有潜在收益  所以有必要赌
The potential gains made it necessary.

535
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,290
完全是浪费我的时间
It was a complete waste of my time.

536
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,240
如果你还不开始扭转局势
If you don't start turning things around,

537
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,830
你他妈就得滚蛋  明白吗
you're going to be out on your fucking ass. You understand?

538
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,430
明白
I do.

539
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,850
我该跟你说明白一件事  州长
I should explain something to you, Governor.

540
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,870
如果你再那样跟我说话
If you ever talk to me like that again...

541
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,710
我会确保你这辈子再赢不了一场选举
I'll make sure you never win another election in your life.

542
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,110
-你在威胁我吗  -不  我只是把话说开
- Are you threatening me? - No, I'm enlightening you.

543
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,790
康威州长  你好  先生
Governor Conway. Hello, sir.

544
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,910
情况如何  我来看看
How you doin'? Take a peek,

545
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,860
-你不介意吧  机长  -州长
- if you don't mind, Captain? - Governor.

546
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,490
我过去也开过飞机
I used to fly, too, you know.

547
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,290
引擎的最大推力是多少
What kinda max thrust you get on these engines?

548
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,080
-约六千四百磅  -六千四百磅
- About 6,400 pounds. - 6,400 pounds.

549
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,750
我过去开的飞机更大  推力更强
I used to fly something a lot bigger, a lot more power,

550
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,800
但飞机上的武器很重
but it was so weighed down with all the weaponry,

551
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
像在驾驶坦克
it was like flying a tank.

552
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,710
不如你让我开会儿
Why don't you let me in for a second,

553
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,530
让我控制操纵杆
just flip me the controls?

554
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,780
抱歉  先生  不行
I'm sorry, sir. I can't.

555
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,580
别这样  我...
Come on, I...

556
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,190
我只是想感受一下操纵杆的力道
I just want to feel the weight on the stick for a second.

557
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,640
我也想  但你不在飞行计划中
I wish I could, but, uh, you're not on the flight plan.

558
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,650
你知道我经验丰富吧
You know I've been in situations,

559
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,890
我遭遇过攻击
where, like, I've been shot at.

560
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,210
你明白吧
You realize that, right?

561
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,080
你觉得我驾驭不了十千米高空中的双引擎
You don't think I can handle a twin engine at 35,000 feet,

562
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,870
飞机还是平稳地飞越农田
straight and level over some farm country?

563
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,110
拜托  先生
I mean, come on, sir.

564
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,090
先生
Sir.

565
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,920
您还是回主舱吧
You should probably go back to the main cabin.

566
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,790
你知道我会成为总统吧
You know I'm gonna be the president, right?

567
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,710
-希望如此  先生  -你希望如此
- I hope so, sir. - You hope so?

568
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,170
我只是说我支持你  先生
I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.

569
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,440
我一定会成为总统
I'm gonna be the president,

570
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,880
你也一定要把那该死的操纵杆给我
and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.

571
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,170
威尔  过来
Will, come on.

572
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
-干吗  你想怎样  -我只是
- What? What do you want? - I just

573
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,040
得跟你谈一会儿  行吗
I need to talk to you for a minute, please.

574
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,570
我只是在跟飞行员聊天
I was just talking to the pilots.

575
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,470
行  你得冷静下来  行吗
Okay, I need you to calm down, okay?

576
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,830
呼吸
Breathe.

577
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,410
威尔  不如你坐下
Will, why don't you sit down?

578
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,340
不如你他妈闭嘴
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

579
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,220
我要炒了你
I'll fire you.

580
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,570
把你留在跑道上
I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac.

581
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,670
好吧
Okay.

582
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,590
你他妈想怎样
What the fuck are you gonna do?

583
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,800
坐下来  别耍孩子气
Sit down and try and act like an adult...

584
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,710
至少要有点下任美国总统的样子
or at least like the next President of the United States.

585
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,220
坐下
Sit.

586
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:52,710
他们是谁
Who are they?

587
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,930
或许是印尼的秘密警察
Maybe Indonesian secret police?

588
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,330
不付钱会怎样
What if we don't pay?

589
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,230
还有其他买家吗
Are there other buyers?

590
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,940
不清楚
I don't know.

591
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,850
我会处理好的
I'll take care of it.

592
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,050
-怎么做  -别问我
- How? - Don't ask how.

593
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,670
我会找回麦卡伦
I'll get Macallan back.

594
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,790
显然这事得保密
Obviously, this stays between us.

595
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,750
说"谢谢  道格"
Say, "Thank you, Doug."

596
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,340
谢谢  道格
Thank you, Doug.

597
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,530
我们在公交车上认识的
We met on a bus.

598
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,090
她当时在听歌
She was listening to music.

599
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,420
我问她要不要去我以前常去的一间教堂
And I asked her to go to this church I used to go to.

600
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,310
-那是在哪  -马里兰
- Where was that? - Maryland.

601
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,610
冬离团契
The Winter's Run Fellowship.

602
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,590
巴尔的摩往北一小时路程
About an hour north of Baltimore.

603
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,260
然后呢
So, then what?

604
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,100
我们就是...
I don't know. We just...

605
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,680
成了朋友  然后就超越了朋友
became friends. And then it became more than that.

606
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,280
开始每晚在一起
Started spending every night together.

607
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,870
后来  她告诉我有个男人
At some point, she told me about this guy

608
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,750
常常过去查看她的情况
who used to come around to check on her.

609
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,900
-那男人长什么样  -我没见过他
- What'd he look like? - I never saw him.

610
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,200
只是有时  她说他要来
Just sometimes she said he was coming,

611
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,150
就没法跟我在一起
so she couldn't hang out.

612
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,320
她并不怎么跟我讲他的事
She wouldn't really tell me anything about him.

613
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,590
你没事吧
Everything okay?

614
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,590
没事  失陪一下
Yeah, do you mind?

615
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,510
我朋友在那边  我得去见他
I just need to see my friend up there.

616
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,120
你好吗
How are you doing?

617
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,270
谢谢
Thanks.

618
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,380
你认为那儿有石油
You think there's oil there.

619
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,200
你想争取开采权
You're positioning to stake a claim.

620
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,120
南极洲并没有俄国军队
There are no Russian troops in Antarctica.

621
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,790
我们愿对《南极条约》缔约国
We're willing to recommend changes

622
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,420
提出修改建议
to the Antarctic Treaty parties.

623
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,730
安德伍德夫妇被赶出白宫后  你会怎么样
What happens to you when the Underwoods are ejected from office?

624
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,840
到大学去教国际关系
You teach international relations at a university?

625
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,170
还是加入智囊团
Or work for a think tank?

626
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,000
我还没想那么远
I haven't thought that far ahead.

627
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
你应该有吧
I think you have.

628
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,970
你不觉得全世界迟早会发现
How long do you expect the world to believe

629
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,860
那是你的军队吗
those aren't your soldiers?

630
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,740
你喜欢替安德伍德夫妇工作吗
Do you like working for the Underwoods?

631
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,480
你有多忠诚
How loyal are you?

632
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,460
关键时刻  你会支持他们
When the time comes, will you stand with them...

633
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,100
还是抛弃他们
or not?

634
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,300
我明天离开
I leave tomorrow.

635
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,750
关于制裁的新闻会在周一爆出
News of the sanctions will hit Monday.

636
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,620
你走之前我们见个面
Let's meet before you go.

637
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,370
你是外交专家  专业人士
You're a career diplomat, a professional.

638
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,430
或许因此我信任你
Maybe that's why I trust you.

639
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,790
你会照顾他们
Then you take care of them,

640
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,480
他们感觉好了  就会照顾你
so they feel good and they take care of you.

641
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,390
那你就会感觉好...
So you feel good because...

642
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,600
瑞秋美丽动人
I mean, Rachel was really beautiful.

643
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,940
你站在街对面就能看得出来
You could tell that from across the street.

644
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,640
但我从来没有隔着街看过她
I never saw her from across the street, though.

645
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,600
仔细想想是不是很奇妙
Isn't that a funny thing to think about?

646
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,490
我觉得  有时候
A lot of people, I think,

647
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,930
很多人隔着街就能认出他们的心上人
they spot the one they love from across the street sometimes.

648
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,400
比如说他们出门办事
It's like they're running an errand,

649
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,770
碰巧看见他们的心上人
and they happen to spot the one they love

650
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,140
在街对面  办着别的事
across the street running a different errand.

651
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,480
心里一阵激动
There's this sudden thrill, like...

652
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,710
因为你的爱人
while the person you love

653
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,090
和你居住在同一个世界
is inhabiting the same world as you.

654
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,160
而他们只是很随意地
And they're just walking around,

655
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,680
出门买个维生素水之类的
buying, I don't know... Vitaminwater,

656
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,740
或许他们这么做时  知道你爱着他们
and maybe they know that you love them while they're doing it,

657
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,370
或许他们因此会对店员友善
and maybe it means they're nice to a cashier.

658
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,940
但是我从来没有隔着街看过她
I never got to see her from across the street, though.

659
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,650
从来没有
It just never happened.

660
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,300
别烫伤自己了
I don't want you to burn yourself.

661
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,180
不会烫伤的
No burning, no.

662
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,940
瑞秋爱抽烟
Rachel liked to smoke.

663
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,220
她说打算戒掉
She said she was gonna stop,

664
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,110
但她定了个规则  只有我们一起听
but she would have a rule that she'd only smoke

665
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,110
我们共同喜爱的乐队时  她才能抽烟
when we listened to this one band we both loved.

666
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,360
因为那是仪式
Because of the ceremony.

667
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:01,600
"这该成为一个仪式"  她这么说的
"It should be a ceremony," it's what she said.

668
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,530
即使是口香糖
Well, even if it's gum,

669
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,760
我还是想到外面嚼
I still prefer to step outside to chew it.

670
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,070
像是在点燃一根美味的香烟
Like lighting a delicious cigarette.

671
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,690
我们所怀念的  那种仪式感
The things we miss, the rituals...

672
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,060
我先走了
Excuse me.

673
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,780
-她不喜欢我  -她以后会的
- She doesn't like me. - She will.

674
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,120
感谢你过来和他见面
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him.

675
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,370
你知道法律上  你无法赶走克莱尔·安德伍德
You know you can't legally remove Claire Underwood,

676
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,340
即便你在众议院获胜
even if you win in the House?

677
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,500
我正在想办法
I'm working on that.

678
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,030
我没兴趣
I'm not interested.

679
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,580
他需要你  我需要你
He needs you. I need you.

680
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,000
国家也需要你
So does the country.

681
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,850
我不是政客
I'm not a politician.

682
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,330
我能下达命令  也能遵从命令
I can give orders, I can follow orders

683
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,070
我知道何时该闭嘴
and I know when the hell to shut up.

684
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,740
你是个稳重的人  国家需要这种人
And you're a steady hand, which, again, the country needs.

685
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,610
-我可不当康威的替死鬼  -你不会的
- I'm not gonna be Conway's patsy. - No, you're not.

686
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,370
他是个难相处的人
He's a difficult man to be around.

687
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,540
已经结束了
It's over. It's over.

688
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,430
宪法程序选择了克莱尔·安德伍德
The process chose Claire Underwood.

689
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,420
我们会有办法的
We'll get there.

690
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,110
你会被称为副总统
You'll be called vice president,

691
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,700
但实际上  你将做到更多
but you will be, de facto, something more.

692
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,560
你去那儿做什么
What were you doing there?

693
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,370
我去问赛斯·格雷森关于丽萨·威廉姆斯的事
I asked Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams.

694
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,790
你为什么会认为可以这么做
Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do?

695
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,320
我不是叫你别管这条线索了吗
Didn't I tell you to drop this lead?

696
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,140
这还算线索吗  因为没人在查
Is it still a lead? Because nobody's on it.

697
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,220
没人在查是因为她是瘾君子
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie,

698
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,480
而她告诉我的一切
and everything she said to me

699
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,840
卢卡斯·古德温的宣言里都有
is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto,

700
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,960
而宣言的每一字每一句  都被网上各大论坛
which has been picked apart by every message board

701
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,100
和阴谋论者掰烂嚼碎了
and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.

702
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,240
一开始  格雷森说对她的名字没印象
At first, Grayson said her name didn't ring a bell,

703
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,840
然后他突然联系我
but then he called me out of the blue

704
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,300
问我是不是还在查这个事
and asked me if we were still looking into it.

705
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,530
所以我就查了
So I followed up.

706
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,870
你偷看了我的笔记
You looked through my notes.

707
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,690
滚
You're out.

708
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,780
-什么  -你被开除了  杰弗瑞斯
- What? - You're fired, Jeffries.

709
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,390
这是个故事  我在跟进这个故事
It's a story. I was following it.

710
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,680
我不希望你跟着我干了
I don't want you on my team.

711
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,340
滚出我的办公室
Get out of my office.

712
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,950
我们知道我们能赢下这两个州
We know we can win both states.

713
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,330
为什么不接受这个交易
Why would we not take this deal?

714
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,640
不  安德伍德夫妇想重新投票
No. The Underwoods want a revote

715
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,280
是因为他们知道拿不下众议院  而我们能
because they know they can't win in the House. We can.

716
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,040
我们要做个交易  逼克莱尔·安德伍德辞职
We need to make a deal that forces Claire Underwood to resign.

717
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,240
-她有那么重要吗  -我能说两句吗
- And why does that matter? - If I may?

718
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,680
-议长女士  -就国会而言
- Madam Speaker. - Speaking from the Hill,

719
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,990
作为副总统
as vice president,

720
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,520
她可以利用这个平台公开抹黑你的所有动作
she'll have a public pulpit to discredit your every move.

721
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,660
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}美国副总统官邸

722
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,660
我会把克莱尔·安德伍德流放到海军天文台I'm going to exile Claire Underwood to the Naval Observatory

723
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,920
让她整天在东南亚出席国葬仪式
and stack her schedule with state funerals in Southeast Asia.

724
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,540
她别想参与白宫的决策
She'll never see the inside of the West Wing,

725
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,460
更别提干涉总统了
let alone the Oval.

726
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,600
你需要布洛哈特在你身边支持你
You need Brockhart by your side, supporting you.

727
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,050
我不想再听布洛哈特的事了
I don't want to hear about Brockhart.

728
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,130
重要的是让威尔当上总统
What matters is that Will becomes president.

729
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,370
安德伍德在你的政府里会造成巨大破坏的
Underwood in office can cause an enormous amount damage.

730
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,860
反过来如果他们输了  他们就全完了
Whereas, if they lose, they're losers.

731
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,570
我希望这场选举是在我
I want this election to be between me

732
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,150
和弗兰西斯·安德伍德之间
and Francis Underwood.

733
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,490
这你说了不算
Well, it isn't up to you.

734
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,450
麦卡锡议长不会让这个议案进入投票的
Speaker McCarthy isn't letting this particular bill to the floor,

735
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,100
除非我们附加一项修正案
unless we have an amendment attached

736
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,650
将克莱尔·安德伍德赶走
that removes Claire Underwood.

737
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,890
威尔
Will...

738
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,950
如果你希望白宫里有位愿意合作的总统
Now, if you expect a willing partner in the White House,

739
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:42,860
那你最好让议案原样进入表决
you'd better let that bill get to the floor as is.

740
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,040
如果你坐进总统办公室  威尔
If you get to the Oval, Will,

741
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,260
那时是你更需要议长  而不是反过来
you're gonna need the Speaker more than she needs you.

742
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,120
我这就给她打回去
So, I'm gonna call her back,

743
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,200
然后你要道歉
and you are going to apologize.

744
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,560
威尔
Will.

745
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,570
威尔  回来
Will, get back here!

746
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,040
威尔
Will!

747
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,880
别逼他了
Enough.

748
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,600
关门
Shut the door.

749
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,610
你看着像死人
You look like death.

750
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,270
我联系不上绑匪了
I can't get in touch with the kidnappers.

751
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,310
快一天了  什么消息都没有
It's been radio silence for almost 24 hours.

752
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,850
有传言说他已经不在绑匪手上了
There's rumors they don't even have him anymore.

753
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,550
这事我不能再瞒着总统了
I can't keep this from the president any longer.

754
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:03,050
好吧
Okay.

755
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,850
那我会告诉他你帮了好大的忙
And then I'll tell him what a big help you've been.

756
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,250
再过几小时制裁就要生效了
Sanctions hit in a couple of hours.

757
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,240
你要么和杜兰特国务卿谈
Deal with Secretary Durant

758
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,030
要么对付几个愤怒的亿万富翁去吧
or with some very unhappy billionaires.

759
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,250
你要让我在南极洲任意开采石油
You will allow me to exploit whatever oil I find in Antarctica.

760
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,770
我告诉你为什么
And I'll tell you why.

761
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,850
我手上有料
I have something.

762
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,080
或者说有你们想要的人
Or rather, someone you need.

763
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,550
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

764
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,170
你们政府里有人
Someone in your administration

765
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,770
愿花大钱换他平安回国
was willing to pay a great deal of money for his safe return.

766
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,900
你的艾丹·麦卡伦
Your Aidan Macallan.

767
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,460
他在这里  就在克里姆林宫里
He's here. In the Kremlin.

768
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,750
不然你以为是谁泄的密
Who do you think orchestrated that leak?

769
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,690
看来他知道的不少啊
Seems to know quite a lot.

770
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,630
失陪一下  你们国务卿来了
Excuse me one moment. The Secretary of State is here.

771
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,480
-国务卿女士  -先生们
- Madam Secretary. - Gentlemen.

772
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,600
想必你认识艾丹吧
You must know Aidan?

773
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,290
我想我不认识他
I don't believe I do.

774
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,730
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

775
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,200
-你是美国人  -是
- You're American? - I am.

776
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,080
开始会谈之前  我想让你知道
Before we begin, I'd just like you to know that

777
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,930
你们的总统和前总统都在线上
the president and the former president are on the line.

778
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,810
凯茜
Cathy...

779
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,170
你愿意的话可以接听
You can pick up the phone, if you like.

780
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,860
总统先生
Mr. President.

781
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,750
你最好先回华盛顿
It's best you come back to Washington.

782
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:41,930
有什么发现吗
Find anything yet?

783
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,420
还没
Not yet.

784
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,980
再次感谢  巴恩斯先生
Thank you again, Mr. Barnes,

785
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,540
谢谢你让我看
for letting me take a look.

786
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,300
我不会看太久
I won't be long.

787
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,660
这就是全部吗
This is everything?

788
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,440
这是他们从佐伊的公寓寄来的一切
This is everything they sent from Zoe's apartment.

789
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,140
我就是
I just, you know...

790
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,080
我不忍扔掉任何东西
I just can't seem to throw anything out.

791
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,380
只是些文件  但是
I mean, it's just papers, but...

792
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,140
不管怎样  你自便
Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

793
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,330
-好  谢谢  -没事
- Okay. Thank you. - Yeah.

794
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,340
好吧
Okay.

795
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,060
黑人党团  不是吧
The Black Caucus? Really?

796
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,820
我喜欢马克  因为我总是知道他的立场
I like Mark, because I always know where he stands.

797
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,500
通常是对人步步紧逼
It's usually on someone's neck.

798
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,080
你给自己争取到了什么  一天时间吗
What did you buy yourselves, another day?

799
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,110
足够跟大卫·拉斯姆森谈了
Enough time to talk to David Rasmussen,

800
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,950
显然你早就跟他谈过
who you clearly spoke to before.

801
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,410
然后又见了乔丹·萨多斯基
And to meet with Jordan Sadowsky

802
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,010
和剩下的共和党领导人
and the rest of the Republican leadership.

803
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,310
那星期二呢  星期三呢
And what happens Tuesday? Or Wednesday?

804
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,320
我能让大卫和众议院
Look, I... I can have David and the House

805
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,800
每次会议都对此进行投票
vote on this every single session.

806
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,070
我们背景不同
Our backgrounds are different,

807
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,300
但内心里我们都是穷小子
but we're both hardscrabble boys at heart.

808
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,450
我们需要最后一个字  最后一击
We need the last word, last blow,

809
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,650
最后一举
last move.

810
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,260
我们能让众议院通过议案
We can push the bill through the House

811
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,000
在田纳西州和俄亥俄州重新选举总统
for a new election for president in Tennessee and Ohio.

812
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,920
麦卡锡议长不会允许那种事发生
Speaker McCarthy won't let that happen.

813
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,470
但我能说服她
But I could... convince her

814
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:04,890
如果你辞职
if you were to step down,

815
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,820
我们在田纳西州和俄亥俄州
and our full tickets president and vice president

816
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,110
同时进行总统和副总统的选举
run against each other in Tennessee and Ohio.

817
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,630
那可不行  那可不行
Well, to hell with that. Well, to hell with that.

818
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,270
我们接受交易  我想这是正确的做法
We'll make the deal. I think this is the right thing to do.

819
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,740
明天我会宣布
Tomorrow, I'll announce my intention

820
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,120
在重新投票后我就辞职
to step down after the revote.

821
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,170
我会通知议长让议案进入投票表决
I'll let the Speaker know to put the bill on the floor.

822
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,390
我们还有一件非常重要的事
We have one more outstanding piece of business,

823
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,850
最高法院提名人
the Supreme Court nominee.

824
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,120
我们需要任命个人来打破四四僵局
We'll need to appoint someone to break the four-four deadlock.

825
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,080
批准国会的新选举日
Approve Congress' new election date.

826
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,240
我们有几个人选
We, uh, have several people in mind.

827
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,110
我希望你们任命伊丽莎白·本森
I want you to appoint Elizabeth Benson.

828
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,870
她足够开放  你可以接受
Well, she's liberal enough for you to swallow,

829
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,950
必要的时候又足够保守
and conservative enough when it counts.

830
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,910
但我们没时间开参议院听证会
Yes, but we don't have time for Senate hearings.

831
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,440
我可以让参议院休会
I can make a recess happen.

832
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,110
竞选活动上见
I'll see you on the campaign trail.

833
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,100
那置我于何地  艾力克斯
Where does that leave me, huh, Alex?

834
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,390
我冒了巨大风险
I went out on a limb here.

835
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,180
如果我们没拿下众议院  那怎么办
If we don't have a vote in the House, then what?

836
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:20,280
马克·厄舍是你的朋友  不是我的
Mark Usher is your friend, not mine.

837
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,010
马克·厄舍不是任何人的朋友
Mark Usher's no one's friend.

838
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,280
弗兰西斯·安德伍德什么也没赢  好吗
Francis Underwood hasn't won a thing, okay?

839
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,870
威尔·康威有可能  很大的可能
And there's a good... More than a good chance that Will Conway

840
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,450
会成为下一任美国总统
will be the next President of the United States.

841
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,700
能让我单独待会儿吗  这几天太艰难了
Could you give me a moment? It's been a difficult few days.

842
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,300
好点吗
Better?

843
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,200
嗯
Yes.

844
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,540
我们不能按原计划让众议院周一投票
We couldn't let the House vote proceed on Monday.

845
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,350
为什么
Why not?

846
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,340
因为你会输的
Because you would've lost.

847
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,010
即使康威当了总统
Even if Conway took the presidency,

848
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,720
有你  我们还是会有立足之地
we would've had a foothold with you.

849
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,570
我们可以破坏他们  就像对沃克夫妇那样
We could've sabotaged, just like we did with the Walkers.

850
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:33,590
康威夫妇不是沃克夫妇
The Conways are not the Walkers.

851
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,250
那不是你能决定的
It wasn't your decision to make.

852
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,670
你说什么
Excuse me?

853
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,530
你自己说的  你只是代总统
You said it yourself. You're only acting.

854
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,230
我赞同厄舍
I agreed with Usher

855
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,820
是因为他会不惜一切
because he will sacrifice everything

856
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,330
让布洛哈特上位
to get Brockhart into office,

857
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,290
而这就让康威变弱  容易失败
which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.

858
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,320
我以为你和我看法相同
I thought you saw what I saw.

859
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,060
确实
I did. I do.

860
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,870
我们完全同步  克莱尔
We're perfectly in sync, Claire.

862
00:53:28,210 --> 00:54:28,210
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}最高法院基本任命流程是  当法院出现空缺  总统提名一个人选
然后参议院举行公开听证会  一般持续三到五天
然后参议院进行投票  如果被提名者获得多数票  就可以宣誓就职  
历史上也出现过休会任命大法官
但休会任命的局限是  在参议院复会后  还是要进行任命投票
在最高法院大法官的任命投票上  民主党在控制参议院时
取消了原有的阻挠议事  允许51票简单多数即可过关
这种规则的更改  却让共和党占了便宜
在不久前特朗普提名大法官后  因为目前共和党控制了参议院
虽然民主党非常反对  但共和党仍靠简单多数投票让大法官上任了

864
00:54:28,210 --> 00:55:28,210
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}在美国早期  现代政党系统还没有成型的时候
出现过正副总统分属不同党派的情况
亚当斯做总统时  副总统杰斐逊跟他不是一个党派
创立了共和党的林肯  出于选举策略的考虑  选了民主党杰克逊做副总统
根据法律  这种情况是可能出现的
因为一旦选举结果有争议  需要国会来投票选举总统时
总统是由众议院选举产生  而副总统是由参议院选举产生
这就可能出现正副总统不同党  但历史上没有发生过
