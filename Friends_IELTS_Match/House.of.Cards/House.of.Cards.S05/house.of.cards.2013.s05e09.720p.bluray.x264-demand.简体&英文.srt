The general talked about killing the president.

再加上康威在飞机上的爆发
That, along with Conway's outburst on the plane--

27
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,240
这么说好像夸大了实际情况
That sounds worse than it was.

28
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,540
不  实际情况就是这么严重
No, that sounds exactly as bad as it was.

29
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,240
让我觉得惊讶的是
What's surprising to me is...

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,970
选举团队竟然应对不过来
the campaign couldn't get their hands around this.

他们先是否认  接着又模棱两可
First they denied, and then they equivocated--

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,480
这简直太荒唐了
I mean, that's just, like, ridiculous.

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,350
你站出来
You just come out,

35
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,020
"我道歉  我们说错话了"
"I apologize. We misspoke."

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,240
这一点我怎么也想不通
Which I will never understand.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,850
威尔·康威可是党内冉冉升起的新星
Will Conway was a rising star in the party.

42
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,110
怎么能跟安德伍德政治机器相匹敌呢
Look, it's hard to compete with the Underwood machine.

43
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,400
天啊  我们别再说这些"阴谋占领"的疯话了
God. Let's not do the whole "black helicopters" crazy stuff.

44
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,980
太荒唐了
It's ridiculous.

45
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,660
我们得接受安德伍德赢得大选这一事实
Look, we need to accept Underwood won the election.

46
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,570
公众得接受这个结果  继续前进
People need to accept the outcome and move on.

47

我同意范的观点
I'm gonna agree with Van.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,710
我觉得我们应该感激宪法
I think we need to take a moment to appreciate the Constitution.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,780
-但不会折断[毁坏]  -说得没错
- but it never broke. - That's right.

51
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,470
我们都知道  到最后
And in the end, as we all know,

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,500
还是由选举人团决定
it came down to the Electoral College.

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,990
你不用说那句话  州长
You don't have to say the words, Governor.

54
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,090
我应该说
I think I do.

55
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,540
恭喜  当选总统先生
Congratulations, Mr. President Elect.

56

这次没有稿子吗
There's no script for this one?

57
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,620
国家第一  先生
Country first, sir.

58
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,790
我很高兴你这么说  威尔
I'm glad to hear you say that, Will.

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,820
我想帮这个国家愈合
I want to start to help the country heal again.

We are done. But Will...

我很想向国家展示
I would very much like to show the country

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,950
我们两党可以齐心协作
that our two parties can work together.

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,580
我希望你考虑
So I was hoping that you might consider

65
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,380
做我的运输部长
becoming my transportation secretary.

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,710
如果你同意加入我的内阁
I think it would send a powerful message

67
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,310
会发出一个强有力的信号
if you agreed to join my cabinet.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,130
你觉得我能
You think I'd...

69
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,330
当好运输部长吗
make a good... transportation secretary?

70
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,560
没错
Yes.

71
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,420
这是开给无名议员的条件
That's what you give the congressman from nowhere.

72
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,300
我会拒绝的
I'll be declining.

73
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,080
听到你这么说真是太遗憾了  威尔
Well, I'm so sorry to hear that, Will.

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,380

我现在做什么
What do I do now?

77
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,620
所有人都以为威尔会赢
...everyone thought it would happen.

78
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,570
没人想到安德伍德还能赢
No one thought that Underwood would win again...

79
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,640
我不知道
I don't know.

80
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,710
承认失败从来都不容易
Acknowledging defeat is never easy.

81
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,250
在公众面前承认更是无比煎熬
Doing it in public is a living hell.

82
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,900
起码媒体喜欢他
Well, at least the cameras like him.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,630
我看着满意吗
Do I look satisfied?

84
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,210
你看着还算满意
You look somewhat satisfied.

85
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,870
-好  -"好"可不够
- Good. - Not good.

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,970

87
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,050
-这是你应得的  -是"我们"吧

88

我们成功到达另一边了
We made it to the other side.

89
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,110
是啊
Yes.

90
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,020
但另一边有什么
But what is on the other side?

91
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,640

稍带点失败的气息
With a whiff of defeat.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,820
花了好久才走到这一步
It's taken a long time to get here,

94
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,880
但我们到了
but we're here.

95
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,620

Cheers, Francis.

96

今后一切都会变得容易
Everything gets easier from now on.

97
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,430
他们准备好了
They're ready for you.

98
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,780
-汉娜  -我不想去
- Hannah. - I don't want to go.

99
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,790
不
No.

100
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,940
好吧
Fine.

101
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,760
那我自己去吧
I'll do it on my own.

102
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,150
要知道  这是个重要时刻
I'm gonna say, this is a crucial moment.

103

对你们两个都是
For both of you.

104
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,250
看你们如何应对
How you handle tonight.

105
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,790
党抛弃了我
The party abandoned me.

106
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,010
你的党
Your party.

107
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,480
我不是共和党  威尔
I'm not the Republican Party, Will.

108
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,450
我只为候选人效力
I work for candidates.

109
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,190
我为你效力
I worked for you.

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,330
听好  你输了
Listen, you lost.

111
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,510
但还有一多半国民
But more than half the country

112
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,710
仍认为你是他们的总统
still considers you their president.

113
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,090
你必须要面对他们
This is what's required.

114
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,790
走出去  发表讲话
Go down there, give your speech.

115
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,040
认输吧
Concede.

116
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,260
我正式接受各位的辞呈
As I accept all of your letters of resignation

117
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,780
并解散我的旧内阁
and dissolve my old cabinet,

118
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,840
然后我想欢迎在座各位加入我的新内阁
I wanna welcome each and every one of you to my new cabinet.

119
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,680
-恭喜你  总统先生  -谢谢  凯茜
- Congratulations, Mr. President. - Thank you, Cathy.

120
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,700
我尤其想感谢我的妻子
And I especially wanna thank my wife.

121
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,900

感谢你对我长期坚定的支持

Your steady hand kept this country running this past month.

124
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,240
我欠她太多  多到我无法想象
I owe her more than I can possibly fathom.

125
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
而她也欠我
And she owes me.

126
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,020
不对  你一直在我身边支持着我
Not true. You were with me all the way.

127
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,810
作为合法当选总统
I would like to make my first 100 days

128
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,920
我希望我的头一百天能取得尽可能多的成绩
as the duly elected president as productive as possible.

129
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,790
当然  挑战还是很多的
Of course, there are many challenges.

130
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,150
提振经济
Shoring up the economy,

131
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,910
保护我国不受哈里发国攻击
securing our nation from ICO

132
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,420
还要降低失业率
and reducing unemployment.

133
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,440
但我们面对的最艰巨的问题
But the biggest challenge that we face,

134
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,800
也是我最需要各位通力协助的挑战
and the one that I'm going to need all of your help on,

135
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,990
就是重新团结全国
is reuniting a country

136
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,280
弥合这个国家前所未有的裂痕
that has never been more divided than it is today.

137
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,530
我相信我们可以迎难而上
I believe we can meet this challenge,

138
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,960
而我需要各位的帮助
and that's where I'm gonna need all of your help.

139
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,200
所以今天我们就开始治愈国家
So let's let the healing begin today

140
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,500
共同创造历史吧
and let's make history together.

141
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,020
感谢你们长久的辛勤奉献
I thank you all for your continued service.

142
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,630
现在回去工作吧
Now let's get back to work.

143
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,000
我需要一分钟
I need a minute.

144
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,500
我想我们应该早做打算
I think we should see what we can do

145
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,260
把厄舍赶走
about making Usher persona non grata.

146
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,620
现在开战不合适吧
I don't think that's wise to start a war.

147
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,200
我们才刚刚拿下白宫
We've just won the White House.

148
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,280
现在才是出手的最佳时机
This is exactly when we should strike.

149
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,810
只有现在我们才有足够的政治资本
This is a moment that we have the political capital...

150
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,690
厄舍必须小心处理
Usher needs to be managed carefully.

151
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,310
总统先生
Mr. President?

152
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,020
喘口气吧  道格
Take a breath, Doug.

153
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,030
我们才刚刚站稳脚跟
We've only just landed on our feet here.

154
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,840
先生  副总统女士
Sir, Madam Vice President,

155
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,600
过去在众议院  这种人就是重点打击对象
this is the type of person that we used to crucify in the House.

156
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,420
但现在我们不在众议院  我们在白宫
Yes, but we're not in the House now. We're here.

157
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,110
我们还有一整个任期呢
We have a full term ahead of us.

158
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,600
我们肯定会取得
There's gonna be a great deal

159
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
非常多的成就
that we're gonna be able to accomplish,

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,220
咱们三个合作
the three of us.

161
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,480
感谢您的器重  先生
I appreciate that, sir.

162
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,590
但是马克·厄舍早晚会变成麻烦的
But Mark Usher will become a problem.

163
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,050
每个人早晚都会变成麻烦
Well, everyone becomes a problem, eventually.

164
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,300
莉安出局了
LeAnn's out.

165
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,450
什么
What?

166
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,290
为什么
Why?

167
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,920
她搞砸了
She screwed up.

168
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,850
有什么需要我准备的吗
Well, is it something I need to get ready for?

169
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,230
安德伍德夫妇希望间接处理她
The Underwoods want this handled indirectly.

170
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,060
所以我们具体该说什么
So what exactly are we saying?

171
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,760
她被赶走了
She's being pushed out.

172
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,100
好  但是选举结束了
Okay, but the campaign's over.

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,830
还有必要对外说什么吗
Is it necessary to say anything?

174
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,730
我们需要撇清本届政府与她
We need to distance this administration

175
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,020
和她工作的关系
from her and her work.

176
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,610
还有她的策略
Her tactics.

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,710
得装成是泄露出去的
So it needs to be a leak.

178
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,940
泄露给不喜欢我们的人
Reach out to the people who don't like us.

179
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,510
他们肯定乐意爆料
They'll be prime to go with it.

180
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,460
等我们回应的时候
Okay, so when we respond...

181
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,240
-是公开还是  -公开
- On the record or... - On.

182
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,570
她做了什么
What did she do?

183
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,540
她展现出了很差的判断力
She showed some very poor judgment.

184
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,620
我相信你会谨慎的
I'm trusting you to be discreet.

185
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,530
我们赢了  赛斯
We won, Seth.

186
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,380
需要做出一些改变
Changes need to be made.

187
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,440

就是来参加就职典礼和舞会而已
Just here for the inauguration and the parties.

191
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,290
我想你已经听说了  我被赶走了
So I imagine you've heard that I'm on the outs.

192
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,950
他们没有说出全部实情
They're not telling the whole story.

193
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,660
发生了什么
So what happened?

194
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,310
我有个熟人
An acquaintance of mine

195
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,670
从国安局偷了机密文件
stole classified documents from the NSA

196
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,300
去了俄罗斯
and took off to Russia.

197
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,060
他们因为这件事责怪我
They're blaming me for it.

198
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,050
你这个熟人带走的是什么
What did this acquaintance take?

199
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,600
问题就是这个  我也不知道
That's just the thing. I have no idea.

200
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,340
要是你能找到他  跟他谈谈
If you could find him, talk to him,

201
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,260
他会告诉你  我和这事一点关系都没有
he would tell you that I had nothing to do with this.

202
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,620
他是谁  他叫什么
Who is he? What's his name?

203
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,060
艾丹·麦卡伦
Aidan Macallan.

204
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,140
他会跟你谈的  他尊重你

告诉他我现在没事

我坚信派遣地面部队

208
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,910
我们就是为了石油去的  别装了

我不否认保护原油供应的重要性

但由我们来盯住

211
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,010

-盯住世界还是石油  -都是

难怪你对南极那么感兴趣

我常会起怜惜之情
I tend to get attached,

216
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,130
但我觉得这让我的工作更加出色
but I think it makes me better at what I do.

217
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,670
你现在关注什么

首先是佩特罗夫和艾哈迈德·艾哈迈迪

你觉得总统会赞同我们的议程吗

230
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,280
"我们的议程"  这么说太自负了
"Our agenda"? That's very presumptuous.

231
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,160
这世界上有些地区

顺说  我丈夫不会受任何人的摆布

因为世间最大的孤独

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,180
恐怖

你怎么看莉安·哈维

281
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,530

Kate, come on.

282

你很憔悴
You look tired.

283
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,960
我现在一周工作八天

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,100
你以前也总是很憔悴的样子
I mean, you always looked tired,

285
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,580
但你现在的憔悴  不那么性感了

286
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,780
抱歉让你失望了

其实我马上就得回去了

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,350
这会儿回办公室有点晚了吧
It's little late to head back to the office, right?

289
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,330
我从上周二起就一直在那边
I've been there since last Tuesday.

290
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,030
说实话
Honestly...

291
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,540
我知道这话听起来有点怪
I know this sounds weird...

292
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,940
但我没有更想去的地方了
There's no place I'd rather be.

293
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,290
你这话的语气真...生硬
The way you say that sounds so... rote.

294
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,880
我说不好
I don't know...

295
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,620
这让我怎么回应
What am I supposed to say to that?

296
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,060
我只想知道你好不好  仅此而已
I just want to know how you're doing, that's all.

297
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,480
我只是关心你  坐在我眼前的这个人
I'm just asking about you, this person I'm sitting with.

298
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,990
你想什么呢  汤姆·耶茨
Where'd you go, Tom Yates?

299
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,310
我找你来着
I was looking for you.

300
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,450
看来找得不够用心啊
Not very hard, then.

301
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,750
我得跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

302
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,980
好
Okay.

303
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,860
我不干了
I'm done.

304
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,520
我不想再写演讲稿了
With the speechwriting, I don't want to do it anymore.

305
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,900
我想回去做我之前在做的其他事
I want to get back to some other stuff I was working on.

306
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,140
没别的意思  我知道写演讲稿也是写作
No offense. I mean, I know writing speeches is writing...

307
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,780
但这不是我真正想做的
but it's not what I really wanna do.

308
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,600
好
Okay.

309
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,190
你确定
You sure?

310
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,760
是的
Yes.

311
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,090
我们会把你调出去的
We'll transition you out.

312
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,030
但你以后再来就得想好借口了
But you'll need to have a reason to be here.

313
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,270
特别顾问  你逗我吗
Special advisor? Are you kidding me?

314
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,660
有猜测说他已经...
There's speculation that he's already...

315
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,100
这不是猜测  赛斯
It's not speculation, Seth.

316
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,910
人们知道马克·厄舍在某种程度上为我们工作
People know that Mark Usher is working for us in some capacity.

317
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,080
-那还不够吗  -把发布写得好一点
- I mean, isn't that enough? - Clean up this release.

318
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,450
突破党派界限之类的
Uh, reaching across party lines, that sort of thing.

319
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,080
-准备好  以防万一  -当然
- And get it ready, just in case. - Of course.

320
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,070
就这样
That's it.

321
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,860
我知道你不高兴
I know you're not happy about this.

322
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,690
他凭什么能赢得那头衔
What has he done to earn the title?

323
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,240
这不是他赢得什么的问题
This is not about him earning anything.

324
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,210
他已经在接触机密备忘录了  
He's already getting classified memos.

325
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,000
她为什么想这样
Why does she want this?

326
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,870
"她"
"She"?

327
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,870
抱歉  我是说副总统
I'm sorry. The vice president.

328
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,580
她想要的是让这个政府成功
What she wants is for this administration to succeed.

329
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,360
而我想要的是你跟他成为朋友  了解他
And what I want is for you to befriend him. Get to know him.

330
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,060
我们要让他以为是他在操控我们
We want him to think he's managing us

331
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,010
而其实是我们在控制他
while we're busy managing him.

332
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,690
她追查弗兰西斯·安德伍德很久了
She has been pursuing Francis Underwood for a long time.

333
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,920
-我不想和她谈  -艾丹
- I don't wanna talk to her. - Aidan...

334
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,510
她怎么知道我在这儿的
How does she even know I'm here?

335
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,950
鲍德温女士是个非常优秀的记者
Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.

336
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,080
把事情公开对你和我都没帮助
Yeah, going public will not help you, or me.

337
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,940
你就跟她说说  你是怎么操纵美国民意的
You'll tell her how you manipulated the American mood, hmm?

338
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,040
-你是怎么偷走大选胜利的  -那我就完了
- How you helped steal an election. - That would be it for me.

339
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,180
你可是我们俄罗斯联邦的贵客
You're a valued guest of the Russian state.

340
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,900
我想要回我的护照
I want my passport back.

341
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,830
美国护照是绝对保护不了你的
An American passport is the last thing that will keep you safe.

342
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,250
我愿赌一把
I'll take my chances.

343
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,900
这下你要出名了  当个告密者
This will make you famous, hmm? A whistle-blower.

344
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,530
我不想出名
I don't wanna be famous.

345
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,370
但你想要自由
But you do want to be free.

346
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,070
你光饭钱就花了一万五
You spent $15,000 at The Capital Grille?

347
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,040
你吃金子吗
What the fuck are you eating?

348
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,950
-这是罗梅洛利用纪律委员会  -这是把柄
- This is Romero using the House Ethics... - It's a liability.

349
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,390
你就不该犯这种错
And you should know better.

350
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,540
这事你怎么没说过  泰瑞
How did you not disclose this, Terry?

351
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,930
我想把他踢出委员会
I want to pull him off his committee assignments.

352
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,870
扔进科学委员会  看他喜不喜欢宇航局报告
Put him on Science. See how he likes NASA briefings.

353
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,300
先缓缓吧
I'd like to hold off on that.

354
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,690
罗梅洛就要成为总统的亲密盟友了
Romero's about to become an ally to the president.

355
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
怎么会呢
And why's that?

356
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,040
因为他能查出你的账单有问题
Because he was able to find out about your tab.

357
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,440
因为他从不轻易放手
It's because he's relentless.

358
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,030
因为四年后亚利桑那州35%的选民是拉丁裔
Because in four years, 35% of the vote in Arizona will be Latino.

359
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,800
因为他就是未来
Because he's the future.

360
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,340
就是这么开始的
This is how it starts.

361
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,060
我得回国会去了
I gotta get back to the Hill.

362
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,430
跟你说  道格
You know, Doug...

363
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,890
你我都待得够久  见过换护卫
you and I, we've been around long enough to see the guard change.

364
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,580
之所以会换人  是因为上头那些人
And it changes because the people at the top

365
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,250
忘了自己是怎么爬上去的
forget how they got there.

366
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,290
罗梅洛也想换护卫  道格
Romero's trying to change the guard, Doug.

367
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,420
而我们就是护卫
And we are the guard.

368
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,180
要是乌麦克议员无所隐瞒
If Congressman Womack has nothing to hide,

369
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,690
那他就没什么好怕的
he has nothing to fear.

370
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,410
我们都有要隐瞒的事  罗梅洛议员
We all have something to hide, Congressman Romero.

371
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,480
领导层该换人了
It's time for a change in the leadership.

372
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,940
总统想当你的朋友
The president would like to be a friend to you,

373
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,580
但你让他很难做
but you're making it very difficult.

374
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,850
我们可以保证移民禁令
We can guarantee the immigration ban

375
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,560
下星期就会取消
will be lifted in the next week.

376
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,350
拜托  又来这一套吗
Come on. Are we doing this again?

377
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,730
你开个种族歧视的条件
You offer me some racist gesture.

378
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,800
我怎么  就当死党吗  本来你也禁不住
And I, what? I'm a friend forever? Ban isn't even sustainable.

379
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,140
你最在乎的究竟是什么
What matters to you?

380
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,700
-总统的注意力  -你有啊
- The president's attention. - You have it.

381
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,300
-全部的注意力  -你过分了
- His full attention... - You know, that's enough.

382
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,210
你到底想要什么
What is it that you really want?

383
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,650
我想要医保覆盖率调回原来的水平
I want Medicare coverage bumped up to where it was.

384
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,520
我的选区有不少退休工人
There are retirees in my district.

385
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,460
你见我就只想要扩大医保吗
We're here now because you want a bump in Medicare?

386
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,430
得了吧  议员
Come on, Congressman.

387
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,850
还有两个就职典礼的座位
And two seats to the inauguration.

388
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,200
-就剩两天了  -讲台座位
- We are two days out. - On the dais.

389
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,080
你的算盘完全打错了
You are going about this entirely wrong.

390
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,110
是你主动来找我  是你求我
You came here. You asked me.

391
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,620
我告诉你
I'm telling you.

392
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,080
我就想看弗兰西斯·安德伍德当着我的面
I want to be there when Francis Underwood says to me

393
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,930
宣布提高医保水平
that there will be an increase in Medicare.

394
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,900
只要他一句话  我就是他铁哥们
He does that, I'm his friend.

395
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,270
那我现在就可以代表总统
Well, I think I speak for the president

396
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,260
告诉你这事根本不可能
when I say that's not going to happen.

397
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,510
斯坦普先生  我真的很钦佩你为他做的一切
Mr. Stamper, I really appreciate all the work you do for him,

398
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,010
但你我都知道我的党团在扩大
but you and I know that my bloc is growing.

399
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,510
我只要求他在就职讲话里说句话
All I'm looking for is a line in his address.

400
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,370
两个座位  一句话
Two seats and a line.

401
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,290
-好大的胆子  -我告诉他基本没可能
- The balls on him. - I told him it was highly doubtful.

402
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,940
我可以再回去正式拒绝他
I can get back to him with a firm no.

403
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,390
或者你可以答应他提一句
Or you could give him a line.

404
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,850
他的保证很不可靠
His promises are unreliable.

405
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,940
我了解艾力克斯  我们在康威竞选时见过面
Look, I know Alex. We met on Conway's campaign.

406
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,580
只要他加入  就一定死心塌地
Once he's in, he's in.

407
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,620
总统先生  我们得谨慎决定要给出什么条件
Sir, we have to be very careful with what we're giving away.

408
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,560
他能给政府带来
He's capable of giving this administration

409
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,800
巨大的困扰
an enormous amount of grief.

410
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,280
他只是想让我们对他示好
He's asking for a gesture.

411
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,150
要我说可不止
Oh, I'd say it's a little more than that.

412
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,130
完全同意  他想找帮我们获胜的人的麻烦
I completely agree. He's going after the people who got us here.

413
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,370
他并没有错  对吗
He's not wrong, is he?

414
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,950
有些领导层的人确实该下台了
There are some in leadership whose time has come and gone.

415
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,260
瞧  我是来确保
Look... I'm just here to make sure

416
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,290
你能连任的
your four years turn into eight, but...

417
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,880
但决定权还是在你手上
it's up to you, of course.

418
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,870
他要的不过是两个座位  一句话 
But we're talking about two seats... one line...

419
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,570
答应他的要求
Give him what he wants.

420
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,110
艾力克斯
Alex.

421
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,500
蒂尔达  很高兴见到你
Tilda. It's lovely to see you.

422
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,350
-你好吗  议员  -挺好的
- How are you, Congressman? - Oh, I'm fine.

423
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,830
很高兴你们都来了  今天是个大日子
It's good of you all to be here. It's a big day.

424
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,510
要不你们坐我的位子
Listen, why don't the two of you take my seats?

425
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,960
谢了  我们已经被安排在走道旁了
Oh, thanks, but we're already on the aisle.

426
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,160
你们务必收下
I insist.

427
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,950
这样总统说到你想听的话时
You'll be right in the president's line of vision when he...

428
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,590
你正好能与他对视
says what you want to hear.

429
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,540
请吧  我在哪都行
Please. I can be anywhere.

430
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,770
好吧
Okay.

431
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,740
-谢谢你  马克  -别客气
- Thank you, Mark. - Sure.

432
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,200
我  弗兰西斯·安德伍德  庄严宣誓
I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...

433
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,560
我  弗兰西斯·安德伍德  庄严宣誓
I, Francis J. Underwood, do solemnly swear...

434
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,930
我必忠实执行...
That I will faithfully execute...

435
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,050
我必忠实执行...
That I will faithfully execute...

436
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,070
合众国总统职务
The office of President of the United States.

437
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,400
合众国总统...是的  这一幕似曾相识
The office of Pres-- Yes, here we go again.

438
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,200
国务卿  那时我是想要这个位子
Secretary of State. That's what I wanted.

439
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,930
我只想要这个位子  也是当时许诺给我的
That's all I wanted. That's what I was promised.

440
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,220
而现在  瞧瞧我
And now, here I am,

441
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,880
成了美国总统
President of these United States.

442
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
美国人民  这是你们促成的  
You made this bed, America.

443
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,110
是你们投票给我的
You voted for me.

444
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,160
困惑吗
Are you confused?

445
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,170
害怕吗
Are you afraid?

446
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,500
因为你以为的梦想成真了
Because what you thought you wanted is now here.

447
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,880
现在你在看着我
And there you are, staring back,

448
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,950
目瞪口呆  一头雾水
slack-jawed, bewildered,

449
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,970
心想这究竟是不是你们想要的
wondering if this is what you actually asked for.

450
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,970
是民主  你们的民主选择了我
This democracy, your democracy, elected me.

451
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,140
如果你觉得走到今天实属不易
And if you think it was hard getting here,

452
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,450
你就能开始明白为了保住权位我会不惜一切
you're beginning to understand what I'm willing to do to stay.

453
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,860
我一眼望向拥挤的人群
I look across at this crowd gathered today

454
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,780
我很清楚他们不是我的支持者
and I know that these are not my supporters.

455
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,320
我看到的是一群脸上挂着微笑
I'm looking at people who are waiting,

456
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,940
等待着自己的机会来临的人
with a smile on their face, for their turn.

457
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,670
那些笑得最开怀
And the most vicious among them

458
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,460
鼓掌最热烈的人  也是其中最阴险的
are the ones who are smiling and clapping the hardest.

459
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,060
权力正如房地产  还记得吗
Power is a lot like real estate. Remember?

460
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,000
-愿上帝助我  -愿上帝助我
- So help me God. - So help me God.

461
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,700
美国人民  我听到了你们的声音
America, I hear you.

462
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,860
我听到了你们所有人的声音
I hear all your voices.

463
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,640
我听到了你们的挣扎  你们的担忧
I hear your struggles, your concerns,

464
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,290
但最重要的是  我听到了你们的希望
but most of all, I hear your hope.

465
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,140
每个人都希望得到机会和保障
Opportunity and security is what we all want.

466
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,160
所以在我上任后的百天之内  我会团结两党
And in my first 100 days, I will reach across party lines

467
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,180
让我的政府  也是你们的政府
and devote my administration, your government,

468
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,780
保障你们的需要
to securing them.

469
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,220
老年人以及他们所依赖的
For too long we have ignored

470
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,250
医疗保险已经被我们忽视了太久
our seniors and the healthcare they depend on.

471
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,020
所以我要致力于改善医保政策
That is why I am committed to fixing Medicare

472
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,930
取得成效前  我不会增加一毛钱预算
before I devote one more dime to the program.

473
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,720
《美就法》只是个开始
AmWorks was only the beginning.

474
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,110
我们得学会不再依赖福利津贴
We have to learn to live without entitlements,

475
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,930
因为我们不是不劳而获的民族
because we are not an entitled people.

476
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,920
我相信你们的每一滴汗水  每一分耕耘
I believe in your sweat. I believe in your hard work.

477
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,110
我今天要向大家承诺的  就是就业机会
And a job, that's what I'll promise you today.

478
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,730
你连一句话都不能给他吗
You couldn't give him one line?

479
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,530
对不忠诚的人我们一个子也不会给
We give no quarter to those that are disloyal.

480
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,070
今天传达的信息不是针对他一人
The message sent today wasn't just for him.

481
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,180
-报仇会燃起艾力克斯的斗志  -我也是
- Alex feeds off of retribution. - So do I.

482
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,650
-他值得你引战吗  -没有中间地带
- Is he worth the fight? - There is no neutrality.

483
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,730
我要求完全的忠诚  不然你就是我的敌人
I expect total loyalty or you are an enemy.

484
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,390
明白了  总统先生 
Understood, Mr. President.

485
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,250
你怎么想
What are you thinking?

486
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,670
{\an9}BGM: My Country, 'Tis of Thee

490
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,090
*让人民打破沉默*
*Let rocks their silent break*

491
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,150
我就是喜欢这些爱国的东西
I have a soft spot for that patriotic stuff.

492
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,750
请伸开手臂  岔开腿
Please spread your arms and legs.

493
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,820
什么
Excuse me?

494
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,450

495

还有  请你脱掉外套
And if you would please take off your jacket.

496
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,120
-我是个记者  -我知道

497
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,300
我住在伦敦时读过你的报道

498
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,330
-我不是间谍  -我知道
- So I'm not a spy. - I know you're not a spy.

499
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,640
现在还有人用那个词吗
Does anyone even use that word anymore?

500
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,750
采访不会在这里进行
So the interview won't be happening here.

501
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,000
-我们说好的  -我们得带你去另一个地方

502
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,550
对不起  你不能用自己的人
Oh, and I'm sorry, you cannot use your own crew.

503
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:03,450
-这不可接受  -那采访就得推迟
- That's unacceptable. - Then the interview will have to wait.

504
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,240
我们不能信任你们的人
We cannot trust your people.

505
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,230
你也不想让麦卡伦先生有危险吧
And you wouldn't want to endanger Mr. Macallan, would you?

506
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,380
你来吗  鲍德温女士
Are you coming, Miss Baldwin?

507
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,490
你的手机得留下
And your cell phone needs to stay here.

支持你的人很多

不管总统说了  或没说什么

有很多人乐意跟你合作

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,190
调查总统

这很大胆
That's bold.

517
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,720
-我并不是想打动你  -很冒险
- I'm not trying to impress you with that. - It's risky.

518

你不想跟白宫的人为敌

但你现在在白宫了

520
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,510

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,420
让我帮你吧
Why don't you let me help you?

522
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,580
不非得让其他人输你才能赢
Everybody doesn't have to lose for you to win, right?

523
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,120
肖恩·杰弗瑞斯在吗
Is Sean Jeffries there?

524

我不明白为什么把我转接给你

凯特·鲍德温的人本来都准备好了
Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go,

544
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,690
但俄联邦安全局换掉了她的人
but the FSB replaced the crew.

545
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,800
你牙上有东西
You have something on your tooth.

546
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,170
我们知道他们要去哪吗
Do we know where they were going?

547
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,580
不  但他们还在受追踪
No, but they're still being tracked.

548
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,090
凯特·鲍德温就不该跟他说上话
Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.

549
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,190
-这采访绝不能进行  -我们还有时间
- This interview cannot happen. - We still have time.

550
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,200
不  没有了

551
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,790
我们得介入
We need to go in.

552
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,290
这可能会产生难以预料的后果
And there might be some unforeseen consequences.

553
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,270
我觉得艾丹不会透露任何
I don't think Aidan would reveal anything

554
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,770
会伤害我  或其他人的信息
that would endanger me... or anyone else.

555
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,290
你跟他的交情有多久
How far back do you and he go?

556
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,990
很久
Far.

557
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,960
仅此而已
That's all.

558
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,430
很遗憾要如此结局
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

559
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,710
我不需要你的同情
I don't need your sympathy.

560
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,150
你快好了
You almost ready?

561
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,810
该死  我找不到我的F了
God damn it. I can't find my "F."

562
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,480
肯定是被人偷了
Someone must have stolen it.

563
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,050
肯定还会找到的
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.

564
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,510
汤姆  你这身礼服真帅
Tom, you look very handsome in a tuxedo.

565
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,230
我装作撑得起礼服的人
I act like a man that can wear a tuxedo

566
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,790
我突然就撑得起礼服了
and suddenly I'm a man who can wear a tuxedo.

567
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,130
先用这个凑合吧
This should do for now.

568
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,040
-我刚看到艾瑞克·罗林斯来了  -是啊
- I just saw that Eric Rawlings arrived. - Yes.

569
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,510
汤姆  我们过会儿在楼下跟你碰头
Tom, we'll meet you downstairs in just a few minutes.

570
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,390
好
Sure.

571
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,120
斯坦普说  我们一小时后就能有
Stamper tells me that we'll have a bead on Macallan's location

572
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,670
麦卡伦下落的线索了
in about an hour or so.

573
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:13,380
我刚跟简·戴维斯说了话  她的联络人准备好了
I just spoke to Jane Davis. Her contacts are ready and waiting.

574
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,600
我们能撇清关系  弗兰西斯
We'll have distance, Francis.

575
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,130
我们会欠她的
We'll owe her.

576
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,070
你很帅  很有总统气质
You look very beautiful. Presidential.

577
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,890
你才美  有副总统的气质
You look beautiful. Vice Presidential.

578
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,170
就是这晚  佐伊被杀的那晚
Here we are. The night of Zoe's death.

579
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,680
你觉得那是谁
Who does that look like to you?

580
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,050
一个等列车的普通白人
Just another white guy waiting for the train.

581
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,760
看仔细点
Look closer.

582
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,450
我知道你觉得那是谁  但我不能确定
I know who you think it might be, but... I'm really not sure.

583
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,010
关上门
Yeah, shut that door.

584
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,550
杰拉德·福特的儿子以前会
Gerald Ford's son used

585
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,700
偷偷溜上这些楼梯  去屋顶
to sneak up these stairs to go to the roof,

586
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,590
跟朋友演奏齐柏林飞艇
play Led Zeppelin to his friends.

587
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,530
少年就是少年  不管他在哪
Teenagers are teenagers, doesn't matter where.

588

这是
And this...

589
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,710
维克多·佩特罗夫摁灭雪茄的地方
is where Viktor Petrov put out his cigar.

590
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,730
那人似乎很不好对付
That guy seems like a real piece of work.

591
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,430
相信我  他的确是
Oh, believe me, he is.

592
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,460
你也是
So are you.

593
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,540
这就未必了
No, I don't know about that.

594
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,200
-你干什么  -对不起
- What are you doing? - Oh, I'm sorry.

595
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
你为什么说对不起
And what are you sorry about?

596
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,750
我以为你想要一样  你并不想要的东西
I thought you wanted something that you don't.

597
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,750
你觉得我想要什么
So what is it that you think I wanted?

598
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,880
我们可以再上去  我真的...
We can go back up. I'm... I'm really s...

599
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,780
据说  人体最脆弱的部分
You know, they say the most vulnerable part of the human body...

600
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,460
是喉咙
is the throat...

601
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,700
你要想真正知道自己对某人的感觉
and that you never really know how you feel about somebody...

602
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,900
就需要那人掐着你的喉咙
until they have their hands around your throat.

603
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,860
告诉我
So tell me.

604
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,610
你现在什么感觉
How do you feel now?

605
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,260
恭喜  总统先生
Congratulations, Mr. President.

606
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,940
以免我忘了  莉安·哈维让我跟你打招呼
Before I forget, LeAnn Harvey wanted me to say hello.

607
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,580
她怎么样
How is she?

608
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,260
她要我告诉你
Well, she wanted me to tell you

609
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,410
她没事  她不会有事
that she's... she's all right. She's gonna be all right.

610
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,410
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

611
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,180
她现在  请假了
She's, um, taking a leave of absence.

612
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,430
至少他们是这么说的
Well, that's what they're calling it,

613
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,710
但看来
but it... it seems that

614
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,620
她被赶出政府了
she's being pushed out of the administration.

615
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,780
是她告诉我你在这儿的
She's the one who told me you were here.

616
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,420
叫我来跟你谈谈
Suggested I talk to you.

617
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,550
莉安雇了你  是吧
LeAnn hired you, isn't that right?

618
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,220
家族朋友
Friend of the family?

619
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,320
对  我们这就开始采访了吗
Yeah, um, are we starting the interview now?

620
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,280
不不  我们就聊聊  但应该就好了
No, no. We're just talking. But we should be ready soon.

621
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,150
对不起  我能...
I'm sorry. Can I, uh...

622
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,230
我们开始前  我能单独待会儿吗
Can I just have a second before we start?

623

我去...喘口气
Yeah. I'm... I'm gonna need some air.

625
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,870
不  我就回来
No, I just... I just need a second, okay?

626
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,810
好啊  去喘气吧
Of course. Get some air.

627
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,970
好
Okay.

628
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,760
我想借你的手机
I want your phone.

629
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,870
我想借你的手机  拿着
I need your phone. Take this.

630
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,750
一通电话
One call.

631
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,720
就一通
One.

632
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,090
喂
Hello?

633
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,800
莉安  是我
LeAnn, it's me.

634
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,380
天呐  艾丹
My God, Aidan.

635
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,980
我知道你有麻烦了  我们这么办
I know you're in trouble. Here's the plan.

636
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,260
拿支笔  记下这号码
All right. Get a pen. Write down this number.

637
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,510
他是个律师  他可以帮你出国
He... he's a lawyer. He can get you out of the country.

638
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,750
等你到了俄罗斯  我就能保护你
Once you're in Russia, I can protect you.

639
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,280
对不起
I'm sorry.

640
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,910
为什么
Why?

641
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,220
他们还有多久会找到我
How long do I have before they come and get me?

642
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,420
他们就在外面
They're right outside.

643
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,400
如果我跑呢
And if I run?

644
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,670
会有人受伤  你不会想那么做的
Uh, people will get hurt. You don't want to do that.

645
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,490
我喜欢德州
I like Texas.

646
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,700
或许是因为阳光或尘土
Maybe it's the sun or the dust,

647
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,580
但人们打招呼时都会眯着眼
but people kind of squint when they say hello.

648
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,010
我一直喜欢那样
I always liked that.

649
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,500
我就不该走的
I never should've left.

650
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,420
你一直对我很好
You've always been very good to me.

我喜欢你妈妈
I liked your mother.

不必
Don't be.

655
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,470
二楼有个守卫是我们的人
There's a guard on the second floor working with us.

656
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,100
他会护送你去个角落  有出租车在等着你
He'll escort you to a corner where a cab will be waiting.

657
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,980
会有人给你开门
Someone will open the door. Just...

658
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,130
上车就行
get in.

659
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,540
你不想念德州吗
So you don't miss Texas?

660
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,410
不  我想
No, I do.

661
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,000
我想获得安宁
I'm trying to find some peace with this

662
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,960
而你在帮倒忙
and you're not helping.

663
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,980
-就再问几个问题  -我要搬走了
- Just a couple more questions. - I'm moving, you know.

664
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,540
-我得到了新工作  -巴恩斯先生
- I got a new job... - Mr. Barnes?

665
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,150
他们将你女儿的死判为意外
They ruled your daughter's death an accident.

666
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,030
我开始有所怀疑了
I am starting to doubt that.

667
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,160
-我们能不能再说一两遍  -知道吗
- Could we just go over one or two more... - You know what?

668
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,430
我不能再这么下去了
I just can't keep doing this.

669
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,630
别再给我打电话了
Stop calling me, please.

670
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,020
采访不会进行了
The interview will not be happening.

672
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,250
总统先生
Mr. President.

673

希望我没来得太晚
I hope I'm not too late to the party.

674
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,200
你正好赶上隆重登场
I'd say you were just in time to make your grand entrance.

675
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,660
这一切开始时  我可没想过
Well, when all this started, I don't think I imagined myself

676
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,390
今晚会跟你一起站在这里

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,030
不用  舞会上见

道格  打扮得真帅
Doug! Don't you look good.

693

谢谢您  副总统女士

694
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,100
你见到弗兰西斯了吗
Have you seen Francis?

695
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,530
好一会儿没见着了  女士
Not for a little while, no, ma'am.

696
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,450
大家在纷纷离开了
Well, the party's breaking up.

697

699
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,760
我有个问题问你  就一件小事
I have a question for you. Just a small thing.

700
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,820
-怎么了  -你怎么没去看砍头
- What is it? - Why weren't you at the beheading?

701
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,230
-什么  -詹姆斯·米勒被砍头那晚
- What? - The night James Miller was beheaded.

702
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,740
我们都在  我们四个
We were all there, the four of us.

703
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,900
弗兰西斯  汤姆  莉安和我
Francis, Tom, LeAnn and myself.

704
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,020

705
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,100
你见到弗兰西斯  就说我找他

00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,950
看我找到了什么
Look what I found.

712
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,350
他们要重启委员会
They're restarting the committee.

713
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,440
我以为我们扼杀了那个委员会
I thought we killed that committee.

714
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,080
众议院什么都野火烧不尽
Nothing ever really dies in the House.

715
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,680
只不过关注的人越来越少
It just plays in front of a smaller and smaller audience.

716
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,900
-这事可不小  -我知道
- This is serious. - I know.

717
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,420
但我们还是好好享受舞会吧
But let's enjoy the rest of the party.

718
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,090
你是做什么的
What do you do here?

719
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,240
我为他们工作
I work for them.

720
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,140
总统让我确保你安全回家
The president asked me to make sure that you get home safely.

721
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,280
我给你安排了一辆车
I have a car for you.

722
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,380
我还想多待一会儿
I thought I'd stay a little while longer.

723
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,150
总统明天早上要早起
The president has an early morning tomorrow.

724
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,230
这边请
Right this way.

725
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,050
那个导游
The tour guide?

726
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,060
-什么  -是的
- What?  - Yes.

727
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,350
搞什么  我应该拿那个导游怎么办呢
WTF. What am I supposed to do about the tour guide?

728
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,090
还在媒体接待室  汤姆  不是吧
The press briefing room, Tom, really?

729
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,890
我以为没人会在意
I didn't think anyone would care.

730
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:52,230
那我是该留下她还是让她走人呢
Well, should I... keep her on or let her go?

731
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:55,960
她这样做是很不专业的
I mean, it was rather unprofessional on her part.

732
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,520
她很擅长她的工作
She's good at her job.

733
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,460
汤姆...
Tom...

734
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,580
不要对我妻子不忠
don't cheat on my wife.

735
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,750
巴恩斯先生
Mr. Barnes?

736
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,740
你想到别的地方喝杯咖啡吗
Do you want to get a coffee somewhere away from this?

737
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,790
我一直在想你说的话
I keep thinking about what you said.

738
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,430
我在她的东西中找到了这个
I found this with her things.

739
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,960
父亲节那天
It was Father's Day...

740
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,690
是我最后一次跟她通话
the last time I heard from her.

741
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,850
我们不是很亲近
We weren't close.

742
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,020
我很惊讶她会打电话给我
I was surprised she called.

{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}美国联邦政府内阁包括副总统在内  目前共24名成员
其中负责国家安全的  如国务卿  国土安全部长  国防部长  被认为最重要
此外司法部长  财务部长也是比较重要的位置
而交通部长  农业部长  教育部长等  被认为是相对次要的职位
但因为现任总统特朗普在竞选时承诺
上任后将进行总值1万亿美元的基础建设投资
所以交通部长在现政府中地位较高
现任交通部长是华裔赵小兰  她丈夫麦康诺是参议院多数党领袖
许多媒体认为  特朗普任命赵小兰负责交通部
除了因她在小布什政府任职时  表现优异之外
也可能是希望在基建政策上获得麦康诺的支持

00:53:30,230 --> 00:54:30,230
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}"医保改革"过去八年来一直是美国政治斗争的核心议题
奥巴马的新医保法案在2010年通过后
就一直遭右翼政客及共和党选民的反对
共和党也借此先后夺回了国会两院的控制权
特朗普竞选时  一再承诺上台后会推翻和替代原有的医保法案
但上任后  实际操作却困难重重  现在的替代法案能否通过尚无定数
同时  现有的医保制度在美国社会遇到了大麻烦
2009年推行法案时  奥巴马称法案通过后  保费会大幅降低
但法案施行后  不仅保费年年暴涨  而且由于医保公司亏损严重
在进入2017年后  美国一些地区的百姓已经无法购买"奥巴马医保"
所以替代方案也是势在必行了
