I don't have the right words for what happened that day.

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,790
但毋庸置疑他是位英雄
But he was a hero, no question.

33
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,290
康威上尉的行为是英勇的
Captain Conway's conduct was heroic.

34
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,330
一位英雄
A hero.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,270
塔利班劫持了陆军上尉克雷格·斯夸尔
Army Captain Craig Squire had been captured by the Taliban,

36
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,300
他被关在坎大哈省
held hostage in the Kandahar province.

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,520
我们发现情报有误
We realized the intel was bad.

38
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,810
我们找到他时  已开始遭受火力
By the time we found him, we'd started taking fire.

39
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,640
那里就像是死亡花园
It was like a death garden or something.

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,910
康威上尉跑下飞机  把斯夸尔救了出来
Captain Conway got out of the plane and got Squire out.

别问我过程有多艰辛
Don't even ask me how.

42
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,880
这次选举太重要了
This election is too important.

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,610
是选弗兰西斯·安德伍德
You have a choice between Francis Underwood

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,900
还是选真正的英雄
and a real hero.

45
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,060
当你滥用"战争"这个词  事情就会变成这样
This is what happens when you throw around a word like "War."

46
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,450
全都乱作一团
All hell breaks loose.

47
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,100
他救了斯夸尔  他救了我们所有人
He saved Squire. He saved all of us.

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,680
战争不是儿戏
War is real.

我不知道我们得说多少遍
I don't know how many times I have to go through this,

51
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,410
但我的竞选团队跟那条广告一点关系都没有
but my campaign had nothing to do with that ad.

52
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,700
是超级政治行动委员会做的
That was a super PAC.

53
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,790
-我知道  但是  -但那些士兵
- I know, but-- - But those soldiers, though.

54
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,360
他们才是英雄
They're the ones.

55
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,450
这个国家欠他们太多了
This country owes them a lot.

56
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,610
-但那条广告成天在播  -你想知道原因吗
- But that ad is on all the time. - You wanna know why?

57
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,840
因为弗兰克·安德伍德没能保护这个国家的安全
Because Frank Underwood has failed to keep this country safe.

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,870
詹姆斯·米勒之死
The death of James Miller,

59
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,720
所谓的哈里发国对东首都电信的攻击
the so-called ICO attack at Capital East Telecom network...

60
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,380
等等  你是说哈里发国不是罪魁祸首
Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying ICO wasn't responsible?

61
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,620
我是说这不重要
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

62
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,420
网络通讯在总统眼皮底下瘫痪掉了
The Internet went down on the president's watch.

63
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,600
-你不觉得哈里发国  -听着  弗莱德
- Don't you think ICO was-- - Now listen, Fred--

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,430
不  哈里发国才是真正的威胁
No, ICO is a real threat.

65
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,650
还有很多人在等
There's a lot of people waiting

66
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,280
说好每个人问一个问题的
and I promised one question per person.

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,580
能跟你谈话很高兴
It was great talking to you,

68
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,920
明天别忘了去投票
and please don't forget to vote tomorrow.

69
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,570
我们进行了多久了
Now, how long have we been going, anyway?

70
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,320
-四个小时  -四个小时
- Four hours. - Four hours.

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
那么还得再战二十个小时
That means we got 20 hours to go

72
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,460
我还没来得及感谢波利跳的朋友们
and I haven't even had the chance to thank my friends at Pollyhop

73
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,010
感谢他们促成了这一切  并直播这一活动
for making this all possible and live streaming this event.

74
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,040
感谢本杰明·格兰特和他的团队
Benjamin Grant and his crew.

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,430
好了  下一个问题是什么
All right. What's the next question?

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,020
安妮  缅因州的安妮  你想问什么
Annie? Annie from Maine. What's on your mind?

77
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,310
弗莱德是我们的人吗
Was Fred one of ours?

78
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,660
我觉得是  我们得继续挑那条广告的刺
I think so. We're gonna keep hitting the ad.

79
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,400
莉安安排好了提问的人  你到了吗
LeAnn's got callers lined up. Are you there yet?

80
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,150
快了  然后再回飞机上
Almost. Then back on the plane.

81
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,440
-我要继续了  -还是在俄亥俄吗
- I'm about to go on. - Ohio, still?

82
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,400
是啊  他看上去怎么样  康威
Oh, yeah. And how's he looking? Conway?

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,720
他才直播了四个小时  他坚持不下去的
Well, he's only four hours in. It's not sustainable.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,880
但他是不是气势逼人
But is he commanding?

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,580
他很傲慢  弗兰西斯
He's arrogant, Francis.

86
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,800
-总统先生  -我得挂了
- Mr. President? - I have to go.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,520
好  葛底斯堡见
Okay. See you in Gettysburg.

88
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,830
你是说  要是安德伍德
You're saying it doesn't matter

89
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,730
知道贿赂的事也没关系
if Underwood knew about pay-for-play?

90
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,090
我是说  那无论如何都不好
Well, I'm saying it's bad either way.

91
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,190
他要么是从他自己党派的人那儿偷来了总统之位
He either stole the presidency from his own party,

92
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,820
要么是在腐败的政府中做了副总统
or he was vice president in a corrupt administration.

93
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,800
但我们应该让委员会做好本职工作
But it's important that we let the committee do its job.

94
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,460
感谢你的来电  安妮
So thanks for your call, Annie.

95
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,970
夏威夷德拉海滩的亚瑟·卡波  亚瑟  你好吗
Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach, Hawaii. Arthur, how you doing?

96
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,100
他们为什么想跟你说话
Why did they want to talk to you?

97
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,250
抱歉  谁  你的问题是什么  亚瑟
I'm sorry, who? Uh, what's your question, Arthur?

98
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,860
约书·马斯特森和扎克瑞
Josh Masterson and Zachary...

99
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,650
我忘了他姓什么  杀害吉姆·米勒的恐怖分子
I forget his last name. But the terrorists who killed Jim Miller.

100
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,990
好  那个
Right. Uh, well...

101
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,390
我只知道他们的一系列要求
All I know is what they said in their list of demands.

102
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,480
他们相信我会当选  成为总统
And they believed I would be elected president.

103
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,600
但说真的  为什么  为什么是你
But really, why? Why you?

104
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,100
我与他们的谈判
I successfully negotiated

105
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,550
成功救出了卡洛琳和梅莉莎·米勒
the release of Caroline and Melissa Miller.

106
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,440
-但没救成吉姆·米勒  -我没得到机会
- But not Jim Miller. - I wasn't given the chance.

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,850
他回答问题的方式  你怎么看
What's your read on him, the way he answers those questions?

108
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,340
-他有所隐瞒  -是吗
- He's hiding something. - Right.

109
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,620
但这无所谓
But it doesn't matter.

110
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,830
他很现代  让总统不那么高高在上
He's modern. He makes the presidency accessible.

111
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,540
你难道不想看到总统候选人通宵连线吗
I mean, don't you want to see the candidate stay up all night?

112
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,390
你是说弗兰西斯老了吗
Are you calling Francis old?

113
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,590
多谢各位热情的掌声  女士们先生们
I appreciate the applause, ladies and gentlemen,

114
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,060
但我知道你们是在为你们想见的那个女人鼓掌
but I imagine it's for the woman you really came to see.

115
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,850
"这是危机四伏的时刻"
"These are dangerous times."

116
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,450
现在确实危机四伏
These are dangerous times.

117
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,360
副总统候选人
...of the United States,

118
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,150
克莱尔·安德伍德
Claire Underwood.

119
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,020
要知道  他只比我大几岁
He's only a couple years older than me, you know.

120
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,090
谢谢  谢谢你们  内华达
Thank you. Thank you, Nevada!

121
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,200
我非常感谢你们一大早来到这里
I really appreciate you all coming out here this morning.

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,540
零售式竞选真是无可替代
No substitute for retail politics.

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,430
尤其是她的形象
Especially her brand.

124
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,070
谢谢
Thank you.

125
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,980
能请你给我拿杯水吗
Could you get me some water, please?

126
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,420
大家好啊
Hello, everyone.

127
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,190
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

128
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,380
谢谢你们  你们真是太好了
Thank you very much. That's very kind.

129
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,410
非常感谢
Oh, thanks so much.

130
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,300
别鼓掌了
Oh, now stop that.

131
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,540
停下吧  别鼓了  够啦够啦
Stop it, stop it. Enough, enough, enough. Enough.

132
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,060
我都脸红了  这么吹捧我
It's embarrassing, all of that adulation.

133
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,790
你好  很高兴见到你  谢谢你能来
Hello, nice to see you. Thank you so much for coming out.

134
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,330
非常感谢
Much appreciated.

135
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,670
-杰克  -演讲很成功  总统先生
- Jack! - Great speech, Mr. President.

136
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,040
你真是把我的心里话说出来了
It's like you're saying what I'm thinking.

137
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,160
这就对了  谢谢
Well, that is the idea. Thank you.

138
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,100
不过话说康威的事有点让我担心啊
Uh, I'm a little worried about the Conway thing, though.

139
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,330
提起了好多问题
Bringing up a lot of questions.

140
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,240
但没得到多少回答
But not a lot of answers.

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,250
我们也不想在大选投票日前一天
Yeah, and we don't need to keep hearing about that article

142
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,530
老提起那篇文章吧
the day before the election.

143
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,420
有什么办法吗
What are we doing about it?

144
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,530
我们聚在这里了  杰克
Well, we're here, Jack.

145
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,170
我们要多握手  能扳回一个算一个
We are fighting back one handshake at a time.

146
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,140
格温多林  你今天真是太美了
Gwendolyn, you look absolutely stunning.

147
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,640
能麻烦给我照张相吗  史蒂夫
May I get a photograph, please, Steve?

148
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,160
麻烦你  千万别把他照进去
Could you do this, please? Make sure you cut him out.

149
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,790
接下来是来自德州科珀斯克里斯蒂的杰弗
We have Jeff from Corpus Christi, Texas.

150
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,280
你今天怎么样  杰弗
How are you doing today, Jeff?

151
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,670
我们看到那条营救行动的广告了
We saw the ad. About the rescue.

152
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,640
杰弗啊  这个话题我前面已经说过了
You know, Jeff, I feel like we have been through this already.

153
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
您救了我哥哥的命  先生
You saved my brother's life, sir.

154
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,690
克雷格·斯夸尔
Craig Squire.

155
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,220
斯夸尔上尉  就是你哥哥
Captain Squire. That's... that's your brother?

156
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,230
上尉
Captain.

157
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,220
还记得我吗
Remember me?

158
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,690
我记得  我当然记得
I do remember. Of course I remember.

159
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,660
我以为你不愿重提旧事
I didn't think you wanted talk about it.

160
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,020
我们挺过来了  就够了  是不是
We lived through it. That's enough, isn't it?

161
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,050
我一直没机会感谢你  告诉你
I never got to thank you and tell you...

162
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,860
斯夸尔上尉  换了你也会救我的
Captain Squire, you would've done the same.

163
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,180
我不知道  我当时在那里
I don't know. I was in there.

164
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,420
他们朝我身上扔尸体  一个接一个
They were tossing bodies on top of me, one after the other...

165
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,290
我死定了
I was already dead.

166
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,670
不对  就好像我已经死了一次
That's not right. It's like I've been dead once already.

167
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,460
但那些尸体  就那么堆在一起
But the bodies... the way they were stuck together.

168
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,270
又那么热  还有味道
And the heat and the smell...

169
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,000
但你还记得你把我拉出来的时候吗
But you know when you were pulling me out, remember?

170
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,340
我其实记不太清楚了
I... I don't remember much, actually.

171
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,060
一切都发生得太快了
It all happened pretty quick.

172
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,790
我知道你听见了
I know you heard it.

173
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,670
你得打断这个问题
You have to get him out of this question.

174
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,720
他不喜欢提这些事  你知道的
You know he doesn't like talking about this. You know that.

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,380
-汉娜  -得了
- Hannah, - Come on, man.

176
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,770
-我们谈谈  -你肯定听见了
- let's talk. - I know you did.

177
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,010
我当时只想尽快把咱们救出去
I was just trying to get us out of there as fast as I could.

178
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,810
克雷格  我们活下来了
Craig, we're here.

179
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,800
-我们挺过来了  -是  可是
- We made it. - Yeah, but...

180
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,100
你得继续生活
You gotta live your life.

181
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,840
谢谢您接我们的电话
Thanks for taking our call.

182
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,180
谢谢
Thank you.

183
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,200
他说的程度还不够  他没让康威...
He didn't call him out enough. He didn't get Conway to--

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,150
听着  他尽力了
Look... he did what he could.

185
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,190
他听到了什么  他那是什么意思
What did he hear? What did he mean by that?

186
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,730
不知道  那是威尔和他之间的事
I don't know. It's between Will and him.

187
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,800
他早就想让威尔出来说清楚了  不过
He's wanted Will to come clean about it for a long time, but...

188
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,690
没能如愿
it didn't happen.

189
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,020
所以  看在克雷格的分上
Which is why, for Craig's sake,

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,820
我们得让他们再连线一次
we need to get them back on the phone.

191
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,050
哈维小姐  你跟了我们几个月了
Miss Harvey, you've been on us for months.

192
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,140
抱歉没能成功  
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

193
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,140
如果这意味着交易取消  没事
If this means the deal's off, okay.

194
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,750
我们总能找个去处
We can always find a place to go.

195
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,930
让我再跟他谈谈  我们可不希望他
Just let me talk to him again. We wouldn't want him to--

196
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,220
天啊  我哥哥经历得够多了
Jesus Christ! My brother has been through enough.

197
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,350
我们不干了
We're done.

198
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,220
请你离开
I need you to leave.

199
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,690
他做得很好
He's doing great.

200
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,270
是吗
Is he?

201
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,150
那广告对我们有好处
That ad's playing for us.

202
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,680
听着  我是同意了
Look, I... I agreed to this.

203
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,630
-但我了解我丈夫  -我知道
- But I know my husband. - I know you do.

204
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,190
那些问题是意料之中的  对吗
And those questions were to be expected, yes?

205
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,910
斯夸尔改了主意是好事
It's a good thing Squire changed his mind.

206
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,060
我们今晚可以调出一些带子  拼凑点什么出来
We can pull some tape and put something together tonight.

207
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,550
明早上放出来
Hit some markets in the morning.

208
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,220
等到了投票的时候
When it's time to vote...

209
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,720
威尔救了他的命
Will saved his life.

210
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,500
太过了
This is too much.

211
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,160
我不想再听到关于那场战争的问题了
I don't want any more questions about the war.

212
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,510
不行的
That's not gonna work.

213
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,610
听着  我可以给你看数据
Look, I can show you numbers,

214
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,570
可以给你看这对我们多有利
I can show you how well it's all playing for us.

215
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,660
我只是说  马克  这是...
What I'm saying, Mark, is that this--

216
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,540
我做这行很久了  汉娜
I've been at this a long time, Hannah.

217
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,110
知道吗  当马歇尔告诉我你有空时
You know, when Marshall told me you were available--

218
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,510
马歇尔和我是老相识了
Marshall and I go way back.

219
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,960
这时机对我们所有人都合适  对吗
The timing is right for all of us, right?

220
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,620
我们非常感激
We're very grateful.

221
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,340
那他就会告诉你  我通常不会
Then he will tell you, I don't get involved,

222
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,390
在这么晚的时候插进来
not this late in the game, unless

223
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,390
除非我知道我能发挥影响
I know I can make a difference.

224
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,500
所以不管威尔和斯夸尔发生了什么
So whatever happened to Will with Squire, whatever...

225
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,540
-不是  -我不想知道  也不需要知道
- It's not-- - I don't wanna know. I don't need to know.

226
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,300
但不管那些事让他承受着怎样的痛苦
But whatever pain he's carrying about what happened...

227
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,640
对我们是有利的
it's working for us.

228
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,890
所以  我需要你
So, this is what I need from you.

229
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,460
回去那里
To go back out there

230
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,970
确保他能撑到明早
and just make sure he makes it through until morning.

231
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,780
他有机会做一个好总统
He has a chance to be a fine president.

232
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,690
一个伟大的总统
A great president.

233
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,370
那更好了
Even better.

234
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,520
因为我们需要这样的总统
Because we could use one.

235
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,930
斯夸尔没出现在那广告里是有原因的
There's a reason that Squire didn't appear in that ad.

236
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,080
我还在确认细节
I'm just nailing down the specifics.

237
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,630
-让道格加入吧  -他在去费城的路上
- Let's bring Doug in on this. - He's on his way to Philly.

238
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,780
而且恕我直言  先生
And with all due respect, sir,

239
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,550
他的技能在这里并不适用
his skill set doesn't necessarily apply here.

240
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,280
你知道道格跟我多久了吗  莉安
Do you know how long Doug has worked for me, LeAnn?

241
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,670
不太清楚
Not exactly, no.

242
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,430
几乎是一辈子了
Well, it's just this side of forever.

243
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,570
我了解他的一切
I know everything about him.

244
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,570
他的优势  他的弱点  他的技能
His strengths, his weaknesses, his skill set

245
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,210
以及他心里在想什么
and the contents of his soul.

246
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,990
希望您不是在质疑我的忠诚
I hope you're not questioning my loyalty.

247
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,200
我只是想了解为我工作的人  莉安
I just like to know about the people who work for me, LeAnn.

248
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,640
-我很坦诚的  -我根本不信
- I'm pretty straightforward. - I don't believe that for a second.

249
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,680
我第一次跟道格坐下来谈
The first time I sat down with Doug,

250
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,390
更像是他的坦白而非对话
it was more of a confession than a conversation.

251
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,030
他跟我说了他酗酒的事  他的过去
He told me about his drinking, his past.

252
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,970
他对我彻底敞开了心扉
He was completely open with me.

253
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,470
我不觉得我们能指望克雷格·斯夸尔
I don't think we can rely on Craig Squire.

254
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,570
那我们还有什么好说的
Then why am I still talking to you?

255
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,780
我没有掩饰内心  先生
I'm not hiding the contents of my soul, sir.

256
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,990
去找凡妮莎·莫里森
Reach out to Vanessa Morrison.

257
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,730
我已经联系总监了
I already reached out to the director.

258
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,310
对  但道格还没有
Yes, but Doug hasn't.

259
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,920
让他去做  你在康威结束他的小节目前
So have him do it and then you come up with something else

260
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,890
想点别的点子出来
before Conway is done with his little sideshow.

261
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,590
关于接下来的演讲
And in terms of what comes next,

262
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,740
我调整了开场白  缩减了正文的篇幅
I adjusted the opening remarks and cut some from the stump.

263
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,170
正文不用改了
The stump is just fine.

264
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,580
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

265
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,720
请给我接第一夫人
Get me the First Lady, please.

266
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,740
这个嘛  简单来说就是
Well, the... the short answer is

267
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,670
在民主体制下  每个人都有相同的权利
in a democracy, everyone has the same rights...

268
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,180
和相同的机会
the same opportunities.

269
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,730
喂
Hello.

270
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,170
我们身边的人知道风险有多大吗
Do the people around us understand what it takes?

271
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,630
我知道康威的声势起来了
Look, I know Conway's getting a bump,

272
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,560
但这不代表接下来的一天里我们不能扳回来
but it doesn't mean we can't surmount it in the next 24 hours.

273
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,740
他们知道我们付出了多少才走到今天
Do they know what we have done to get this far?

274
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,760
汤姆现在就坐在我对面
Tom is sitting across from me right now.

275
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,580
我才不管你对面坐着谁  克莱尔
I don't care who you're sitting next to, Claire.

276
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,840
我们都在拼尽全力  全速拉票
We're all doing everything we can as fast as we can.

277
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,830
我不喜欢  我不喜欢追赶别人
I don't like it. I don't like chasing this.

278
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,210
你下一站去哪
What's your next stop?

279
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,350
-我们20分钟到斯克兰顿  -你得养养嗓子
- We, uh... We're in Scranton in 20. - You need to save your voice.

280
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,730
我们战场上见
I'll see you on the battlefield.

281
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,370
总统怎么样
How's the President doing?

282
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,100
他还把自己当个年轻人
He's acting like he's still 30 years old.

283
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,280
我们都是
We both are.

284
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,200
这是好事  还是坏事
Is that good... or bad?

285
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,000
得看我们是输是赢了
That depends on if we win or lose.

286
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,260
因为我是个老兵
Because I'm a vet

287
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,460
我还是没弄清楚到底怎么回事
and I'm still not clear on exactly what happened.

288
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,450
我觉得具体情况
You know, I think everything

289
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,580
当时在场的士兵已经说得很清楚了
has been said by the soldiers who were there.

290
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,280
不对  你的飞机
No. 'Cause your plane,

291
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,460
是被击落还是按计划去营救
was it shot down or was it a planned rescue?

292
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,280
是计划的
Planned, yes.

293
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,540
但是后来计划不得不调整了
Until the plan had to change.

294
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,570
-我想你懂的  -我不懂  先生
- I think you get the idea. - No, I don't get it, sir.

295
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,920
-你是飞行员吧  -对
- You were a pilot, right? - Yes.

296
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,080
那你为什么会出舱执行地面任务
So why were your boots even on the ground?

297
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,030
我们的情报有误
Our intel was flawed.

298
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,920
情报有误  我只得介入  没办法
Our intel was flawed and I... I had to step in. I had to.

299
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,110
你好  麦克
Hi, Mike.

300
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,350
我丈夫是个谦虚的人
My husband is a humble man.

301
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,980
你是不会听到他那天英勇救人的全部过程的
You're never going to get the details of his bravery that day.

302
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,530
至少他自己不会说
At least, not from him.

303
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,900
在我看来  他的战友说得好
To me, his comrades say it all.

304
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,250
威尔是个有能力应对任何状况的人
Will is a man who is equipped to deal with whatever comes at him.

305
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,600
而现在  我想和你说一件更重要的事
And now, I'd like to put in a word on a more practical matter,

306
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,450
这些新集中选民的投票中心
these new centralized voting centers.

307
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,100
因为最近我们收到了许多来电和疑问
Because we've had lots of calls and questions.

308
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,790
无论你支持哪位候选人
Whichever candidate you support,

309
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,720
你一定要去投票  这至关重要
it's essential that you get out to vote.

310
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,980
搭邻居的车  或者联系当地的党务办公室
Ask a neighbor for a ride or call your local party office.

311
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,180
这场竞选太激烈  决不能掉以轻心
This race is too close for complacency.

312
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,270
我选你
You got my vote!

313
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,760
-安德伍德  -非常感谢
- Underwood! - Thank you so much.

314
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,440
谢谢  谢谢你们
Thank you. Thank you.

315
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,460
太谢谢你们了  谢谢
Thank you so much. Thank you.

316
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,670
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

317
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,030
能麻烦你再给我拿杯蜂蜜茶吗
Could you also get me a tea with honey, please?

318
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,950
-你这样还能演讲吗  -我没事
- Are you gonna be all right to speak? - Yeah, I'm fine.

319
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,870
-听听你的嗓子  弗兰西斯  -别说了
- Listen to your voice, Francis. - Stop.

320
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,960
你这几天一直连轴转地跑
You have been running yourself into the ground,

321
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,490
好几天都没睡了
you haven't slept for days.

322
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,680
要不你给演讲开个头
Why don't you kick off the speech,

323
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,660
然后交给我  我给大家解释
let me take over, and then I will explain to...

324
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,130
解释说总统失声了吗
That the president's lost his voice?

325
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,200
不行  你不能这么说
No, you're not gonna say that.

326
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,960
这么关键的时候  可不能出这种大新闻
We're not gonna have that headline as we enter the final stretch.

327
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,230
尤其那个兰斯洛特似的小白脸在那儿嘚吧个没完
Especially since Sir Lancelot is out there yapping all day long.

328
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,750
我倒不觉得康威是兰斯洛特
I'm not really sure that Conway's a Sir Lancelot.

329
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,920
是吗  那你觉得谁是
Oh, really? Then who would you assign that role to?

330
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,320
吐得我真心疼  过来一下
God, I hate to waste that. Excuse me.

331
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,440
队伍里有个年轻人
There was a young man in line,

332
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,070
在大厅另一边  差不多靠着第二扇门
on the other side, sort of against that second door.

333
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,290
大概一米八
Six foot tall...

334
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,080
-让我们单独说句话吧  -好啊
- Maybe just give us a moment. - Sure.

335
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,190
你能不能试试搞到联系方式
Can you see if you can get some contact information?

336
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,530
要是能的话把他叫出来  谢谢
Or pull him out if you can. Thank you.

337
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,180
我不是想接管  我是说我们应该以搭档形象示人
I didn't mean take over. I just meant let's appear as a ticket.

338
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,940
-"团结还是分裂"  -弗兰西斯
- "Are we united or are we divided?" - Francis--

339
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,250
"就在葛底斯堡这里  最血腥的战役之一"
"Here at Gettysburg, one of the bloodiest battles--"

340
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,720
我会背你的讲稿
I know your speech.

341
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,850
但你能结尾吗  你得知道怎么结尾  克莱尔
But can you finish? You have to know how to finish, Claire.

342
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,320
我十分荣幸地向大家介绍
I have the distinct honor of introducing you to,

343
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,120
如果一切顺利的话
God-willing and the creek don't rise,

344
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,480
美国现任也是下一任总统
the current and next President of the United States of America,

345
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,330
弗兰西斯·安德伍德
Francis Underwood!

346
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,940
谢谢
Thank you.

347
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,000
谢谢  温特斯议员
Thank you, Congressman Winters,

348
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
谢谢  宾夕法尼亚
and thank you, Pennsylvania.

349
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,280
还要感谢我的竞选搭档  妻子
And my running mate, my wife,

350
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,480
挚友和伴侣  克莱尔·安德伍德
and my friend and my partner, Claire Underwood.

351
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,650
跟道格·斯坦普讲话我总是有时间的
I've always got a few minutes for Doug Stamper.

352
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,670
再次抱歉  让你久等了
Again, sorry to keep you waiting.

353
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,640
真的不用给你拿点什么吗
You sure I can't offer you something?

354
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,280
我不喝酒  州长
I don't drink, Governor.

355
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,280
我有苏打水  汤力水
Well, I got club soda, tonic...

356
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,850
你说你会建立投票中心
You said you were going to establish voting centers.

357
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,490
没错  我试过了
I was. I tried.

358
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,970
说出来你都不信  选区负责人
I got pushback from the precinct captains

359
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,180
给了我多大阻力
like you wouldn't believe.

360
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,820
-你说你会派警卫队  -那我也试过了
- You said you were gonna deploy troops. - I tried that, too.

361
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,710
我跟美国公民自由联盟的罗杰·弗兰克提了
I floated the order past Roger Frank at the ACLU.

362
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,910
他跟黑人联盟的巴尼·莱纳德说了
He mentioned it to Barney Leonard at the Black Coalition.

363
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,030
两小时内  我就接到八个怒气冲冲的电话
And within two hours, I got eight angry phone calls

364
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,420
告诉我  要是保护远郊地区
telling me exactly what would happen

365
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,730
而不保护费城  会发生什么
if I chose to protect exurban areas instead of Philly.

366
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,950
你最好别骗我  州长
You don't want to lie to me, Governor.

367
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,520
我刚从巴尼·莱纳德的办公室过来
I just came from Barney Leonard's office.

368
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,360
-你想改口吗  -拜托
- You wanna change your story? - Please.

369
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,890
巴尼会告诉你  他威胁挑起种族暴乱
Barney's gonna tell you that he threatened a fucking race riot.

370
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,870
你眼睛都不眨一下地
You fucking lied, straight up,

371
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,820
对美国总统撒谎了
to the President of the United States.

372
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,710
道格
Doug.

373
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,590
道格
Doug.

374
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,700
-请接巴尼·莱纳德的办公室  -把电话放下
- Barney Leonard's office, please. - Put the phone down.

375
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,110
我是道格·斯坦普
It's Doug Stamper.

376
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,860
对  我需要再找他一次
Yes, I need him one more time.

377
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,080
好吧  挂电话吧
Fine. Hang it up.

378
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,420
我会安排警卫队的
I'll get you your troops.

379
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,400
你想知道真相吗
You want the truth?

380
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,590
不感兴趣  我已经知道了
Not interested. I had that coming in.

381
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,050
结束了
It's over.

382
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,560
安德伍德明天必输无疑  他完蛋了
Underwood's gonna lose tomorrow. He's done.

383
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,750
他一完蛋  你也完了
And when he's done, you're done.

384
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,940
你将一无所有  到那时  你就会消失
You'll have nothing left. And then, you'll just disappear.

385
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,710
感谢你抽时间  州长
Thank you for your time, Governor.

386
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,780
要是想把宾州的
What would it take to

387
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,200
国民警卫队收归政府所管  需要怎么做
federalize the National Guard in Pennsylvania?

388
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,400
总统让我给他找些
The president asked me to get him some information

389
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,920
艾瑞克·罗林斯的资料
about Eric Rawlings.

390
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,530
-谁  -葛底斯堡集会的
- Who? - From the Gettysburg event.

391
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,970
我来交给他
I'll give it to him.

392
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,330
穆罕默德·卡拉比  34岁  叙利亚公民
Muhammed Kalabi, 34, Syrian national.

393
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,020
当地线人确认  他的身份可信度很高
Local assets confirm his ID with high confidence.

394
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,850
卡拉比和哈里发国联系非常紧密
Kalabi has strong connections to ICO.

395
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,780
去年秋天的贝鲁特爆炸案
Bombing in Beirut last fall.

396
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,230
贝鲁特事件一个月之前
A month before Beirut,

397
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,830
在开罗和艾哈迈迪在一起
with Ahmadi, in Cairo.

398
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,900
先生  现在在美国
Currently, sir, there are four Muhammed Kalabis

399
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,340
有四个穆罕默德·卡拉比
in the United States.

400
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,260
其中两个和哈里发国的卡拉比年龄相仿
Two are approximately the same age as the ICO Kalabi,

401
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,470
其中一个三周前从阿富汗经加拿大
and one entered the United States three weeks ago

402
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,980
进入美国境内
from Afghanistan by way of Canada.

403
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,050
他是去看他在田纳西州诺克斯维尔
He's visiting his girlfriend in Tennessee

404
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,780
一家书店工作的女朋友
who works at a Knoxville bookstore.

405
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,060
你为什么告诉我这些
So why are you bringing me all this?

406
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,060
你问有什么选择  先生
You asked for options, sir.

407
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,040
在选举日当天逮捕穆罕默德·卡拉比
To arrest Muhammed Kalabi on election day?

408
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,410
凯茜  要是他告诉当局
Cathy, what's gonna happen

409
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,230
他不是恐怖分子怎么办
when he tells the authorities he's the wrong one?

410
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,770
但那就是在选举日之后了
But that would be after the election--

411
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,110
三四天前也许还可行  凯茜
Well, that might have played three or four days ago, Cathy,

412
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,480
但现在已经太迟了
but now it's too late.

413
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,910
你三四天前就拿到这个了吗
Did you have this three or four days ago?

414
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,420
如果我拿到了肯定会给你看的  先生
I would have brought it to you, sir.

415
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,800
好吧  先这样吧
All right, well, let's leave it at that.

416
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,250
请道格进来
Send in Doug.

417
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,650
国务卿要走了
The secretary is just leaving.

418
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,870
这是斯夸尔营救行动的全部资料
That's all we have on the Squire rescue.

419
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,850
很不幸  还不够多
It's not enough, unfortunately.

420
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,990
先生...
Sir...

421
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,640
马修斯那边  我觉得他不会照办
when it comes to Matthews, I don't believe he'll deliver.

422
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,060
我们夺下主动权吧  我们得保护投票站
Let's take this from his hands. We need to protect the polls.

423
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,720
你不用下命令
The request won't come from you.

424
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,500
你会与这事毫无关联
The way this thing is built, you're nowhere near it.

425
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,760
稍等一下
Hold on a second.

426
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,320
宾州的票数怎么样了
How are the numbers in Pennsylvania?

427
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,390
势头不错  但还在误差范围内  先生
They're good, but they're well within the margin of error, sir.

428
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,380
我们不希望看起来
So we don't want to look like

429
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,730
像是把一支武装国民警卫队
we're shoving an armed unit of National Guards

430
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,900
强加给了吉姆·马修斯  对吗
down Jim Matthews' throat, right?

431
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,860
-对  -巴尼·莱纳德打给我了
- Right. - So, I got a call from Barney Leonard.

432
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,830
你逼得太紧了  道格
You pushed too hard, Doug.

433
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,860
但听着  我们有四年来对付马修斯
But look, we'll have four years to take care of Matthews,

434
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,480
我们会收拾他的
and we will.

435
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,400
但如果有别的办法呢
But what if there was another way?

436
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,970
我敢说  如果大家都坦诚面对自己
I don't think anybody, if they're honest with themselves,

437
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,000
没有一个人会说他真的信任安德伍德总统
can say they truly trust President Underwood.

438
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,580
凭什么要信任他
Why should they?

439
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,500
我们国家面临了如此多的威胁
With so many threats to our country,

440
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,340
现在比任何时候都更得选出...
now it's more important than ever to elect...

441
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,800
四年来重点的偏颇
...four years of misguided priorities,

442
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,100
使共和党变回了追逐私利的党派
backing the GOP into soliciting private and special interests.

443
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,140
你知道吗
You know what?

444
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,050
怎么了
What?

445
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,110
-我想当那种人  -哪种人
- I wanna be that person. - What person?

446
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,640
那种做一个小时就能拍屁股走人的人
The person that does this for, like, an hour and then leaves.

447
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,870
不是那样....
That's not what this--

448
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,630
道格  我的性经历跟你一样久
Doug, I've been having sex for as long as you have.

449
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,230
你打给我的时候  我就是这种感觉
And when you called me, that's what it sounded like.

450
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,460
我就想  "好啊"
And I thought, "Great."

451
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,440
可我来了  你在哪里
But I'm here now. Where are you?

452
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,630
我送你回家吧
I should take you home.

453
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,580
不了
No.

454
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,240
-不必劳烦你  -别这样
- You don't have to. - Come on.

455
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,420
-我自己打车回  -我要送你回家
- I'll take a cab. - I'm taking you home.

456
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,820
你怎么了
What is going on with you?

457
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,980
你说得对  我不该打给你
You're right. I shouldn't have called.

458
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,950
我该回去工作了
I gotta get back to work.

459
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,620
关于新建成的投票站外
Reports are pouring in of protests being staged

460
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,630
发生抗议活动的新闻报道不断涌入
outside of many of our newly established voting centers.

461
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,450
这引出了一个问题  美国人民
Which begs the question, are Americans fed up

462
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,240
是否已经厌倦了政客们无休止的闹剧
with our politicians' seemingly unquenchable thirst for conflict?

463
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,450
一边是安德伍德呼吁正式...
Between Underwood's call for a formal...

464
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,510
想好了吗
Make a decision?

465
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,940
共和党的候选人又都是军人出身
...and the strong military ticket on the Republican side?

466
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,880
巴素·海顿  双份  不加冰
Basil Hayden's, double, neat.

467
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,410
巴素·海顿
Basil Hayden?

468
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,590
我这儿可没有  伙计
You're killing me, buddy.

469
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,830
-你有什么  -布莱特是最好的了
- What do you got? - Bulleit's as good as it gets in here.

470
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,880
那就这个吧
I'll have that.

471
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,950
-女人  -工作
- Woman? - Work.

472
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,620
是啊  没什么是永恒的
Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.

473
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,680
请那边那两位
Those two down there,

474
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,310
还有所有进店的人  花光为止
and anyone else who comes in here until that's gone.

475
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,210
这是给你的
That's for you.

476
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,230
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep.

477
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,310
你的喉咙不舒服吗
Is it your throat?

478
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,100
足够吗
Is it enough?

479
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,920
我们的努力
What we're doing?

480
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,010
我...
I...

481
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,310
是的
Yes.

482
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,510
那为什么我们没有遥遥领先
Then why aren't we farther ahead?

483
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,570
大多数的民调显示... 
Most of the polls have us--

484
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,670
我不相信民调
Oh, I don't trust the polls.

485
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,430
除了极少数外  我不相信任何人或任何事
With few exceptions, I don't trust anyone or anything.

486
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,260
投票没开始前一切都是未知的
We won't know for sure until the vote's begun.

487
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,640
但他们的投票率肯定会降低的
But turnout for their side is sure to be down.

488
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,880
我们今天差点就打败康威了
We almost had Conway today.

489
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,200
但我们确实伤到了他
And we did some damage.

490
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,480
或许我们不知道他在隐瞒什么
And maybe we don't know what he's hiding,

491
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,670
但公众知道他有所隐瞒
but the public knows there's something out there.

492
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,780
他睡觉有时会哼歌
He hums in his sleep sometimes.

493
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,170
哼歌
Hums?

494
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,850
哼什么
Like what?

495
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,660
不知道
I don't know.

496
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,930
听不出来
Nothing recognizable.

497
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,460
他经常哼吗
Does he do it often?

498
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,990
有时哼
Sometimes.

499
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,610
哼给我听听什么样
Do it for me. What's it sound like?

500
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,530
我给你拿点润喉的东西
Let's get you something for your throat.

501
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,440
不用  我没事  你接着睡吧
No, I'm fine. You go back to sleep.

502
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,430
我们明天会成功的  弗兰西斯
We're gonna get there tomorrow, Francis.

503
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,900
我在一场筹款会上
So, I'm... I'm at this fundraiser.

504
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,420
在阿默甘西特海滩的一幢豪宅里
It's a beautiful house on the beach in Amagansett,

505
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:34,360
我和一位美女跳了一整夜舞
and I've been dancing all night with this incredible girl,

506
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,470
我完全配不上她
way out of my league.

507
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,610
但当时很晚很晚了
But it's late, very late,

508
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,960
我是个很负责的年轻人
and I'm a very responsible young man, so...

509
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,200
我溜上楼拿我的外套
I sneak upstairs to get my jacket.

510
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,760
但我没想到...
But lo and behold...

511
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,660
她跟了上来
she's following me.

512
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,280
我看到了走廊镜子里的自己
And I see my reflection in the hallway mirror and...

513
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,360
我浑身冒汗
I'm just sweating like a pig.

514
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,030
心跳加速
My heart's racing.

515
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,820
她从我身后走来
And she walks up behind me.

516
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,040
我转身时
And as I turn...

517
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,700
看到了月光映在她的面庞上
I see the moonlight on her face...

518
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,340
一切仿佛都慢了下来
and everything just slows down.

519
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,610
我们就是这样认识的
And that's how we met.

520
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,850
我和汉娜
Me and Hannah.

521
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,190
很高兴并非只有我还在熬夜
Well, I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one up this late.

522
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,060
总统先生  你有问题要问我吗
Mr. President, do you have a question for me?

523
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,020
不  我没有  但我可以给你个机会
No, I don't. But I thought I would give you the chance

524
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,150
问我一个问题  只有一个
to ask me a question. Just one.

525
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,040
我不确定我想问你问题
I'm not sure I have any questions for you.

526
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,310
别害羞  威尔
Don't be shy, Will.

527
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,610
毕竟  机会难得
I mean, after all, this is a rare opportunity.

528
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,020
只有你和我
Just between you and me.

529
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,820
只有你和我  还有其他今晚
It's just you and me and all the other Americans out there

530
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,400
失眠的美国人
having trouble sleeping tonight.

531
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,560
那是因为他们知道
Well, that's because they know

532
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,690
明天的投票会决定他们的未来
that tomorrow's vote will decide their future.

533
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,750
这就是关键问题  对吧
So that's the question then, isn't it?

534
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,330
未来属于谁
Who does the future belong to?

535
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:15,190
我觉得只有上帝能回答那个问题
Well, I don't think anyone but God can answer that one.

536
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,780
我们只能在此生尽可能地证明自己
All we can do is make a case for ourselves while we're here.

537
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,910
好吧
Okay.

538
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,540
我想问你
Here's my question.

539
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,400
我成功的谈判
I successfully negotiated

540
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,950
让卡洛琳和梅莉莎·米勒得以释放
the release of Caroline and Melissa Miller.

541
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,590
但你插手进来
Then you stepped in.

542
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,260
你没让我完成任务  为什么
You didn't let me finish the job. Why?

543
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,730
你真想让我回答那个问题吗  威尔
Do you really want me to answer that question, Will?

544
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,610
-我不确定你想这么做  -我很想
- Because I'm not sure you do. - Oh, I do.

545
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,180
因为他们知道自己能够占你便宜
Because they knew they could take advantage of you.

546
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,450
他们发现了
They saw it.

547
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:56,350
-怎么说  先生  -他们察觉出来了
- How's that, sir? - They felt it.

548
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,240
无论你在海外遭遇了什么
Whatever happened to you overseas,

549
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,460
你都不必感到内疚或惭愧
there's no reason to feel guilty or ashamed.

550
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,960
我为国尽忠了  我那么做
I served my country. I did what I did...

551
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,630
是因为我别无选择
because it's what I had to do.

552
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,630
不像某些人
Not like some others.

553
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,470
我成年以来一直担任公职  威尔
I've been in public office my entire adult life, Will.

554
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,760
其实我曾与你这种人是同学
The truth is, I went to school with guys like you.

555
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,570
英姿飒爽  心怀善意的人
Good looking guys with good intentions...

556
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,370
跟你一样
just like you.

557
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,600
这是我的真心话
And I mean that sincerely.

558
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,090
我还想让你知道  无论明天结果如何
And I want you to know that whatever happens tomorrow,

559
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,030
我从未质疑过你的意图
I never doubted your intentions.

560
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,710
现在对你来说很晚了  总统先生  休息去吧
Must be late for you, Mr. President. Get some sleep.

561
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,110
恐怕我们俩今晚都很难睡得着
I doubt either of us will be getting much sleep tonight.

562
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,730
谢谢你接听我的电话
But thank you for taking my call.

563
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,140
也谢谢你来电
Well, thank you for calling.

564
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,090
现在只剩下一个问题  一个很重要的问题
Now, there's only one more question, and it's a big one.

565
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,170
只能由你们自己回答
And you're gonna have to answer it yourselves.

566
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,300
谁会成为下任美国总统
Who's gonna be the next President of the United States?

567
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
我知道我会投给谁
I know who I'm voting for.

568
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,710
我想感谢办成这次24小时节目的各位
I'd like to thank everyone who made the last 24 hours possible.

569
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,710
全体技术人员和工作人员
All the... the technicians and crew.

570
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,350
如果我们能像他们一样齐心协力  那我保证
And if we all work together the way they have, then I promise,

571
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,710
我们真的会为世界上最伟大的国家
we will truly make this the first of many, many new days

572
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,950
开启崭新的未来
for the greatest country in the world.

573
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:43,060
早安  美国  天佑美国  谢谢
Good morning, America. God bless America, and thank you.

574
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,660
下线了  好了  各位
And we're out. Okay, guys.

575
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,160
你很棒
You did great.

576
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,500
-你做到了  -是啊
- You did it. - Yeah.

577
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,960
大家都很满意
Everyone is so pleased.

578
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,600
我知道很辛苦  但你挺过来了
I know it was tough, but you got through it.

579
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,920
-我很为你骄傲  -谢谢
- I'm really proud of you. - Thank you.

580
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,830
只是些我需要回答的问题
Just some questions that I needed to answer.

581
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:33,160
我知道  但你做到了  你做到了
I know. But you did it. You did it.

582
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,900
-真棒  -非常棒
- Great job. - That was great.

583
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,540
-很出色  -谢谢
- Amazing. - Thank you.

584
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,610
测试  测试  一  二  三
Testing, testing. One, two, three.

585
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,380
测试  一  二  三
Testing. One, two, three.

586
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,810
稍稍加大增益  混响再强点
A little more gain. A skosh more reverb.

587
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,690
测试  测试  很好  很好
Testing, testing, testing. That's good. That's good.

588
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,370
我想感谢美国人民
I would like to thank the American people

589
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,930
今晚十分踊跃的支持
for their overwhelming support tonight.

590
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,350
作为下任总统  我非常重视这份职责
As your next president, I do not take this mandate lightly.

591
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,150
其实  压力非常大
In fact... it is heavy as hell.

592
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,440
你倒是比安德伍德更有机会胜选
You got a better chance than Underwood does.

593
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,320
你的高跟鞋很高  布莉姬特
Those are very high heels, Bridget.

594
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,570
安德伍德一败选  委员会就会解散
When Underwood loses, the committee goes away.

595
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,430
你的话让我心痛
You're breaking my heart.

596
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,270
我本来还期待
I was looking forward to

597
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,220
听你说说道格·斯坦普的料
hearing what you had to say about Doug Stamper.

598
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,360
我本来也期待跟你说的
Yeah, I was looking forward to saying it.

599
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,790
我是来道谢的
I came here to thank you.

600
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,200
我从网上撤掉了那个
I took it down... off the Internet.

601
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,150
跟你谈这事很奇怪  毕竟
It's weird, talking to you about this. I mean...

602
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,410
你看过
you saw it.

603
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,430
我弟弟本可能看到的
My brother could've seen that.

604
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,090
我会让你想起你弟弟吗
Do I remind you of your brother?

605
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,220
他要年轻[当下]一些
He's a little more present.

606
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,010
我的工作是展望未来
Well, it's my job to look ahead.

607
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,770
祝你好运
Good luck with that.

608
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,380
-非常感谢  -谢谢  先生
- Thank you so very much. - Thank you, sir.

609
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,210
我们拿到了昨晚的数据
We have the overnight numbers.

610
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,320
告诉我异常数据
Give me the outliers.

611
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,010
纽约掉了两个点  新罕布什尔涨了两个点
Minus two in New York. Plus two in New Hampshire.

612
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,110
都不算坏
Both not bad.

613
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,030
我一直不喜欢"不好不坏"这句话
"Half-empty, half-full" is an expression I have never cared for.

614
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,960
你昨晚的电话有作用
The call you made last night, it's helping.

615
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,420
今早登上了头条
We grabbed the headlines this morning.

616
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,750
-道格  -是  先生
- Doug? - Yes, sir.

617
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,920
帮我联系加夫尼的萨莉·安
I want you to reach out to Sally Ann back in Gaffney

618
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,610
告诉我目前的投票率
and get me the turnout so far.

619
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,480
我可以告诉你全州投票率
I can get you the numbers for the state.

620
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,750
我不要全州的  我要加夫尼的投票率
No, I don't want that. I want the Gaffney turnout.

621
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,380
你收到陆续发来的全州数据就给我们
State numbers come in, you give them to us as they come.

622
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,360
任何异常都要告诉我们
Anything out of the ordinary, you let us know.

623
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,990
除此之外  没其他事了  道格
Other than that, we're done. Oh, and, Doug?

624
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,300
-是  先生  -你知道去哪找我们
- Yes, sir. - You'll know where to find us.

625
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,750
你担心我们刚看到的选民吗
You're worried about the crowd we just saw.

626
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,700
不是人数  而是热情程度
Not the size. Their enthusiasm.

627
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,810
我看不见得
I don't think so.

628
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,830
杰里  我得待会儿回你电话
Jerry, I'm gonna have to call you back.

629
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,710
这份九点的投票率是我们票仓的还是摇摆州的
This 9 a.m. turnout in our base precincts or swing?

630
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,880
票仓的
Base.

631
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,580
该死
Shit.

632
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,710
我的数据不同  你要不要...
I've got different numbers. You're gonna need--

633
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,140
我反复确认过了
I did confirm. Twice.

634
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,410
道格  是我  尽快回我电话
Doug, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this.

635
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,570
你只负责车险还是都有
You handle just automobile insurance or all kinds?

636
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,260
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}《双重赔偿》

637
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,120
都有  火险  地震险
All kinds. Fire, earthquake,

638
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,520
失窃险  公众责任险
theft, public liability.

639
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,050
集体险  工业险等等  也即将覆盖
Group insurance, industrial stuff, and so on right down the line.

640
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,000
意外险
Accident insurance?

641
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,120
意外险  当然  迪特里克森夫人
Accident insurance? Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

642
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,860
希望你能告诉我那脚链上刻了什么
Wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.

643
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,400
-我的名字而已  -未请教
- Just my name. - As for instance?

644
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,870
-菲莉斯  -菲莉斯  我想我喜欢这名字
- Phyllis. - Phyllis, huh? I think I like that.

645
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,230
咱们来这段
Let's do this one.

646
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,600
我开车绕着街区来回好多次了
I'd drive it around the block a couple of times.

647
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,160
聂夫先生  不如你明天晚上八点半左右来吧
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

648
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,940
他那时候在家
He'll be in then.

649
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,180
-谁  -我丈夫
- Who? - My husband.

650
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,190
你不是想和他谈吗
You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?

651
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,730
本来是  但是...
Yeah, I was. But, uh...

652
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,680
我都有点忘记我的来意了  明白我的意思吗
I'm sort of getting over the idea, if you know what I mean.

653
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,740
这个州有最高车速限制  聂夫先生
There's a speed limit in this state, Mr. Neff.

654
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,240
每小时四十五英里
Forty-five miles an hour.

655
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,550
-我开了多快  警官  -大概每小时九十英里
- How fast was I going, Officer? - I'd say around 90.

656
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,020
看来你要从摩托车上下来  给我开罚单了
Suppose you get off that motorcycle and give me a ticket.

657
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,200
我这次就给你一个警告
So I'd let you off with a warning this time.

658
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,670
如果我不吸取教训呢
Suppose it doesn't take.

659
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,250
那估计我就得给你一拳了
Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles.

660
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,920
如果我嚎啕大哭  把头靠在你肩膀上呢
Suppose I burst out crying and put my head on your shoulder.

661
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,950
如果你把头靠在我丈夫的肩膀上呢
Suppose you try putting that on my husband's shoulders.

662
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,960
美梦破灭了
That tears it.

663
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,680
我就是没心情
I'm just not in the mood--

664
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,850
不  拜托  这是传统
Oh, no. Come on, it's tradition.

665
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,960
如果道格需要我们  他会打电话的
If Doug needs us, he'll call.

666
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,820
是  但是这次不一样  发生了太多事
Yes, but it's different this time. There's so much going on--

667
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,540
-我知道  就当我迷信吧  -我们在这里
- I know, but call me superstitious. - We're in here.

668
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,660
但我们赢的每一次的选举都会这么做
But we have done this every election we have ever won.

669
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,580
-拜托  -我不确定我是否明白你的意思
- Come on. - I wonder if I know what you mean.

670
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,050
我不确定你是否真不确定
I wonder if you wonder.

671
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,930
那是一个炎热的下午  我还记得
It was a hot afternoon, and I still remember

672
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,500
那条街上金银花的气味
the smell of honeysuckle all down that street.

673
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,980
我怎么知道谋杀...
How could I have known that murder...

674
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,060
有时闻起来就如金银花一般
can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?

675
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,020
也许你就会知道  凯耶斯
Maybe you would've known, Keyes,

676
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,080
就在她提到意外险的那一刻
the minute she mentioned accident insurance.

677
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,230
但我没发觉  我感觉好极了
But I didn't. I felt like a million.

678
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,310
怎么了
Yes.

679
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,780
我回办公室看我是否有邮件
I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.

680
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,240
什么叫并不相符
Well, what do you mean they don't match?

681
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,080
在我的家乡
In my home state?

682
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,590
你和莉安最好马上给我过来
Well, you and LeAnn better get over here right now.

683
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,800
怎么了
What's the matter?

684
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,350
我们今天早上得到的一些选区的数字
There's something wrong with the numbers in the precincts

685
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,310
有些问题  它们并不相符
that we're getting from this morning. They don't match up.

686
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,060
这在南卡罗莱纳从没发生过
It's never happened before in South Carolina.

687
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,770
你没什么要说的吗
Well, you have nothing to say about that?

688
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,910
我相信是搞错了
I'm sure the numbers are wrong.

689
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,690
你才不那么想呢
You don't believe that for a second.

690
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,760
我说不过你
I can't win with you.

691
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,510
不管我说什么
No matter what I say.

692
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,110
你送我回家过几次
How many times did you walk me home?

693
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,110
什么
What?

694
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,860
不知道  大概就几次吧
I don't know. Probably a handful.

695
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,880
不  并不是几次
No, it wasn't a handful.

696
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,960
一个月有18次
It was 18... in a month.

697
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,260
我顺路
It was on my way home.

698
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,040
-你什么意思  -没什么  我正好顺路
- And what are you saying? - Nothing. It was on my way home.

699
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,970
不  不是顺路
No, it wasn't just on your way home.

700
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,550
我们想去艺术博物馆
We tried to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.

701
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,930
-但那儿关门了  那天很冷  -对
- It was closed. It was freezing that day. - Yeah.

702
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,550
-你房间里播着这部电影  -是的
- And this was on in your room. - It was.

703
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,310
我让你吻我  我逼你吻我
And I asked you to kiss me. I made you kiss me.

704
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,140
不  你没有逼我吻你  我想吻你的
No, you didn't make me kiss you. I wanted to kiss you.

705
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,710
不管怎样  我知道我们
And anyway, I knew we were

706
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:29,300
会携手共度余生
gonna spend the rest of our lives together.

707
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,820
是的
And we are.

708
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,630
无论如何  绝不后悔
No regrets, no matter what.

709
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:35,800
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

710
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,600
你那是什么意思  "无论如何"
What do you mean by that, "No matter what"?

711
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,910
-你觉得我们会输  -不
- You think we're gonna lose? - No!

712
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,560
不
No.

713
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,290
我们是一起的吗
Are we together?

714
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,200
是的  我们是一起的  无论如何
Yes, we're together. No matter what--

715
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,350
不  没有"无论如何"  我们是一起的吗
No, not "No matter what." Are we together?

716
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,040
我们是一起的  弗兰西斯
We're together, Francis.

717
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,260
那就再不要跟我提起失败了
Then don't ever bring up losing around me again.

718
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,910
-是那个男孩  -谢谢  凯耶斯先生
- That's the boy. - Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

719
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,330
这是家什么公司
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?

720
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,290
我们是保险公司
Are we an insurance company

721
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:16,880
还是一群给那种白痴
or just a bunch of dim-witted amateurs

722
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,220
开保单的弱智
to write a policy on a mug like that?

723
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,800
等一下  凯耶斯  他不是我评估的
Now, wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef.

724
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,170
费城的投票率比他们说的要低
The turnout in Philly is lower than they're saying.

725
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,870
-低多少  -我们的关键选区低30%
- How much lower? - 30% in our key precincts.

726
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,800
30  怎么会这样
Thirty? How?

727
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,520
不只是宾州  大家都没来投票
It's not just Pennsylvania. People aren't voting.

728
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,820
他们的人  我们的人
Their people, our people.

729
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,600
等等  如果康威拿下了宾州
Wait. If Conway's got Pennsylvania,

730
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,640
那他也会拿下俄亥俄
then he's got Ohio.

731
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,660
如果他拿下俄亥俄  我们就输了
If he's got Ohio, then we lose.

732
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,530
-这是怎么发生的  -我去告诉他们
- How did this happen? - I'll tell them.

733
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,420
这件事不用你做
That is one thing you are not doing.

734
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,480
都办妥了
That was all there was to it.

735
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,990
没有疏忽  没有忽略
Nothing had slipped, nothing had been overlooked.

736
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,830
没有什么会暴露我们
There was nothing to give us away.

737
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,340
然而  凯耶斯
And yet, Keyes,

738
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,760
当我沿街走去药店时
as I was walking down the street to the drugstore,

739
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,170
我突然意识到一切都会出错
suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong.

740
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,870
这听起来有点疯狂  凯耶斯
It sounds crazy, Keyes,

741
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,630
但这是真的  帮我
but it's true, so help me.

742
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,150
我甚至听不到自己的脚步声
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.

743
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,800
就好像一具行尸
It was the walk of a dead man.

744
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,980
那是我度过最长的一夜  凯耶斯
That was the longest night I ever lived through, Keyes.

745
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,810
第二天事情见报后  就更糟了
And the next day was worse when the story broke in the papers.

746
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,990
他们开始在办公室里谈论
They started talking about it at the office.

747
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:21,440
第三天  你开始调查
And the day after that, when you started digging into it.

748
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,270
我一直把手揣在口袋里
I kept my hands in my pockets

749
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,500
因为我以为它们在颤抖
because I thought they were shaking.

750
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,580
我戴了深色眼镜好让别人看不到我的眼睛
I put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes,

751
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,330
然后我又把眼镜摘了
then I took them off again

752
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,520
他们就不会好奇我为什么要戴了
so they wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

753
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,760
-我努力想振作起来  但是...  -谢谢
- I tried to hold myself together but... - Thank you.

754
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,670
我能感觉到我的神经在崩溃
...I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces.

755
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,840
给我接南卡罗莱纳
Get me Sally Ann

756
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,460
切诺基县书记官萨莉·安
in the Cherokee County clerk's office in South Carolina.

757
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,640
我等着
I'll hold.

758
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,640
他们把宾州的投票率高估了30%
They overestimated the turnouts in Pennsylvania by 30%.

759
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:01,740
你好啊
Hi, y'all.

760
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,380
不要叫我"阁下"
Well, now, do not call me "Sir."

761
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,580
我是弗兰西斯·安德伍德
This is Francis Underwood.

762
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,540
我们认识这么久了  不用来这套
We've known each other too long for that.

763
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,360
那么  萨莉  今天的投票率怎么样
So, Sally, how was turnout today?

764
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,590
我就想知道切诺基郡的数据
Well, I was just really actually looking for Cherokee County.

765
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,580
是的  我只是想亲耳听到
Yes, I just wanted to hear it for myself.

766
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,670
很好  谢谢
Great. Thank you.

767
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,170
代我们跟亨利和孩子们问好
And we send our love to Henry and the boys.

768
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,030
再见
Goodbye.

769
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,180
-有点低  -你说"低"是什么意思
- It's low. - What do you mean, "low"?

770
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,300
就是很低
Low.

771
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,360
我刚在想那条脚链
I was thinking about that anklet.

772
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,600
你现在在想什么
And what are you thinking about now?

773
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,220
我不想再想了  宝贝
I'm all through thinking, baby.

774
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,580
我只是过来说再见
I just came to say goodbye.

775
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,750
再见  你要去哪
Goodbye? Where are you going?

776
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,250
要走的是你  宝贝  不是我
You're the one that's going, baby. Not me.

777
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:16,240
我要在这个街角下电车
I'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.

778
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,140
别卖关子了  不管是什么  直说吧
Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's have it, whatever it is.

779
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,500
好吧  我来告诉你
All right, I'll tell you.

780
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,910
我一个朋友有个有趣的理论
Friend of mine's got a funny theory...

781
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,400
你知道这意味着什么  是吧
You know what this means, don't you?

782
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,300
这是我们的地盘
This is our house.

783
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,300
我们绝不会离开
We are not leaving.

784
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,070
终点站是个墓地
The last stop's a cemetery.

786
00:50:34,130 --> 00:51:34,130
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}南北战争后  联邦政府就开始大规模  系统地向退伍军人提供一系列福利
相关的行政部门经过多次重组  从1930年的胡佛政府开始
退伍军人相关的福利发放工作  统一由"退伍军人部"负责
1944年由富兰克林·罗斯福签署的《士兵法案》  几经修改
目前仍是向退伍士兵提供福利的最重要的一个联邦法案
2017年特朗普政府提交的预算草案中  退伍军人部的预算为1823亿美元
而且美国公众对军人也非常尊敬  他们享受很多优待  优惠和优先
但许多军人从战场上归来后  无法适应普通人的生活
发展出精神或心理上的疾病  出现酗酒  吸毒等问题  甚至自杀
而退伍军人部作为一个庞大的联邦机构  运作效率低下  官僚之风盛行
屡屡爆出丑闻后  在官僚体制下  一些相关的责任人却未得到惩处
2017年4月27日  美国总统特朗普签署行政命令
在退伍军人部内成立一个新机构  加强对相关事务的监管
