真希望我能让你改主意  凯茜
I really wish I could have changed your mind, Cathy.

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,870
-我...  -因为
- I just... - Because, you know...

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,250
这对你实在没好处
you know, this is just not good for you.

19
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,770
跟委员会的谈判
The negotiations with the committee

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,060
实在还太远
are just too far down the road.

21
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,830
你答应见我是因为你聪明
Well, you agreed to see me because you're smart.

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,150
因为你是该有所疑虑
Because doubt is what you should be having.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,780
凯茜  我尊敬你
Look, Cathy, I respect you.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,640
否则我们也不会在一起这么久了
We wouldn't have lasted as long together if I didn't.

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,110
我丈夫在等我呢
My husband's waiting for me.

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,550
但你会出丑的
But you're gonna be made to look a fool.

27
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,250
没必要侮辱我  弗兰西斯
There's no need to insult me, Francis.

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,960
会有一堆证人反驳
Witness after witness is gonna rebut

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,150
你要说的一切
whatever you have to say.

30
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,120
我的证词就是那样
My testimony is what it is.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,060
公众舆论会自有公断
It'll all be resolved in the court of public opinion.

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,300
是啊  但公众会信谁呢
Yes, but who is the public going to believe?

33
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,070
你  还是恐怖分子电脑上的爆炸物残留
You or explosive residue on a terrorist's computer?

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,860
凯茜  你的证词会看上去像小气的报复
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem petty and vengeful.

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,370
那你会怎么样啊  还有什么前途
And then where is that gonna leave you? What prospects?

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,630
太迟了
It's too late.

37
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,030
-你得栽一跟头  -什么
- You need to take a fall. - Excuse me?

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,680
委员会得等等
Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,860
反正再过两周这都会过去
In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway,

40
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,930
你就站错队了
and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.

41
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,050
-走着瞧吧  -是啊
- Well, we'll see. - Yes, we will.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,450
你先请
After you.

43
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,020
但我的话是真心的  凯茜
But I meant what I said, Cathy.

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,260
凯茜
Cathy?

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,680
凯茜
Cathy?

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,230
救命  救命  国务卿摔倒了
Help! Help! The secretary has fallen!

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,050
你真走运
You're a lucky bastard.

48
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,410
直到今晚结束时才是
Oh, not until the end of the night.

49
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,980
或者该说早上了
Or should I say, the morning.

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,730
凯瑟琳·杜兰特摔倒了  怎么回事
Catherine Durant fell? How?

51
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,980
人会摔倒  就这么简单
Well, people fall. That's what they do.

52
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,420
是啊  在需要的时候
Yes, they fall when they need to.

53
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,930
你的新朋友还是会被弹劾的
Your new friend is still gonna get impeached.

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,680
希望到时候
Well, I hope I can still count on

55
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,170
参议员还是会支持我
the good senator's support when the time comes.

56
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,860
你很会打牌  马克
You're a good card player, Mark.

57
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,260
你从不在牌桌上谈公事
You never talk shop at the table.

58
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,570
总是提款的时候才说
It's always when you're cashing out.

59
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,340
我妈妈教得好
Well, my mother raised me well.

60
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,410
票数让参议员越来越难做了
The numbers are getting harder and harder for the senator.

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,320
-为什么  -资金流入  电话打来
- Why is that? - The money and the calls coming in.

62
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,220
一个数字减少  另一个就增多
One number goes down, and the other one goes up.

63
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,440
参议员受到了压力  来自哪里
The senator's feeling the heat, from where?

64
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,420
你回头再来吧  我们到时谈
Why don't you come in later. We can talk about it then.

65
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,590
不不  等一下
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

66
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,450
丹尼  我指着他的票呢
Danny... I'm counting on his vote.

67
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,830
-那别指望了  -不行
- Well, you can count it out. - No. No...

68
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,040
半数民主党都是如此
And half of the Democrats as well.

69
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,040
别去想什么警告了  众议院还未就
Forget about censure, the House hasn't even voted yet

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,110
弹劾状表决呢
on articles of impeachment.

71
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,200
你不是唯一在做参议院工作的人
You're not the only one working the Senate.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,850
-有人想赶走弗兰西斯  -我问是谁
- Someone wants Francis out. - And I'm asking you who.

73
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,790
你混了很久了
You've been around a long time.

74
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,160
没人会告诉你怎么投票
Nobody tells you how to vote.

75
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,840
只会说你不听他们的会有什么下场
They just tell you what happens if you don't go their way.

76
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,260
石油每桶50美元
Oil's at $50 a barrel.

77
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,970
没人对此满意
Nobody's happy with that.

78
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,480
我们本打算今天对司法委员会
We were hoping to bring you live coverage

79
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,230
听证会进行直播
of the judiciary hearing today.

80
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,290
但由于杜兰特国务卿
But given the postponement

81
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,980
意外地无法出席  而使听证会延期
due to Secretary Durant's unexpected absence,

82
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,860
我们将改为
we'll be switching to

83
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,100
转播军事委员会的会议
the Armed Services Committee meeting instead,

84
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,970
-女士  -多位军队高官
- Ma'am? - where several top military officials...

85
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,930
将报告哈里发国愈增的威胁
...are citing the increased threat of ICO...

86
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,210
今天的日程
Today's schedule.

87
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,690
我觉得您会想看这个
And I thought you might wanna see this.

88
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,390
是汤姆·耶茨的信
It's a note from Tom Yates.

89
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,040
另外
Oh, and reminder,

90
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,650
我们得继续士兵康复项目
we have to get back to the Soldier Recovery Project.

91
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,800
和平
Peace.

92
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,280
那是我们的目标
That's our goal.

93
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,860
通过和平  我们得找到新的前进之途
And through peace, we must find a different way forward.

94
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,340
伊斯玛特上校是民主派领袖
Colonel Ismat is the leader of the Democratic faction,

95
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,510
竭力解放叙利亚人民
dedicated to freeing the Syrian people.

96
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,730
由于杜兰特国务卿暂时无法继续工作
And since Secretary Durant is temporarily sidelined,

97
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,970
我今天要暂代她  因为美国政府
I'm stepping in today because the American government

98
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,610
支持一切迈向稳定的坚实脚步
supports any concrete steps toward stability.

99
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,810
如果得到确认  叙利亚冲突中
If it is determined that chemical or biological weapons

100
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,210
用到了生化武器
have been used in the Syrian conflict,

101
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,620
那么从此刻起
then from this moment forward,

102
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,100
美国将有道德义务插手
the United States will be morally obligated to intervene.

103
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,970
所以  叙利亚总统算就此得到警告了
So, the Syrian president should consider himself on notice.

104
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,410
总统先生  鉴于众议院
Mr. President, given the potential outcome

105
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,980
可能提交弹劾状
that the House will affirm articles of impeachment,

106
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,890
现在插手中东冲突合适吗
is this the right time to wade into a Middle Eastern conflict?

107
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,860
这个问题与主题无关  但我还是回答吧
Well, the question's off subject, but I'll answer it.

108
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,250
首先  投票就不会进入参议院
First of all, the vote is never gonna get to the Senate.

109
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,570
这只是毫无意义的党争闹剧
It's a senseless partisan circus.

110
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,000
我的关注点是做好我的工作
My focus is to remain doing my job,

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,410
也就是确保美国人民繁荣富强
which is to ensure prosperity for the American people,

112
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,300
并努力实现
and to try to achieve...

113
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,930
对不起  和平怎么说的来着
I'm sorry, how did you say it again? Peace?

114
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,910
-和平  -和平
- Salam. - Salam...

115
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,520
这就是我们在努力争取的  和平
That's what we're trying to broker here. Salam.

116
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,060
我们给总统和伊斯玛特上校时间会面吧
So let's give the president time to meet with Colonel Ismat.

117
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,000
我会在媒体接待室接受提问
I'll take follow-up questions in the press briefing room.

118
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,570
或许我太没想象力  但那就是夜晚的大海啊
Maybe I'm being too literal, but that's the sea at night.

119
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,940
-你喜欢吗  -我更喜欢红的
- Do you like it? - I prefer the reds.

120
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,040
我在泰特现代艺术馆看过他的展出
I... I saw a show of his at the Tate Modern.

121
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,510
但我无法把人和艺术品分开
I have trouble separating the man from the art, though.

122
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,110
他是个压抑的人  你肯定也知道
He was, uh, depressive, as I'm sure you know.

123
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,920
你能看出他在抵抗心魔
You can see him fighting his demons.

124
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,800
纳泽先生到了
So Mr. Nasser has arrived?

125
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,180
到了  在四季酒店等我的电话
Uh, here and waiting for my call at the Four Seasons.

126
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
我就是觉得这恐怕不好
Well, I just... I don't think it's a good idea

127
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,720
我们政府的一位成员
for anyone in our administration

128
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
去见哈里发国的成员
to be meeting with a member of ICO.

129
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,820
他不是成员
He's not a member.

130
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,300
他跟尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪是同学
He went to school with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

131
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,010
他是律师  他代理人和组织
He's a lawyer. He represents people, organizations.

132
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,270
-就一个组织  -而且他是要见我
- One organization, to be exact. - And he's meeting with me.

133
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,720
为什么有这样的犹豫
Where is all this hesitation coming from?

134
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,720
对不起  我头好疼
I'm sorry. I just have a splitting headache.

135
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,030
胡蔓藤
Gelsemium.

136
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,970
治偏头痛的  我经常犯
For migraines. I get them all the time.

137
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,510
是中药
It comes out of China.

138
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,710
别担心  是草药
But don't worry, it's herbal.

139
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,400
但你得注意用量
You have to be careful of the dosing, though.

140
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,930
就两滴
Just two drops.

141
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,960
我看到的是纯粹的感觉
You know, it's pure feeling for me.

142
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,670
光明对黑暗
Light versus dark.

143
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,050
和他们的交界线
And that line where they meet.

144
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,580
总统根本不知道
The president had no idea.

145
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,020
你跟麦卡伦先生很亲密
You were close to Mr. Macallan?

146
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,880
是的  但那不代表我知道他的企图
Yes, but that doesn't mean that I knew what he was up to.

147
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,620
那你怎么知道总统与此无关
But then how do you know the president wasn't involved?

148
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,740
我是最后见到艾丹的人  他向我坦白了
I was the last person to see Aidan. He confessed to me.

149
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,650
他秘密利用了国安局和外国情报监视法法庭
He secretly used the NSA, FISA,

150
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,530
操纵了选民
to manipulate the electorate.

151
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,980
我们要会见律师
We're meeting with counsel

152
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,640
打磨剩下的证词
to perfect the rest of the testimony.

153
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,570
只要没人能拿出驳斥你的证据就行
As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.

154
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,910
不会有的
No one does.

155
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,990
回来的感觉好吗  莉安
Does it feel good to be back, LeAnn?

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,230
是的  谢谢

157
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,340
我知道克莱尔很高兴

158
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,670
你能回到她办公室

159
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,580
副总统的会面
Will you let me know as soon

160
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,300
一结束你就告诉我
as  the vice president's meeting is done?

161
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,230
好  先生
Yes, sir.

162
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,960
我讨厌她回来  她撒谎
I hate having her back. She's a liar.

163
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,380
你觉得麦卡伦给了她什么做保险吗
You think Macallan gave her something for insurance?

164
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,500
她不肯承认  但是的  我觉得有
She won't admit it. But, yeah, I think he did.

165
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,770
等委员会启动后  让她去作证吧
Let's get her in front of that committee when they're up and running.

166
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,450
到时她就必须决断了
Then she'll have to make a choice.

167
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,460
格林有些不敢作证
Green is hesitant to testify.

168
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,080
要不是我知道
You know, if I didn't know better,

169
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,600
我会以为他是泄密者呢
I'd think he was the leak.

170
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,690
他知道的信息
He has far more information

171
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,120
实在太多了
than anyone should be comfortable with.

172
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,490
另外理查德森参议员还没回我电话
Also, Senator Richardson hasn't called me back.

173
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,290
上校  抱歉刚刚不得不走开
Colonel, my apologies for the interruption.

174
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,610
我想向你保证  你的担忧就是我的担忧
And I want to assure you that your concerns are my concerns.

175
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
艾哈迈迪兄弟
The Ahmadi brothers...

176
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,780
他们所想的激进伊斯兰是维持不下去的
their idea of radical Islam is unsustainable.

177
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,070
纳泽代表了厌倦了死亡的哈里发国分子
Nasser represents members of ICO who are tired of death.

178
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,530
他们基本上控制了
They essentially control

179
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,010
多个油田和多家精炼厂
numerous oil fields and several refineries.

180
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,840
纳泽已经见过了叙利亚总统

181
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,370
还有佩特罗夫的外交部长
And Petrov's minister of foreign affairs.

182
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,070
他想做个交易
He's looking for a deal.

183
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,580
他们想在这个十年内成为
They wanna be a corporation trading on the Dow

184
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,390
上市公司
before the decade is over.

185
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,540
他们想加入石油输出国组织
They wanna be a part of OPEC.

186
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,610
那么伊斯玛特上校和叙利亚人民呢
So where does that leave Colonel Ismat and the Syrian people?

187
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,620
能保命  只要我们调兵
Alive... once we're on the ground.

188
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,900
是啊  但俄罗斯已被请去  我们需要理由
Yes, but Russia was invited in. We need cause.

189
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,530
叙利亚总统用毒气对付了人民
The Syrian president has gassed civilians.

190
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,260
他还会再那么做的  我敢保证
He will again. I can guarantee it.

191
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,290
伊斯玛特上校会确保这一点
Colonel Ismat will make sure of it.

192
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,110
他会在政权内部煽动袭击
He'll instigate an attack from the regime.

193
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,900
我们派部队过去  不动哈里发国的资源
We put troops on the ground, leave ICO resources alone...

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,450
纳泽会确保他们配合
and Nasser will make sure they cooperate.

195
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,660
怎么了
What is it?

196
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,800
你担心他会被弹劾吗
Are you afraid he's gonna be impeached?

197
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,700
因为  他很可能会的
'Cause there's a good chance that he will be.

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,540
这就是你想等的原因吗  因为
Is that why you wanna wait? 'Cause...

199
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,900
我可以推迟一切
I can make it all wait.

200
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,030
戴维斯女士和我的谈话很有成效
Ms. Davis and I had a very productive talk.

201
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,300
我告诉了她
I let her know that

202
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,300
我们的插手是以艾哈迈迪的被捕为交换条件的
our involvement is contingent on the delivery of Ahmadi.

203
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,800
是啊  但我能采取行动的时间
Yes, but the window is closing for me

204
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,440
越来越少了
to be able to act on this.

205
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,590
司法委员会可不会等
Judiciary's not gonna wait.

206
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,630
想要这个起作用  时不我待
For this to be effective, it has to be now or never.

207
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,900
我会让她联络纳泽先生
I'll have her reach out to Mr. Nasser.

208
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,890
那另一件事呢
And, uh, what about the other matter?

209
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,130
莉安吗
You mean LeAnn?

210
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,190
戴维斯女士今天下午会跟她谈
Ms. Davis will speak to her later this afternoon.

211
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,260
你听到总统的话了
You heard the president.

212
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,750
我还在白宫

215
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,710
-我跟...  -嗯  我知道你是谁

216
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,540
肖恩
Sean...

217
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,630
我知道汤姆·汉默施密特在查什么
I know what Tom Hammerschmidt is working on.

218
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,750
杰弗瑞斯先生  如果你想预约  我可以安排
Mr. Jeffries, if you need an appointment, I can arrange one...

219
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,200
先生  我只想占用您片刻时间
Sir, if I could. Just a moment of your time.

220
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,810
是机密
It's confidential.

221
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,300
如果你不介意  我们想用一下这个房间
Oh, if you don't mind, we'd like this room for a moment.

222
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,580
给你30秒  但你开始前
You have 30 seconds. But before you start,

223
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,150
是我错了吗  格雷森先生不是你的上级吗
am I mistaken, or is Mr. Grayson your superior?

224
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,090
是的  对不起  但是
Yes, I'm sorry, but...

225
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,520
汤姆认为  道格·斯坦普和您  先生
Tom thinks Doug Stamper and yourself, sir,

226
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,920
跟佐伊·巴恩斯之死有关

227
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,100
汉默施密特先生得到了一部
And Mr. Hammerschmidt has a phone

228
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,330
有人给巴恩斯小姐的手机
that was given to Ms. Barnes.

229
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,140
手机只打过一个号码  是您的号码
It called only one number, and that number was yours.

230
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,130
看来这个号码
Now, it seems that number

231
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,350
在她死时带的手机里也有
has shown up on the phone that she died with.

232
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,180
虽然手机受损  但现在有技术
It was damaged, but there's technology now

233
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,520
可以让他们获取她死前
that will give them access to the data

234
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,070
手机上的数据
leading up to the day of her death.

235
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,220

236
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,990
都在上面
It's all there.

237
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
你什么时候开始为我们工作的
When did you start with us?

238
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,690
一周前
A week ago.

239
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,300
是副总统让你加入的
And it was the vice president who brought you on?

240
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,390
是的
That's correct.

241
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,030
一周
A week...

242
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,520
你已经
and you're already having

243
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,910
跟总统谈机密了
confidential conversations with the president.

244
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,970
是的
I am.

245
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,680
如果你再听到别的消息  直接来找我
If you hear anything else, you come directly to me.

246
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,050
是  先生
Yes, sir.

247
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,560
不管你怎么说  这是伪证罪
Whatever you say it is, it's perjury.

248
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,050
伪证
Oh, perjury, huh?

249
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,590
这是你的底线吗
That's where you draw the line?

250
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,210
我不干了
I'm done.

251
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,910
案子已经准备好了
The case has already been prepared.

252
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,340
穆罕默德·卡拉比的电脑上找到了熵炸药
TATP was found on Muhammed Kalabi's computer.

253
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,370
杜兰特国务卿怎么想根本不重要
It doesn't matter what Secretary Durant believes or not.

254
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,130
一个是推测  一个是事实
One is speculation, and the other is fact.

255
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,180
事实  是吗  那是事实吗
Fact? Really? Is that what it is?

256
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,190
如果听上去像事实  那就是事实
If it sounds like a fact, then it is a fact.

257
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,920
卡拉比键盘上有爆炸残留物
Kalabi had explosive residue on his keyboard.

258
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
你知道联调局其他人都受够总统了
You know the rest of the bureau is done with the president.

259
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,230
我没跟他们说话  我在跟你说话
I'm not talking to them. I'm talking to you.

260
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,920
他们都睁一只眼闭一只眼  但还能持续多久
They've looked the other way, but for how much longer?

261
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,040
道格  他完了
Doug... he's done.

262
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,130
那我怎么办
Where does that leave me?

263
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,340
这就是我们在谈的
That's what we're discussing right now.

264
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,480
你知道总统怎么想吗
Do you know what the president thinks?

265
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,560
他觉得你是泄密者
He thinks you're the leak.

266
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,530
那倒好了
I wish.

267
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,440
我给你点时间收回那句话
I'm going to give you a moment to take that statement back.

268
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,620
我会做我该做的  我去作证
I'll do what I have to do. I'll testify.

269
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,000
但总统完了
But the president is done.

270
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,770
他在失去支持  你能感觉到
He's losing support. You can smell it.

271
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,450
你在给别人效力吗
Are you working for anyone else?

272
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,590
-你在给别人效力吗  -没有
- Are you working for anyone else? - No.

273
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,320
我也不想知道别的
And I don't wanna know anything else.

274
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,600
我已知的已经让我烦透了
I'm tired of what I know.

275
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,260
就当我是个传话的
Consider me a proxy.

276
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,990
-什么  -他们不想问  但我来问
- What? - They don't wanna ask, but I will.

277
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,740
你必须完全投入
You need to be fully committed,

278
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,400
也就是说  你得完全透明
which means being fully transparent,

279
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,230
也就是说  你得交出你手上的东西
which means handing over what you have.

280
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,060
能拜托你等等吗
Slow down, will you, please?

281
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,190
我想回家了  戴维斯女士
I'd like to get home, Ms. Davis.

282
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,350
莉安  莉安
LeAnn? LeAnn?

283
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,870
有时候  我会去宾馆过夜
Some nights, I go to a hotel to sleep,

284
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,860
就为了换换地方  不在家待着
just to get out of my apartment.

285
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,600
这个城市的女人  都要高度警惕
Being a woman in this city, the vigilance it takes...

286
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,780
你不能犯任何错误  不能有一丝分神
You're not allowed to make a mistake... get distracted.

287
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,480
代价很沉重
It's a heavy price.

288
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,420
神经紧绷年复一年
To be on the edge that way for years and years...

289
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,810
我的证词不会让人失望的
My testimony won't disappoint.

290
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,240
就算总统和副总统满意吧
Well, the president and vice president are pleased, I assume.

291
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,870
但你觉得还要多久
But how long before the media

292
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,420
媒体就会开始追问麦卡伦的死
starts asking questions about Macallan's death,

293
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,470
以及他怎么死的
and how he was killed?

294
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
顺便说一句  你的枪在我这里
I have your gun, by the way.

295
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,010
-晚安  -没错  晚安
- Good night. - Yes, good night.

296
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,750
克莱尔
Claire?

297
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,660
-怎么了  -克莱尔
- Yes? - Claire?

298
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,060
什么事
What's the matter?

299
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
汉默施密特又有了个新理论
Hammerschmidt has a new theory.

300
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,440
他认为道格·斯坦普和我杀了佐伊·巴恩斯
He thinks Doug Stamper and I killed Zoe Barnes.

301
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,120
他们可能接触到了我的手机短信内容
They may have access to my cell phone, to my texts.

302
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,990
白宫有人在向汉默施密特泄密
Someone in this White House is talking to Hammerschmidt

303
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,420
现在又是这个
and now this.

304
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,680
道格啊
Oh, Doug.

305
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,810
可怜的道格
Poor Doug.

306
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,630
是啊
Yes.

307
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,180
他怎么这么倒霉
He's an unlucky person.

308
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,060
他一直如此
Always has been.

309
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,940
先生  参议员的支持动摇了
Sir, the senator's support is wavering.

310
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,510
道格  我是克莱尔
Doug, it's Claire.

311
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,800
抱歉  我...
I'm sorry, I...

312
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,740
弗兰西斯和我在想
Francis and I were wondering

313
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,370
你明晚能不能到宅邸来一趟
if you could come up to the residence tomorrow evening.

314
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,790
吃个晚饭
For dinner.

315
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,760
最近发生了这么多事
It'll give us a chance to

316
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,240
我们也好歇一歇  喘口气
take a breath with all that's been happening.

317
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,540
喂
Hello?

318
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,470
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

319
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,440
-你是谁  -拜托  你肯定猜到了吧
- Who is this? - Come on, you must know by now.

320
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,650
-我不知道  -艾丹·麦卡伦
- No, I don't. - Aidan Macallan.

321
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,640
查查他是怎么利用外国情报监视法裁决的
Look into how he used and abused the FISA ruling.

322
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,690
我们怎么认识的
How do we know each other?

323
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,400
别问了
Now come on.

324
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,060
如果我告诉你
If I told you that,

325
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,900
我还要怎么继续帮你
how can I possibly keep helping you?

326
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,540
你难道不希望我帮你吗
And don't you want me to help you?

327
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,200
可我们在哪见面  告诉我这个就行
But where do we meet? Just give me that.

328
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,310
-泥巴里  -等等
- In the muck. - Wait.

329
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,560
佐伊·巴恩斯的死不是意外
Zoe Barnes' death was not an accident.

330
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,300
道格·斯坦普杀了她
Doug Stamper killed her.

331
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,650
但你已经知道了
But you already know that.

332
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,060
不  别挂  别挂
No, don't hang up. Don't hang up.

333
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,150
司法委员会可能
The Judiciary Committee may be

334
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,620
还希望杜兰特国务卿尽快恢复
hoping Secretary Durant recovers.

335
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,870
但全世界都在关注
But the rest of the world is waiting to see

336
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,260
叙利亚总统将如何回应
how the Syrian president responds

337
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,320
安德伍德总统划下的红线
to President Underwood's line in the sand.

338
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,110
与此同时  莫斯科称总统此份声明
Moscow, meanwhile, calls the president's statements,

339
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,450
是"即将倒台之人的绝望之举"
"The desperate act of a man on his way out of office."

340
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,950
你和你哥哥还有联系吗
Are you in contact with your brother?

341
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,260
没有
No.

342
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,880
也就周末吧  偶尔过过生日
Sundays. Occasional birthday.

343
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,330
我还以为你们两个要更亲近些
I thought you were closer than that.

344
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,290
没有  只有有麻烦时我们才会找对方
No. We usually only speak when one of us is in trouble.

345
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,610
所以我才打听一下
Well, that's why I ask,

346
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,200
因为越是这种时候  我们就越需要支持
'cause in times like these, we all need support.

347
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
我会请律师
Well, I'll have counsel.

348
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,370
不  你得请最好的律师
No, you'll have the best lawyers.

349
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,780
什么都得最好的  顶尖的
The best of everything. The best.

350
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,100
你还想再来些鱼吗
Would you like some more fish?

351
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,060
不了  谢谢
No, thank you.

352
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,220
《先驱报》手里的料都只是间接的
Whatever the Herald has is circumstantial.

353
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,400
当然
Of course.

354
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,520
没人知道她到底遭遇了什么
No one knows what really happened to her,

355
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,840
永远也不会有人知道
and no one ever will.

356
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,880
是这样  道格
But, look, Doug...

357
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,470
今晚我和克莱尔请你来的原因
The reason that Claire and I invited you over tonight

358
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,490
是因为我们希望你知道你对我们多么重要
is because we want you to know how much you mean to us.

359
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,900
对我们两个都是
To both of us.

360
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,510
好  先生
Yes, sir.

361
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,920
在我们说别的事之前
Before we say anything else,

362
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,910
我们只想明白无误地确认
we just wanted to be absolutely certain that...

363
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,010
你知道这一点
you knew that.

364
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,390
当然
Of course.

365
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,980
我们要面临的
What we're up against,

366
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,970
这个政府要面临的
what this administration is facing...

367
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,930
也是我要面临的
Well, what I'm facing...

368
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,860
即便我们都相信
Even though both of us believe that

369
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,740
我被起诉的可能微乎其微
there's very little chance that I could ever be indicted,

370
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,210
我们仍然
we still...

371
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,960
得想办法
have to find a way to

372
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,980
彻底解决这整件事
remove this entire issue from the table.

373
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,470
我不能再跟这事有牵连了
I just can no longer be associated with this.

374
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,890
我会辞职  并继续处理此事
I'll resign while I'm dealing with this.

375
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,490
我觉得这可能还不够
I think this is going to require more than that.

376
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,420
我会发表声明
Well, I'll make a statement...

377
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,290
说这是人身攻击式的政治手段
and blame it on the politics of personal destruction.

378
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,930
不  道格  恐怕这些仍不够
No, Doug, I'm afraid that's just not going to be enough.

379
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,360
我们得转移怀疑目标
We have to shift... the suspicion.

380
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,770
我们需要你...
We need you to...

381
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,670
我们需要你让自己跟佐伊·巴恩斯的死挂上钩
We need you to implicate yourself in the death of Zoe Barnes.

382
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,940
先别激动  听我说
Now, before you react, just listen.

383
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,270
目前你是最有可能的人选
You are the most likely candidate at this point.

384
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,330
你当时心烦意乱  还酗酒
You were distraught, you were drinking.

385
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,720
我说不好
The... I don't know.

386
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,690
我们会编一些事出来  然后泄漏出去
We'll make up some story, and then we'll leak it.

387
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,660
你忠心耿耿  你那么做是为了我
You... you were loyal, you did it for me.

388
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,880
你忠诚过了头  采取了极端手段
You were too loyal. You went too far.

389
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,930
然后  到最后  毫无疑问
And... and then, in the end, there'll be no question...

390
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,520
我失陪一下好吗
Can you excuse me?

391
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,560
这要么是哪个怪胎想搏头条
Well, it's either a crank looking for a headline,

392
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,060
要么就是内部人士在说真话
or someone on the inside telling the truth.

393
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,190
你感觉是什么
What's your sense?

394
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,040
他知道生日卡的事
He knew about the birthday cards.

395
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,790
我说不好
I don't know.

396
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,810
也许重点在于这电话
Maybe the story is the call.

397
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,660
那些闪存盘  泄密本身
The flash drives. The leaks themselves.

398
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,220
如果我们点出泄密的事
If we call out the leaks,

399
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,620
他可能就不会再联系我了
he may stop contacting me.

400
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,550
还有麦卡伦的事  那真是条线索吗
And the Macallan business, is that even a real lead?

401
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,380
这些网站什么都不会承认的
None of these sites will admit to anything.

402
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,030
因为这太丢人了
Because it's an embarrassment.

403
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,380
多个选情对安德伍德不利的郡的
An overwhelming amount of Underwood material

404
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,030
社交媒体用户  爆出了大量
was reported by social media users in counties

405
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,980
安德伍德的材料
that he was expected to lose.

406
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,240
但我联系的所有人
But anyone I reach out to

407
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,090
都不想谈论此事
does not wanna be talking about this.

408
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,990
泄密者说那是未经授权的国内监控
The leak said it was unauthorized domestic surveillance.

409
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,780
政府只需要搬出"恐怖活动"
All the administration has to say is "terror,"

410
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,550
看起来就正当了
And they seem justified.

411
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,160
他可不是在铲除恐怖分子
He wasn't rooting out terrorists.

412
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,860
他是想赢得选举
He was trying to win an election.

413
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,370
国务卿正好撞了头可太巧了
And very convenient that the Secretary of State hits her head.

414
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,690
你现在听起来像是阴谋论...
Now you sound like a conspiracy...

415
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,520
我不是阴谋论者
I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

416
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,190
我试图想象他是怎么想的
I try to imagine what it's like inside his mind,

417
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,140
如果我是他  我会怎么做
what I would do if I were him.

418
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,730
我跟你们说  这是各种...
And I'm telling you, it is all sorts of...

419
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,940
他没有意识形态  没有道德方向
He has no ideology. No North Star.

420
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,520
这难道不是最可怕的吗
Isn't that the scariest thing of all?

421
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,980
汤姆  你觉得佐伊·巴恩斯是被谋杀的吗
Tom, do you think Zoe Barnes was murdered?

422
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,110
一个27岁的人失足撞上火车的概率有多大
How often does a 27-year-old fall in front of a train?

423
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,320
-那好吧  我们去证明它  -好
- All right, then. Let's prove that. - All right.

424
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,630
怎么了
What's wrong?

425
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,660
道格·斯坦普的办公室来电了
Doug Stamper's office called.

426
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,220
他们想安排见面
They wanna set up a meeting.

427
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,500
尽快吧
Soon as possible.

428
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,510
这是好事
This is good.

429
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,210
不管你男友今早从你手机里读到了什么
Whatever your boyfriend read off your phone this morning

430
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,520
都传到了正确的人的耳朵里
made its way to the right person.

431
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,490
我不知道我还能坚持多久
I don't know how much longer I can do this.

432
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,960
你只是在骗一个骗子
You're lying to a liar.

433
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,130
你无法从佐伊死时的手机上得到任何信息
You can't get anything off the phone Zoe died with.

434
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,390
他们只要相信我们能做到就行了
They just need to believe we can.

435
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,760
这到底是什么工作
What is this job?

436
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,550
跟以前不一样了
Not what it used to be.

437
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,920
我不希望你反应过度
I don't want you to overreact.

438
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,200
但汤姆一直在继续写作
But Tom kept writing.

439
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,880
看来他终于完成他的书了
It seems he finally finished his book.

440
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,940
而且他暗示了一些事
And he alludes to things.

441
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,470
什么叫"暗示了一些事"
What do you mean "Alludes to things"?

442
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,710
我不知道  相关行都被涂黑了
I don't know. Lines are blacked out.

443
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,630
就像被编辑过
It's like it's redacted.

444
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,600
时不时的有一些段落
There are paragraphs here and there...

445
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,030
你跟他说过什么
What did you tell him?

446
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,040
他知道些什么
What does he know?

447
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,290
他给任何人看过吗  寄给过任何人吗
Has he shown this to anyone? Sent it to anyone?

448
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,080
-出版商  媒体  -我不知道
- Publishers, the press? - I don't know.

449
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,640
那你知道什么
Well, what do you know?

450
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,750
我来处理他  我只是想跟你说一声
I will handle him. I just wanted you to be aware.

451
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,150
-妈了个逼的  -我说了我会处理的
- Son of a bitch. - I said I'll take care of it.

452
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,300
不  我来处理
No, I'll take care of it.

453
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,640
你躲得远远的
You stay a million miles away from this.

454
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,020
你怎么会这么蠢
How could you be so stupid...

455
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,270
动了真情
to fall in love?

456
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,490
这事还没提交表决
This thing isn't on the floor yet,

457
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,510
我们就已经失去参议员的支持了
and we're losing senators.

458
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,140
失去了几个吧  不过
We're losing some maybe, but...

459
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,920
参院最讨喜的地方也是我最讨厌的地方
What I like about the Senate is what I hate.

460
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,610
传染性
It's contagious.

461
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,590
只要一个人有了什么想法
One of 'em gets an idea,

462
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,820
立马就会像流感一样传遍全院
and it spreads through the body like a flu.

463
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,080
我再想想办法
I'll look into it.

464
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,080
总共就100个人  我们只需要过半
There's 100 of 'em. All we need is half.

465
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,660
我能躺下吗
Can I just lay down?

466
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,860
-最好不要  -我就躺几分钟
- I don't think that's a good idea. - Just for a few minutes.

467
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,410
我他妈快累死了  我得想想
I'm just so fucking tired, and I need to think.

468
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,910
你得想什么
Why do you need to think?

469
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,330
他给你的那些东西  你拿在手里越久
The longer you hang on to whatever he gave you,

470
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,970
你的处境就越危险
the more danger you're in.

471
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,650
你错看局势了
You're reading this wrong.

472
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,830
你以为那是保险  其实不是
You think it's some kind of insurance, but it's not.

473
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,580
莉安
LeAnn...

474
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,840
不管总统出了什么事
Whatever happens to the president,

475
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,630
都不是你  或者我的错
it's not your fault, or mine.

476
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,080
-你以为我无关紧要吗  -我可没这么说
- You don't think I make a difference? - I didn't say that.

477
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,230
还是你觉得我不够投入
You don't think that I'm dedicated enough?

478
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,610
太投入了
Too dedicated.

479
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,720
过了就有问题了  会让你一叶障目
That can be a problem. That can make you blind.

480
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,510
你根本不知道
You have no idea...

481
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,090
我做了不可原谅的事  莉安
I've done something unforgivable, LeAnn.

482
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,810
什么
What?

483
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,390
我杀了佐伊·巴恩斯
I killed Zoe Barnes.

484
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,910
你为什么要这么说
Why would you say that?

485
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,600
我只是想保护她
All I ever tried to do was keep her safe.

486
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,890
她说她想就此消失
She said she wanted to be invisible.

487
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,370
我知道这根本不可能
I knew it wasn't possible.

488
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,560
我知道她要消失
I knew that she would only ever go away...

489
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,930
就得我亲自动手
if I made sure of it.

490
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,080
我不信你
I don't believe you.

491
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,150
你当然信
Yes, you do.

492
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,350
相信我  这是我活该
Believe me... I deserve this.

493
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,650
佐伊·巴恩斯落轨被地铁撞死了
Zoe Barnes fell in front of a train.

494
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,980
调查结果是意外事故
It was ruled an accident.

495
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,200
是我把她从站台上推下去的  然后我就走了
I pushed her off the platform and I walked away.

496
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,930
我知道你联系了布莉姬特·柯恩
I know you reached out to Bridget Cohen.

497
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,180
把我肝脏的来头告诉她或是委员会
Telling that committee or her how I got my liver

498
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,650
对政府  对你  都没有一丝好处
is not going to help this administration or you.

499
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,300
我告诉你做什么有好处
But here is what is going to help.

500
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,390
我要你去找委员会
This is what you're going to tell that committee

501
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,700
这么说道格·斯坦普
about Doug Stamper.

502
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,960
你就住这儿
You actually live here?

503
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,880
我不经常住
Well... I'm not here that much.

504
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,970
偶尔让我朋友来住住
I let friends use it now and again.

505
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,520
-谢谢你的谨慎  -应该的
- Thanks for your discretion. - Of course.

506
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,330
我不会待太久
I won't be too long.

507
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,100
你慢慢来
Take your time.

508
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,230
如果需要什么  我随叫随到
If you need anything, I'll be on call.

509
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,060
他是讲道理的
He's reasonable.

510
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,540
是啊  他必须这样
Yeah, he needs to be.

511
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,780
他们也没怎么查
They didn't look that hard.

512
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,120
特勤局知道我没什么好隐瞒的
The Secret Service knows I have nothing to hide.

513
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,800
他就在楼下
He's downstairs.

514
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,770
别客气
Make yourself at home.

515
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,100
我小时候可喜欢捉迷藏了
I used to love to hide as a kid.

516
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,840
我总是藏得非常好
I was really good at it.

517
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,690
我总能找到最隐蔽的藏身处
I could always choose the best places.

518
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,290
从来没被抓到过
Nobody ever found me.

519
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,340
有一次大家干脆不玩了
One time, everybody just gave up.

520
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,130
所以我在那儿躲了整整13个小时
So I stayed put for, like, 13 hours straight.

521
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,720
你想要什么
What do you want?

522
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,770
他说如果我同意  我绝不会后悔的
He said I wouldn't regret it... if I said yes.

523
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,880
弗兰西斯
Francis.

524
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,510
就是想当初  我同意
When I agreed to write the book

525
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,070
写他起家的故事的时候
about his origin story way back when.

526
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,260
那他现在可后悔请你了
Well, he regrets asking you now.

527
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,010
我同意  是因为我总是非常喜欢
I said yes 'cause I have always been a sucker

528
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,560
听别人是怎么讲他们自己的
for what people tell themselves about themselves.

529
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,400
谁还有手稿
Who has the manuscript?

530
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,830
只有你
You do.

531
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,840
出版商呢
And publishers?

532
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,030
还没给
Not yet.

533
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,840
所以你觉得如何
So what did you think?

534
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,330
有好多段落你都划掉了  汤姆
There are huge sections blacked out, Tom.

535
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,000
你把我们描绘成了怪物
You portrayed us like a couple of monsters.

536
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,890
-我没这么写  -你也不用写出来
- I never used that word. - You didn't have to.

537
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,640
我们刚认识时  在从莫斯科回来的飞机上
On the flight back from Moscow, not long after we met...

538
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,610
你和弗兰西斯大吵了一架
you and Francis had a fight.

539
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,540
吵得很凶
A real knock down.

540
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,510
我告诉弗兰西斯我听见了吼声
I told Francis I heard the yelling,

541
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,720
但没听清说什么
but not the words.

542
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,590
但
But...

543
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,920
你说你们杀了人
you said you were murderers.

544
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,310
他说你们是适者生存
He said you were survivors.

545
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,500
我害怕到这里来
I was dreading coming here.

546
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,290
-为什么  -你不能出版  汤姆
- Why? - You can't publish it, Tom.

547
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,580
我也不想
I'd rather not.

548
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,850
那为什么  钱吗
So, what? Money?

549
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,110
对  但是够了
Yeah... but enough.

550
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,060
足够让我消失一阵了
Enough so I can really get lost for a while.

551
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,010
静一静  让我好好想想该何去何从
Buy some time till I figure out what I'm gonna do next.

552
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,490
我们可以商量个对策的
We can figure something out.

553
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,930
当然
I bet.

554
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,610
那些你涂黑的部分
You know, those parts you blacked out, that's...

555
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,630
-除了你我谁都没告诉过  -我知道
- I've never told anyone but you. - I know.

556
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,540
我什么都知道
I know everything.

557
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,440
但你要的不就是这样吗
But isn't that what you wanted?

558
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,780
我想念抚摸你
I miss touching you.

559
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,380
我不知道没有你在身边该如何是好
I don't know how to not be around you.

560
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,200
我无时无刻不想着你
I think of you all the time.

561
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,890
都快要因此而恨你了
It almost makes me hate you for it.

562
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

563
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,280
你太美了
You're so beautiful.

564
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,910
-继续说  -不仅是一般的美
- Keep going. - Not just beautiful, beautiful.

565
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,530
美人千千万万
There's lots of people like that.

566
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,610
你美得目眩  克莱尔
You are radiant, Claire.

567
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,460
而且善良  你太善良了
And good. You are so good.

568
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,800
-我不善良  -不  你是善良的
- I'm not good. - Yes, you are.

569
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,280
-你为什么不吻我  -我想看着你
- Why won't you kiss me? - I wanna look at you.

570
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,930
我真想有一天能去格陵兰
I really do wanna go to Greenland one day.

571
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,250
-我们应该去  -别停
- We should go. - Don't stop.

572
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,660
冰天雪地  如此遥远
It's so frozen and remote.

573
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,700
那里的
The way the...

574
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,210
那里的  气味
The way the... Smells before it...

575
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,690
你知道我什么意思吧
The... You know what I mean?

576
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,870
救命  救命
Help. Help.

577
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,520
汤姆
Tom?

578
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,900
死亡人数将近五十万
There are close to half a million dead.

579
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,430
有超过四百万名难民

580
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,370
背井离乡  需要照料的妇女儿童
women and children who have left the region and require care.

581
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,950
流离失所的人至少有一千两百万
At least 12 million displaced people.

582
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,280
无处可去  无家可归的流浪者
Homeless wanderers who no longer belong anywhere.

583
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,470
我们都学过历史
We are all students of history.

584
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,040
叙利亚可是联合国创始国之一
Syria was one of the founding members of the United Nations,

585
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,260
天呐
for God's sakes.

586
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,270
我们是怎么走到今天的
How did we get here?

587
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,350
我们来自最古老的文明之一
We, who sprang from one of the most ancient civilizations?

588
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,910
我们终得承认  和平才是唯一的答案
At some point, we must accept peace as the only answer.

589
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:17,310
各方必须放下武器  开始和谈
All parties must lay down their arms and begin to talk.

590
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,990
好吧
Okay.

591
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,790
你总能找到我
You were always good at tracking me down.

592
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,100
很不容易
It wasn't easy.

593
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,870
电影院  偶尔的秘密会议
Movie theater, the occasional classified meeting.

594
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,320
我知道你在干什么
I know what you're doing.

595
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,310
这么说有点含糊
Well, that's a bit vague.

596
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,190
你是在给他捣乱  让参议员倒戈
You're sabotaging him. Peeling off senators.

597
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,270
我知道是你干的
I know it's you.

598
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,860
你抽烟的时候要有趣得多
You were much more interesting when you smoked.

599
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,020
我没有
No, I wasn't.

600
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,920
钱不在他那儿  马克
The money's not with him, Mark.

601
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,240
科赫兄弟那些人  华尔街  石油天然气
The... the Koch brother types, Wall Street, oil and gas...

602
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,740
连工人都要抛弃他了
Even labor's walking out on him.

603
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,250
他比你想得要神通广大
He's more resourceful than you think.

604
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,680
没有钱他也做了很多  好吧
He's done a lot without money, okay?

605
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,150
我要你别插手
I want you to back off,

606
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,880
让我应付听证会
let me handle these hearings.

607
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,100
我刚到白宫
I just got to the White House.

608
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,150
我想留下
I intend to stick around.

609
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,220
我不希望他当总统
I don't want him to be president.

610
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,840
-国家需要改变  -好  那么
- The country needs a change. - Okay, so...

611
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,210
有他妻子  就不用找其他人选了
And they don't need to look any further than his wife.

612
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,890
她坚韧又聪明
She's tough, smart.

613
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,660
他也很聪明  但他不可靠
He's smart, too, but he's not reliable.

614
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,870
至于她  你可以跟她合作
Her? You can work with her.

615
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,540
我知道你也清楚这一点
I know you see it, too.

616
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,530
叙利亚  或者满目疮痍的叙利亚
I see a partner when it comes to Syria,

617
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,970
可以成为合作伙伴
or what's left of it.

618
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,600
给我一个
Let me try one of those.

619
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,800
我们就不该
I mean, far be it from us

620
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,490
告诉一个古老的文明怎么处理它的问题
to tell an ancient civilization its business...

621
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,930
但现在  叙利亚是这世界上
but Syria is now basically unrivaled

622
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,640
-最暴力的地方  -我知道
- as the most violent place on the planet. - I know, I know.

623
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,300
我不是说  要拿弗兰克·安德伍德怎么办
I'm not saying what to do with Frank Underwood

624
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,580
不会成为一个巨大的麻烦
is not gonna be a difficult problem.

625
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,360
但  如果我们不在当地立足
But... if we don't establish a presence in the region...

626
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,580
那就太迟了
it's gonna be too late.

627
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,000
-我更想抽根烟  -吐出来吧
- I'd rather have a cigarette. - Spit it out.

628
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,100
让我请你吃晚饭吧
Well... let me buy you dinner or something.

629
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,770
怎么  怎么了
What? What happened? What's the matter?

630
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,830
我抱着那孩子
I had that child in my arms.

631
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,370
我能感觉到她的呼吸
I could feel her breath on me,

632
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,070
但却不敢往下看
but I couldn't look down.

633
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,250
失陪
Excuse me.

634
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,190
喂
Yeah?

635
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,970
20分钟就到
20 minutes away.

636
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,110
-好  我得走了  抱歉  -去吧
- Okay. I have to go. I'm sorry. - Do, please.

637
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,430
我累了  我去睡了
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

638
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,790
我需要你的服务
I need your services.

639
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,560
天呐
Jesus.

640
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,410
不
No.

641
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,030
马上
Now.

642
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,090
我认为道格·斯坦普杀了佐伊·巴恩斯
I believe Doug Stamper killed Zoe Barnes.

643
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,140
我认为他情绪不稳定
I believe he was unstable

644
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,870
为了弗兰西斯·安德伍德杀了她
and killed her to benefit Francis Underwood.

645
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,530
暂停  不要记录
Stop. Stop it, please? Off the record.

646
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,160
能让我们单独待会儿吗  我再叫你
Can you give us a second? I'll call you back in.

647
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,920
赛斯  这跟贿赂或卡拉比毫无关系
Seth, this has nothing to do with pay for play, or Kalabi,

648
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,400
跟其他任何总统受到的指控都无关
or anything else the president is accused of.

649
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,340
你想干什么
Where are you getting this?

650
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,500
这是我知道的道格的事
This is what I know about Doug.

651
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,000
主席不会允许
The chair will not let you

652
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,570
你在委员会前就此作证的
testify in front of the committee with this.

653
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,630
-我只有这些  -你能证明吗
- This is what I have. - Can you prove any of it?

654
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,380
他暗示他那么做了
He's implied that he did it.

655
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,630
我可以阐述他的行为
I can speak to his behavior.

656
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,140
他做的事
Things that he's done.

657
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,400
你得去找联邦检察官
You need to go to the US attorney.

658
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,060
赛斯  否则  我会去的
Seth, if you don't, I will.

659
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,640
"我告诉总统  国务院追踪了四个
"I told the president there were four men by the same name

660
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,400
同名的男子
the State Department was tracking.

661
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,010
两个在美国境内"
Two in the United States."

662
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,530
这引述自一位资深白宫人士
So said a senior White House source,

663
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,590
由《华盛顿先驱报》刊登的
as quoted in the Washington Herald.

664
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,910
你是否知道这对话
Were you aware of this conversation?

665
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,350
不  先生  不知道
No, sir, I was not.

666
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,090
消息源还称
The source went on.

667
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,900
"我认为总统知道
"I believe the president understood

668
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,940
田纳西州的默罕默德·卡拉比
that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee

669
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,900
并非真正的威胁"
was not a legitimate threat."

670
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,050
这你是否知道
Was this conveyed to you in any way?

671
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,230
还是不知道  先生
Again, no, sir.

672
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,800
委员会依然期待
Still, the committee's looking forward to

673
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,940
杜兰特国务卿就此事作证
Secretary Durant's testimony on this matter.

674
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,390
我不知道国务卿会说什么  但是
I have no idea what the secretary will say or not say, but I...

675
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,500
我对她很尊敬  也祝愿她早日康复
have great respect for her and wish her a speedy recovery.

676
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,850
我们那天是依据
We were operating off of facts and

677
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,110
飞速涌入的事实和报告行动的
reports coming in at an accelerated rate that day.

678
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,870
我再问一次
I'll try this again.

679
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,280
总统是否曾向你暗示
Did the president indicate to you at any time

680
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,190
他知道这并非真正威胁
that he knew this was not a threat?

681
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,290
没有
No.

682
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,240
而且我要说  我很骄傲
And I'd like to point out that I'm proud

683
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,340
今天能在此代表联调局的男男女女
to be representing the men and women of the FBI here today,

684
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,060
他们像以往一样进行了此案的调查
who conducted that investigation as they always do

685
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,760
得力  诚实  而且独立
in a competent, honest, and independent way,

686
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,150
这是联调局的优良传统
in the finest tradition of the FBI.

687
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,620
-是吗  -我们的人尽了职
- Did they? - Our people did their job.

688
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,070
认为联调局会
And it's unthinkable to assume

689
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,880
卷入选举根本是无稽之谈
the FBI would involve itself in an election.

690
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,240
因为此时此刻可能有一个
Because there may be an innocent man

691
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,960
无辜的人正在蹲监狱
sitting in a cell as we speak.

692
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,190
我可以就此发表评论  因为报道中有提及
I can comment on this since it was mentioned in the press.

693
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,670
卡拉比先生的电脑上
Trace amounts of an explosive material

694
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,450
的确发现了痕量爆炸物
were found on Mr. Kalabi's computer.

695
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,380
你是说  总统不知道
Your assertion is that the president was unaware

696
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,570
自己的白宫里都发生了什么
of what was happening in his own White House?

697
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,770
艾丹·麦卡伦是国安局的雇员
Aidan Macallan was an NSA employee,

698
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,520
所以  不  总统不知道他都做了什么
so, no, the president had no idea what he was up to.

699
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,210
老实说  他当时在忙于竞选
Honestly, he was quite busy campaigning.

700
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,730
但他肯定知道麦卡伦先生做的事的影响吧
But surely he knew the effects of Mr. Macallan's work?

701
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,690
这些漏洞
These exploits?

702
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,720
不知道
No.

703
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,450
总统  我是跟着他去巡回过的
The president and... I've been with him out on the stump.

704
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,840
他喜欢跟人握手
He likes to shake hands.

705
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,730
他并不关注社交媒体
He's not paying attention to social media.

706
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,690
哈维小姐  外国情报监视法法庭发布了一则判决
Ms. Harvey, there was a FISA ruling issued,

707
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,440
而安德伍德政府利用它
which the Underwood administration used

708
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,980
来监视美国公民
to spy on American citizens

709
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,720
意在影响选举
for the sake of swaying an election.

710
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,620
罗梅洛议员  艾丹·麦卡伦是个有困扰的人
Congressman Romero, Aidan Macallan was a troubled person.

711
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,290
他的脑子转得很快
His mind worked fast,

712
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,420
恐怕已超出了正常范围
faster than I think anyone's should.

713
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,850
他的企图已被他带入坟墓
What he was up to went to the grave with him.

714
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,620
哈维小姐  少跟我打感情牌
Ms. Harvey, please, spare me the semantics...

715
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,140
-好吧  -我只需要你
- Okay, fine. - I just need you...

716
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,520
他收集数据了吗  是的
Was he collecting data? Yes.

717
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,760
他过界了吗  很可能
Did he cross a line? Most likely.

718
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,040
我去看过他  看他的工作
I did visit with him, checking in on his work.

719
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,350
你见过一屏的代码吗  电脑代码
Have you seen a screen of code? Computer code.

720
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,090
那根本看不懂
It's indecipherable.

721
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,130
赛斯·格雷森怎么最终没作证
Why did Seth Grayson end up not testifying?

722
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,030
无可评价
No comment.

723
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,290
我们听说他的证词
We heard that his testimony

724
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,340
跟总统的幕僚长有关
had to do with the president's chief of staff.

725
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,230
我很欢迎他来我们委员会作证
Who I would welcome testifying in front of our committee.

726
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,340
我敦促道格·斯坦普和其他政府人员
I urge Doug Stamper and the rest of the administration

727
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,920
别再躲在行政特权之后了
to stop hiding behind executive privilege.

728
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,560
我们目前只知道
All we learned so far is that

729
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,860
总统对他的白宫发生的事毫不知情
the president knew nothing about anything going on in his White House.

730
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,380
一共六个人
There were six of them,

731
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,100
他们轮流来
and they all took a turn.

732
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,140
除了罗梅洛
Except for Romero.

733
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,970
他只是看了
He only watched.

734
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,610
至少他是这么跟校长说的
Or... at least that's what he told the dean.

735
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,400
但我知道真相
But I know the real story.

736
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,400
她叫罗谢尔
Her name was, uh, Rochelle.

737
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,600
你不是没有他的把柄吗
I thought you had nothing on this guy.

738
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,690
你知道多久了
How long have you known this?

739
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,800
我是想留到我们需要的时候
I was holding it until... Or, if we needed it.

740
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,720
是你需要的时候吧
No, until you needed it, you mean.

741
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,050
这没什么区别
Look, it makes no difference.

742
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,350
我可能会用  可能不会
I might use it, I might not.

743
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,730
但我还是想作证
But I still wanna testify.

744
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:22,560
你现在作证
For you to testify now,

745
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,360
抱歉  简直疯了
excuse me for saying it, it's crazy.

746
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,140
你觉得疯了吗  克莱尔
Do you think it's crazy, Claire?

747
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,020
-我想在他面前维护自己  -我们有证人
- I wanna defend myself against this guy. - We have witnesses.

748
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,370
我们的证人  代理人  让他们说
Our witnesses, surrogates. Let it come from them.

749
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,660
我觉得我能赢
I think I can win.

750
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,210
或者我该等到我被参议院抛弃
Or maybe I should wait until I lose the Senate...

751
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,410
我就是觉得还有别的办法
I just think there are other ways...

752
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,030
如果你放弃行政特权
If you give up executive privilege,

753
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,050
我们就丧失了筹码  完全没了
we lose leverage. We lose it all.

754
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,080
告诉主席  我愿作证了
Tell the chair I'm ready to appear.

755
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,470
你的证词可能对你妻子造成的伤害
I mean, the damage your testimony could do to your wife

756
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,170
不值得冒险
is not worth the risk.

757
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,690
我们就是要讨论它的价值
Its worth is what we're here to discuss.

758
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,100
我不喜欢由我来说  但是
I... I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but...

759
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,270
你的总统之位已经保不住了
your presidency is beyond repair.

760
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,210
你不知道我接下来要做什么
You don't know what I'm going to do next.

761
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,340
不是这个吗  这才是让你困扰的吧
Isn't that it? Isn't that what really bothers you?

762
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,760
别以为我没从你加入的那一刻
Don't think I haven't been watching you

763
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,930
就在观察你
from the moment you stepped on board.

764
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,550
你满口承诺  戴维斯女士
You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.

765
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,050
麦卡伦的事仍未平息
The information about Macallan is still out there

766
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,480
而艾哈迈迪则神出鬼没
and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.

767
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,640
你从走进我家
You've been sabotaging me

768
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,610
就一直在给我捣乱
from the moment you stepped into my house.

769
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,880
你不喜欢我  是吧
You don't care for me very much, do you?

770
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,410
是的
No, I don't.

771
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,110
我一点也不喜欢
I couldn't care less.

772
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,540
但如果你让克莱尔开心  我就开心
But if you make Claire happy, that makes me happy.

773
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,130
如果你能好好帮她
If you can help her,

774
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,400
-那很好  -你愿付出什么
- good. - What's it worth to you?

775
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,460
你打算做什么样的交易
Well, what kind of deal are we talking about?

776
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,000
要我不作证
For me not to testify.

777
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,830
我在华府外有人
Well, I have contacts outside the Beltway.

778
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,590
我可以给你找到各种肥差
I can set you up in any number of lucrative positions.

779
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,560
不  那不够好
No, that's not good enough.

780
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,300
谁都能给我那个
Anyone could offer me that.

781
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,250
你说呢
You tell me.

782
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,720
不不  不能这样
No, no, no. It's not going to work like that.

783
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,860
你说你能为我做什么
You tell me what you can do for me.

784
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,500
我接触过你这样的人
I've been around your kind.

785
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,660
一般没接触到这种深度
Not usually at this level.

786
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,660
但你就是忍不住
But you can't help yourself.

787
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,390
给我开价  戴维斯女士
Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.

788
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,440
你愿为她付出什么
What is she worth to you?

789
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,360
很多
A lot.

790
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,540
那么我是这么想的
So then here's what I'm thinking.

791
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,410
你是否庄严宣誓确认
Do you solemnly swear and affirm

792
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,150
你即将给出的证词是真相
that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,

793
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,950
全部真相  绝无隐瞒
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

794
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,090
我宣誓
I do.

795
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,470
请记录
Let the record reflect that

796
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,230
证人给出了肯定回答
the witness has answered in the affirmative.

797
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,820
总统先生  我想感谢你前来作证
Mr. President, I want to thank you for appearing...

798
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,500
希望我们可以为美国人民
and I hope we get to clear some things up

799
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,750
澄清一些事
for the American people.

800
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,740
总统先生  你可以开始
Mr. President, the floor is yours.

801
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,830
你想讲多久都行
You can take as long or as short as you like.

802
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,820
如果你有书面声明
If you have any written statement,

803
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,140
我们会在稍后将它纳入记录
we will include it after and it will be part of the record.

804
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,350
总统先生  请讲
Mr. President, you are recognized.

805
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,120
谢谢  主席先生
Thank you, Mr. Chairman...

806
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,400
也感谢其他委员会成员
and to the other members of this committee.

807
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,700
我今天同意在委员会面前作证
I have agreed to appear before this committee today...

808
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,500
是因为
because...

809
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,940
我有罪
I'm guilty.

810
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,570
我花了30年的人生
Guilty of having spent the last 30 years of my life

811
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,700
在这里
here...

812
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,660
在国会
in this Congress.

813
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,580
在众议院
In this House.

814
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,950
然后成为副总统  总统
Then as vice president and now as president,

815
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,070
只为效力于人民
trying to do the people's work.

816
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:39,180
委员会指控我犯下了很多事
Now, this committee has accused me of a great number of things.

817
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,150
你们指控我贿赂
You accused me of pay to play.

818
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,880
那么我也指控你们犯下了同样罪行
And so I accuse you of exactly the same.

819
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,670
我还指控你们只为自己的利益行使政治手段
I also accuse you of playing politics only when it suits you.

820
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,960
你们都拿了钱
You're all being paid.

821
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,740
你们都有要效力的主子
You're all serving some master.

822
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,680
你们每个人
Each and every one of you,

823
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,980
你们知道我所言不虚
and you know I know that for a fact.

824
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,320
比如你  罗梅洛议员
You, for example, Congressman Romero...

825
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:12,010
你扳倒我的不懈努力  是为了正义吗
and your crusade to take me down, is it for justice?

826
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,190
为了国家吗
For the good of the nation?

827
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,200
你真的是想要真相吗
Is the truth what you're really after?

828
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,030
还是为了个人利益
Or is it for some personal gain?

829
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,410
或许是为了填补
Perhaps to try to fill

830
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,380
你很久之前卖掉的
the small hole in your soul

831
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,730
那一块灵魂留下的空洞
that you sold off a long time ago?

832
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,200
-总统先生  -不  不  不
- Mr. President. - No, no, no.

833
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,460
这是我的开场陈述
This is my opening statement,

834
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,500
我要说完
and I will give it in full.

835
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,660
我还没说完  女士们先生们
I am not done, ladies and gentlemen.

836
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,310
你们指控我违反规则
You accuse me of breaking the rules,

837
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,580
我告诉你们  我完全遵守规则
and I tell you, I am playing by the rules.

838
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,470
正是你们和我一起达成的规则
The very rules that you and I all agreed upon.

839
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,550
正是你们和我
The very rules that you and I

840
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,680
一起写的规则
all wrote together.

841
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,460
是的  我非常有罪
So, yes, I'm guilty as hell,

842
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,340
但你们也都有罪
but then so are all of you.

843
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,520
是的  体制有问题
Yes, the system is corrupt,

844
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,630
但你们想要我这样的人守门
but you wanted a guardian at the gate like me.

845
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,570
为什么呢
And why?

846
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,000
因为你们知道
Because you know

847
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,780
我会不惜一切
I will do whatever it takes.

848
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,750
你们都喜欢这样
And you have all enjoyed it,

849
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,190
参与其中  并从中获利
been party to it and benefited by it.

850
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,690
别否认  你喜欢的
Don't deny it. You've loved it.

851
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,190
你并不需要我坚持什么
You don't actually need me to stand for anything.

852
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,220
你只希望我站出来
You just need me to stand.

853
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,390
希望我强势
To be the strong man.

854
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,290
希望我采取行动
The man of action.

855
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:39,980
天呐  你好喜欢行动和口号
My God, you're addicted to action and slogans.

856
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,840
不管我说了什么
It doesn't matter what I say.

857
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,150
我做了什么
It doesn't matter what I do.

858
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,430
只要我有所作为
Just as long as I'm doing something,

859
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,920
你就乐意跟着走
you're happy to be along for the ride.

860
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,800
老实说  我不怪你
And frankly, I don't blame you.

861
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,430
你生活中有那么多愚蠢和犹豫
With all the foolishness and indecision in your lives,

862
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,520
为什么不要个我这样的人
why not a man like me?

863
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,430
我不道歉
I don't apologize.

864
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,310
最终  我不在意你是爱我还是恨我
In the end, I don't care whether you love me or you hate me,

865
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,470
只要我赢就行
just as long as I win.

866
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,410
结局早被安排好  规则是被操纵的
The deck is stacked. The rules are rigged.

867
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,880
欢迎来到理智时代的终结
Welcome to the death of the Age of Reason.

868
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,490
已经没有是非了
There is no right or wrong. Not anymore.

869
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,010
只有入局
There's only being in...

870
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,560
和出局
and then being out.

871
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,050
所以我不要再参与其中了
So I will not be party to this any longer.

872
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,480
我不要再替你们背负骂名了
I will not wear the target for any of you anymore.

873
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,670
你们都已经利用我太久了
You have all used me far long enough.

874
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,440
所以派对结束  旅程结束
So, the party's over, the ride's done.

875
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,020
我太尊重这一职位
I respect the office too much

876
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,140
不能允许这继续下去
to allow this to continue going on.

877
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,470
所以我要向委员会和全国人民宣布
That's why I am announcing to this committee and to the nation

878
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,780
明晚6点起
that as of 6:00 p.m. tomorrow evening,

879
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,960
我将辞去美国总统一职
I shall resign the office of President of the United States.

880
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,290
秩序
Order!

881
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:05,030
届时我乐意回答你们的一切问题
And I will be happy to take any questions you may have.

882
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:09,040
但我的直觉是  已经没那个必要了
But my gut tells me that isn't really going to be necessary.

884
00:52:09,250 --> 00:53:09,250
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}听证会作证有两个类型
一种要求证人宣誓  宣誓后如果说谎  就是违法行为
另一种不宣誓  有不实之言不用负法律责任
如果被发现宣誓后说谎  可能被国会表决定为"蔑视国会"
但位高权重之人  往往也只受到书面谴责  并不一定真的会被起诉
普通人则不敢冒险
国会有发传票的权力  收到传票的人按法律规定需要服从
但如果不服从  并不会直接受到惩罚
往往是  如果在接受调查时不配合  那么可能会导致司法介入
然后走法律程序  被起诉定罪
同样  如果国会在调查后发现被调查者有违法行为
那么相关的司法部门会随即介入  进行进一步的起诉  定罪
也就是说  国会调查很严重  但并不能代替法律程序
