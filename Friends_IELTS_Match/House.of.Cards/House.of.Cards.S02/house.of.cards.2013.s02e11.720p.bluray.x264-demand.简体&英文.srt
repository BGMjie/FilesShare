副总统刚刚走进司法部大楼
The Vice President just entered the Department of Justice.

14
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,620
现场请到的是艾拉·萨伊德
We're here with Ayla Sayyad,

15
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,990
她发表在《华尔街电讯报》上的文章
whose Wall Street Telegraph article

16
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,650
直接促成了这次调查  艾拉
catalyzed the investigation. Ayla.

17
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,870
关键问题在于白宫与此事是否有牵连
The issue at stake is whether the White House was in any way involved.

18
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,100
是否有国外资金用于换取政治支持
Was foreign money traded for political favors?

19
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,180
又是否对外交关系产生影响
Did it influence diplomatic relations?

20
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,330
单是为来自中国的政治献金洗白就是违法的
Just the act of laundering Chinese contributions is illegal.

21
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,680
如果这笔钱对白宫决策产生影响的话
If it had a significant impact on White House policy,

22
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,410
那就是更严重的罪行了
that's a far more serious crime.

23
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,040
你曾多次与丹尼尔·拉尼根会面
You've met with Daniel Lanagin on multiple occasions.

24
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,920
没错  2003年起我们曾11次共处一室
We were in the same room, yes, on 11 occasions since 2003.

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,440
但其中我们交谈过的只有三次
But we only spoke on three of those occasions.

26
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,950
那几次已经标出来了
Those instances are highlighted.

27
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,610
你们谈了什么
What did you discuss?

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,550
那都是在筹款会上
Well, these were fundraisers.

29
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,080
我对着几十号人发表讲话
I speak to dozens of people,

30
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,800
也没有什么特定的话题
usually about nothing at all.

31
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,230
我是南方人  邓巴女士
I'm southern, Ms. Dunbar.

32
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,250
我妈妈教导我
My mother taught me that

33
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,870
席间讲话不仅礼貌
conversation during mealtime is not only polite,

34
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,000
还有助消化
it aids the digestive process.

35
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,230
那你没有跟他谈到过
So you didn't speak to him

36
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,280
阿道希部落向这些超级政治行动委员会捐款的事吗
about the Adohi tribe's contributions to any of these super PACs?

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,250
绝对没有
Absolutely not.

38
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,890
我从不和支持者提超级政治行动委员会
I never discuss super PACs with any supporters.

39
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,270
我们熟悉法律规定
We both know the law.

40
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,590
在这些礼节性的谈话中
During one of these polite conversations,

41
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,290
拉尼根先生可曾向你提起过冯山德
do you recall Mr. Lanagin ever mentioning Xander Feng?

42
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,640
我想没有
I do not.

43
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,110
你听说过这个名字吗
Does that name mean anything to you?

44
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,210
你是说除了铺天盖地的媒体报道吗
Other than being plastered all over the news?

45
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,830
从这个角度说  就像我也听说过金·卡戴珊
In that regard it means as much as Kim Kardashian.

46
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,080
那我再说得明确些
Then let me be more specific.

47
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,690
你对冯先生的政治活动有什么了解
What knowledge do you have of Mr. Feng's political activities?

48
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,670
这是你丈夫的意思还是
Is this coming from your husband, or is it...?

49
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,770
是我的意思
From me.

50
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,000
而且不是说我不再支持法案了
And it's not that I don't support the bill anymore.

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,730
只是采访的事
It's just the article.

52
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,560
我们已经答应让马特做专访了
We've promised Matt an interview.

53
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,140
那往后推几周吧
Maybe in a few weeks,

54
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,430
等调查尘埃落定之后再说
once the investigation has died down.

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,710
《纽约时代杂志》可不会干等着我们
The New York Times isn't going to wait for us.

56
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,630
他们已经腾出十月份的封面
They've already scheduled the cover for October.

57
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,320
鉴于我们的安排
Based on our timing --

58
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,380
那就恕难参与了
Then I can't be a part of it.

59
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,460
是因为嘉乐威的事  是不是
It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?

60
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,550
克莱尔  别这么说
Claire, come on.

61
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,680
没事的
It's okay.

62
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,420
你直说就行  我们是朋友
You can say so. We're friends.

63
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,350
的确影响不好
It doesn't help.

64
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,310
你不会真相信我
You don't actually believe I --

65
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,600
当然不信
No.

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,400
但国内还是有不少人信的
But enough of the country still does.

67
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,330
加勒特现在需要争取每一份支持
And Garrett needs every bit of support he can get right now.

68
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,080
那你心意已决了
So there's no convincing you?

69
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,350
我会尽可能帮你
I'll help as much as I can.

70
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,700
悄悄地帮
Quietly.

71
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,770
有传言说你和冯先生
There are rumors that you and Mr. Feng

72
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,710
在去年五月的贸易峰会上进行了私下接触
served as back channels to the trade summit last May.

73
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,670
没错  就是"传言"
Exactly. Rumors.

74
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,010
峰会期间冯就在美国境内
We have Feng in the U.S. during the summit.

75
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,650
就算他做了私下接触
Well, if he was back-channeling,

76
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,340
就算我知情
and even if I were aware,

77
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,250
这种外交接触一般都是保密的
any form of diplomatic communication is usually classified.

78
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,220
你和总统说起过冯吗
Have you ever discussed Feng with the President?

79
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,820
北京每一个权势人物我们都会说起
Any major player in Beijing is worthy of discussion.

80
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,110
那就是承认了
So that's a yes.

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,730
只是陈述一般情况
It's a general comment.

82
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,730
你在能源危机期间与别人说起过他吗
Did you discuss him during the energy crisis?

83
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,830
我猜你是指跟他合资投资精炼厂的
I assuming you're alluding to the refinery co-venture with --

84
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,940
没错  我是指雷蒙德·塔斯克
Yes. With Raymond Tusk.

85
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,170
我们从来没聊起过精炼厂
The refinery was never part of our conversation.

86
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,240
我们要的是能立即见效的方案
We needed an immediate solution.

87
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,370
建精炼厂在短期内什么都解决不了
A refinery would have solved nothing in the short term.

88
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,160
而且据我所知  这交易最后黄了
And it's my understanding that deal fell through.

89
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,440
没错  但塔斯克拿到了补贴
Correct. But Tusk did receive a subsidy.

90
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,980
其他核电供应商也都拿到了
As did every other nuclear energy provider.

91
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,580
但他和冯有联系
But his connection with Feng,

92
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,600
还有钐补贴
then a subsidy on samarium --

93
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,660
没人从这笔补贴中获利
Nobody made any profits off these subsidies.

94
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,000
至多也就是保本而已
At best they were breaking even.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,350
事实上  雷蒙德一开始还反对补贴的事
In fact, Raymond fought us on the issue.

96
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,280
那我们再说说杰斐逊港大桥吧
Then let's back up to the Port Jefferson Bridge.

97
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,080
这也怨不得她  这的确值得担忧
I don't blame her. It's a valid concern.

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,100
告诉他我不会谈嘉乐威的事
Tell him I won't engage on Galloway,

99
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,500
所以干脆也别问
so there's no point in asking.

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,420
这可是马特·贝
This is Matt Bai.

101
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,560
他要问什么我们说了不算  而他肯定会问这个
We can't dictate what he'll ask. And he will ask.

102
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,080
那我就说我不会回应这些无聊八卦
Well, then I'll just say I won't answer tabloid questions.

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,630
这是个合理的问题
It's a legitimate question.

104
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,340
丑闻对选举有什么影响
How the scandal could affect the vote.

105
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,310
我建议我们也不做了
Look, I say you pull out, too.

106
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,780
取消掉整篇专题
We scrap the whole piece.

107
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,220
杰姬在和我们对着干
Jackie is fighting us.

108
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,890
总统方面又指望不上
The leadership is noncommittal.

109
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,570
我们需要这篇专访让大家重新关注法案
We need this article to refocus attention.

110
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,780
但这于你不利啊
But it'll hurt you.

111
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,610
对你的形象和法案都不利
Both your personal image and the bill.

112
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,450
但如果我们谁都不靠
But if we cut the cord,

113
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,490
约好的两场采访
we schedule two interviews,

114
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,600
就这么取消了  马特不会生气吗
then we cancel, won't Matt be furious?

115
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,220
那么大家只会看到我们的退缩
The story will be about pulling out.

116
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,680
我们要权衡利弊
We're talking about the lesser of two evils.

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,260
我不希望你成为目标
I don't want you to become the target,

118
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,720
-使我们的努力白费  -如果不是我去呢
- to undo all the work - Then what if it's not me at all?

119
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,120
可你说第一夫人不打算
But you said the first lady wasn't going --

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,740
不是她  是其他人
Not her. Someone else.

121
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,020
建设大桥是否是换取切断共和党资助金的筹码
Was the bridge a trade-off to prevent additional GOP funding?

122
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
据我所知
As far as I know,

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,240
这座大桥是总统在兑现
the bridge was a delivery on a promise

124
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,130
他对选民做出的承诺
the president had made to the voters.

125
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,830
还没问完吗
Are we finished here?

126
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,910
快了
Almost.

127
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,980
你会见过多少位国会议员  邓巴女士
How many members of Congress have you interviewed, Ms. Dunbar?

128
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,950
200吗
About 200?

129
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,320
194位
194.

130
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,410
我想帮忙
Well, I want to be of help,

131
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,790
但我想前面194位都已经说得差不多了
but I doubt I can offer any more than the 194 that preceded me.

132
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,270
我得到了一些有用的证词
I have gotten some useful testimony.

133
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,090
-从谁那儿  -众议院高层
- From who? - A high-ranking House member.

134
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,830
领导层的吗
In the leadership?

135
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,010
我不能说
I'm not at liberty to say.

136
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,270
鲍勃·博奇  杰姬·夏普
Bob Birch? Jackie Sharp?

137
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,140
这个人说他参加了7月14日
This individual says he attended a meeting

138
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,240
在总统办公室的会议
July 14th in the Oval Office.

139
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,390
她说是个男的  那么一定是博奇
She said "He," so it must have been Birch.

140
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,390
雷蒙德肯定能轻易收买他
I'm sure Raymond had no trouble buying him off.

141
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,050
你也参加了那次会议
You attended that meeting also.

142
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,670
看来是这样的
It appears so.

143
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,240
你还记得那次会议的主题吗
Do you recall the subject of that meeting?

144
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,920
一波共和党的攻击广告
A wave of conservative attack ads.

145
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,020
我们没有足够财力与之抗衡
We were being outspent.

146
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,120
你一定很震惊吧
It must have been quite a shock

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,000
拉尼根转而把钱捐给了另一党派
when Lanagin's tribe shifted contributions to the other party,

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,870
之前他们从没给共和党捐过钱
when they hadn't given a single dime to the Republicans before that.

149
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,800
这的确会令我们震惊
Well, it would have been a shock,

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,770
但我们当时并不知道钱是哪来的
but we didn't know where the money was coming from at the time.

151
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,950
据我的线人说
According to my source...

152
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,730
鲍勃·博奇
Bob Birch.

153
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,060
我的线人说  当时预计有两千五百万
My source says the estimate was 25 million.

154
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,400
引用你说的话
You said, and I quote,

155
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,990
"凭空出现这么多钱
"With this kind of influx,

156
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,660
肯定有人违规了"
you can be sure somebody isn't playing by the rules."

157
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,290
像是我说过的话
Sounds like something I might say.

158
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,170
鲍勃的记性比我好
Bob has a better memory than me.

159
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,480
杰斐逊港大桥刚获批
The money stopped just after

160
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,310
这笔钱就中断了
the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.

161
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,440
你是真有想法
Is there a theory here,

162
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,660
还是查不出头绪就瞎猜
or are you just grasping at straws?

163
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,280
大桥与冯有关
The bridge leads to Feng.

164
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,890
冯与拉尼根和塔斯克有关
Feng gives me Lanagin and Tusk.

165
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,060
塔斯克和总统
Tusk and the president --

166
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,600
邓巴女士  你想玩六度分隔的话
Ms. Dunbar, you want to play six degrees of separation,

167
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,570
还能扯上吉米·霍法和教皇
you could throw in Jimmy Hoffa and the pope.

168
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,570
{\an8}82年神秘失踪的工会领袖

169
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,280
那么一度分隔如何
Then how about one degree of separation?

170
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,240
道格拉斯·斯坦普  你的幕僚长
Douglas Stamper, your chief of staff.

171
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,170
这是7月14日他在拉尼根的赌场
This is him at Lanagin's casino July 14th.

172
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,820
我用这些申请了搜查证  调出了飞行记录
I used these to get a warrant for flight records.

173
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,020
第二天  斯坦普先生飞去北京
The next day, Mr. Stamper was on a flight to Beijing.

174
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,350
他为什么去赌场
Why was he at the casino?

175
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,010
为什么去北京
And why was he in Beijing?

176
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,660
我想与委托人谈谈
I would like to speak to my client.

177
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,980
请吧
Please.

178
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,880
我很努力
I work hard.

179
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,630
我不拖泥带水  我知道重要的是什么
I keep things simple. I know what my priorities are.

180
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,010
但是有这么个人
But there's this -- this person.

181
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,060
她不在我的生活中  而是在我生活的边缘
She's not even in my life, except on the edges,

182
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,570
所以界限很模糊
making things blurrier.

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
这并不让我想喝酒
It doesn't tempt me to drink.

184
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,080
那感觉更像...
It's more like she --

185
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,270
她给我的感觉就像我喝酒时的感觉
it's more like she feels what it was like when I was drinking.

186
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,110
总是无法满足
When I couldn't get enough.

187
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,770
不管我喝多少酒
No matter how many drinks I had,

188
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,000
总是喝不够
I wanted another.

189
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,650
我不想和她在一起
I -- I don't want to be with her.

190
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,870
我是说  我想
I mean, I -- I -- I do.

191
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,810
但是
But

192
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,690
她更像是我女儿
it's more like she's my daughter.

193
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,710
或者我母亲
Or my mother.

194
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,860
我也不知道了  太乱了
I don't know. This is fucked up.

195
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,390
慢慢说
Take your time.

196
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,820
我不该再跟她联系了
I should cut her off.

197
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,920
就像戒酒一样
The way I did with booze.

198
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,720
就这些  说完了
That's all. I'm done.

199
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,640
谢谢你与我们分享
Thanks for sharing.

200
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,870
我们需要一些时间回答你的问题
We'll need some time before responding to your questions.

201
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,370
我愿意等
I could wait as long as necessary.

202
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,430
可能要花上一段时间
It could take a while.

203
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,970
事关国家安全
There are national security matters at stake.

204
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,950
副总统需要咨询顾问
The vice president needs to consult with his advisors.

205
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,930
国家安全
National security?

206
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,670
你真要用这招吗  奥利弗
Are you really gonna play that card, Oliver?

207
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,920
他的回答可能涉及保密信息
His answers could entail classified material.

208
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,480
我们什么时候能得到回应
When can we expect a response?

209
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,540
我会通知你的
I'll let you know.

210
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,650
我们可以拿走这些截屏照片吗
May we hold onto the screen cap?

211
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
请便
Be my guest.

212
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,960
我们会尽快联系你  邓巴女士
We'll be in touch soon, Ms. Dunbar.

213
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,210
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President?

214
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,450
不要认为你这就没事了
If you think you're insulated, don't.

215
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,930
我们调查的不止道格拉斯·斯坦普
Our investigation is much bigger than Douglas Stamper.

216
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,450
就到这儿吧  邓巴女士
That's enough, Ms. Dunbar.

217
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,530
多谢你的配合  副总统先生
Thank you for your time, Mr. Vice President.

218
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,820
乐意合作
Happy to cooperate.

219
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,740
刚出虎口  又入狼窝
From the lion's den to a pack of wolves.

220
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,010
如果你是滴血的肉  那就杀了别人
When you're fresh meat, kill,

221
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,870
给他们更新鲜的肉
and throw them something fresher.

222
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,740
你好  我是菲茨
Hey, I'm Fitz.

223
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,980
道格
Doug.

224
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,730
你要知道  你可以自己硬挺着
Yeah, you know, uh, you can isolate,

225
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,590
独自承担这一切
white-knuckle this shit if you want.

226
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,440
或者你也可以向他人求助
Or you can ask for help.

227
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,770
你有担保人吗
Got a sponsor?

228
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,300
不用  都已经14年了  我没事
No. It's been 14 years. I'm good.

229
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,730
电话在背面  如果你改主意的话
Number's on the back, if you change your mind.

230
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,760
我以为你有司机
Thought you had a driver.

231
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,600
我有
I do.

232
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,230
我不希望他听到什么
I didn't want him overhearing anything.

233
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,930
你根本就不该来这个州
You shouldn't even be near this state.

234
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,410
我不在这儿
I'm not really here.

235
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,180
去加州绕了点远路
Long layover on my way to California.

236
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,640
稽核员
I've got auditors,

237
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,670
和联邦探员都在我办公室
federal agents in my office,

238
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,150
查看每一份文件和档案
going through every file, every document.

239
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,700
他们连我的垃圾都翻
They're going through my god damn trash.

240
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,140
如果她传唤你就坚持保持沉默
Just stick to the Fifth if she subpoenas you.

241
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,980
他们怎么知道去查斯坦普
Well, how do they know to look for Stamper?

242
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,080
专查那天的录像
To search the tapes on that exact day?

243
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,980
别乱下结论
Don't jump to conclusions.

244
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,320
你这是要牺牲我
You're throwing me under the bus.

245
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,910
安德伍德才是对头  你不是
Underwood's the roadkill. Not you.

246
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,530
他们要坑我
They're going to fuck me.

247
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,590
他们会找到办法
They'll find a way.

248
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,990
-而且你也知情  -如果是那样
- And you know that. - And if that's the case,

249
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,120
你和你的家人会得到妥善安置
you and your family will be taken care of.

250
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,590
他们已经给我提供认罪条件了
They're already offering me a plea.

251
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,830
你还没被起诉呢
You haven't even been charged yet.

252
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,550
如果我合作的话
If I cooperate.

253
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,460
你能少坐几年牢
You'll do less time,

254
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,070
但你的家人会一无所有
but your family will have nothing.

255
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,340
等你出来他们还是一无所有
They'll still have nothing when you get out.

256
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,610
你作证指认雷蒙德
You testify against Raymond,

257
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,120
他也不会有事  因为他们只有你的证词作证据
and he'll still walk because all they'll have is your word.

258
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,030
而现在你的证词没多少可信度
And that doesn't count for much right now.

259
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,320
他要是不害怕你就不会来了
You wouldn't be here if he wasn't afraid.

260
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
我来不是因为他害怕了
I'm not here because he's afraid.

261
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,280
是因为你害怕了
I'm here because you are.

262
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,900
我要确定你不会做蠢事
And I want to make sure you don't do anything stupid.

263
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,960
在反复和北京沟通后
After repeated conversations with Beijing

264
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,190
他们坚持他们的立场
they remain intractable in their position.

265
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,170
我今早命令一个航母战斗群
This morning I gave orders for a carrier group

266
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,140
在冲绳海域重新部署
to reposition near Okinawa.

267
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,900
这样我们的舰只不会直接
This won't put our ships in direct confrontation

268
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
和中国军舰对峙
with the Chinese vessels,

269
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,270
但又能把对方纳入航母空袭范围
but it will put them within reach of airstrikes.

270
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,270
我今天晚些时候会知会中国大使
I'll be informing the Chinese ambassador later today.

271
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,570
我们会和五角大楼联合发表声明
We'll release a statement in coordination with the Pentagon.

272
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,830
先生  我们的钐储量
Sir, our stockpiles of samarium

273
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,170
最多能再坚持两个月
will only last another two months at most.

274
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,790
如果我们这么做
If we go this route --

275
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,270
我已经知道所有人的担忧
Yeah, I've -- I've heard everyone's concerns.

276
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,500
这是我的决定
And this is the decision I've made.

277
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,710
有问题吗
Any questions?

278
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,760
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

279
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,990
弗兰克
Frank.

280
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,180
进行的怎么样
How'd it go?

281
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,120
我们有些问题需要后续澄清
We have a few follow-up questions that we have to address.

282
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
比如什么
Like what?

283
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,690
没什么要紧的
Oh, nothing major.

284
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,960
就是零七碎八  一点细节
Just odds and ends. A few details.

285
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,320
我以为这调查会简短而温和
I was under the impression this would be short and sweet.

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,110
我也以为  但她不依不饶
So was I, but she's very deliberate.

287
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,820
这事得尽快平息  弗兰克
We need this over, Frank.

288
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,950
至少要尽快撇清跟白宫的关系
At least as far as the White House is concerned.

289
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,140
我们不能分心
We can't be distracted.

290
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,590
特别是局势如此紧张的时候
Not with warships on the move.

291
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,730
我确信马上就会结束了
I'm confident we're in the home stretch.

292
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,640
你看上去不像嘴上说得那么轻松
Well, you seem more concerned than you're letting on.

293
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,520
不  完全没有
Oh, no, not at all.

294
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,670
你在搓手
You're fidgeting.

295
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,790
是我的毕业戒指
It's my class ring.

296
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,090
我忘了我...
I forget I --

297
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,730
我把它埋了
I buried it.

298
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,740
什么
You what?

299
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,610
说来话长了
I -- it's a long story.

300
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,600
我从没见过你这么紧张  弗兰克
I've never seen you this stressed before, Frank.

301
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,230
我从没见过您这么疲惫  先生
Well, I've never seen you this tired before, sir.

302
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,070
您也有自己的圈
You've got rings of your own.

303
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,800
黑眼圈
Dark ones.

304
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,020
越发明显了  是吗
Yeah, they're getting worse, aren't they?

305
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,670
您该在总统办公室的沙发上多打打盹
You should take more naps on those sofas in the Oval.

306
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,340
如今光打盹可管不了用了  弗兰克
Oh, naps don't cut it these days, Frank.

307
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,520
一点都解不了乏
Not even a dent.

308
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,370
谎话连篇
Lie after lie.

309
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,140
先是对检察官  现在是对总统
First to a prosecutor, then to a president.

310
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,960
我觉得我全无防护
I feel exposed.

311
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,320
就像我手指上曾被戒指庇护的皮肤
Like the skin where my ring used to be.

312
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,370
强如阿喀琉斯  也终因踵上一箭毙命
Even Achilles was only as strong as his heel.

313
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,500
道格在哪  他老不接电话
Where's Doug? He's not answering his phone.

314
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,980
他去参加互助会了  先生
He went to a meeting, sir.

315
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,020
大白天的去干什么
In the middle of the day?

316
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,360
他现在可能在往回赶了
I think he's on his way back now.

317
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,280
我要他赶紧回来
I want him back now as soon as possible.

318
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,770
先生  这是给你的
Sir, this arrived for you.

319
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,440
是雷米跳槽去格兰顿-希尔时你送给他的手表
The watch you gave Remy when he left for Glendon Hill.

320
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,750
我从手表背面的名言认出来的
I recognized it from the quote on the back.

321
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,000
他留信息了吗
Was there a message?

322
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,660
没有  只有这块表
No. Just the watch.

323
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,780
赶紧联系道格
Let's find Doug.

324
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,930
好的  先生
Right away, sir.

325
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,460
希望你不介意塑料杯子
Forgive the plastic.

326
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,840
吕克·图伊曼斯  他有真本事
Luc Tuymans. He's the real thing.

327
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,820
那我就信你了
Well, I'll take your word.

328
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,920
这不是我的  这些全都不是
It's not mine. None of it.

329
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,500
在加州  你要是想卖房子
California, you want to sell your house,

330
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,150
你的房屋中介会先装修一番
your realtor decorates it.

331
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,690
起码会装个样板间
Well, one room at least.

332
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,590
你打算搬到哪去
Where you moving?

333
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,260
我在索诺玛有座小农场
Oh, I have a little ranch in Sonoma.

334
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,470
我妻子离开了
My wife's gone.

335
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,640
我的孩子也不和我说话
My kids won't talk to me.

336
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,700
至少我还有我的画
But at least I'll have my painting.

337
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,710
你还画画吗
You paint?

338
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,860
不画  农场也是胡扯
No. And there's no ranch.

339
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,900
但其余的话  其余的都是真的
But the rest of it -- the rest of it's true.

340
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,010
干杯
Cheers.

341
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,020
我是为杰奎琳·夏普而来
I'm here about Jacqueline Sharp.

342
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,470
我们在考虑雇用她
We're thinking of hiring her.

343
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,810
做说客吗
A lobbyist?

344
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,010
她可能赢不了连任竞选了
She could lose her re-elect.

345
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,060
现在局势对在位者不利
Not a great time to be an incumbent.

346
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,750
我知道你和她关系很近
I know you two are close.

347
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,920
你来是想要什么
So, you're looking for what?

348
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,250
推荐函吗
A recommendation?

349
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,170
我们是K街员工流动率最低的一家
We have the lowest turnover of any shop on K Street.

350
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,170
{\an8}K街上有很多智囊公司  游说公司和倡导团体

351
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,170
这是有原因的
There's a reason.

352
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,280
格兰顿-希尔想用什么样的人
What are you looking for at Glendon Hill?

353
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,680
心狠手辣的人
A killer instinct.

354
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,770
那你找她算是找对人了
Well, she certainly has that.

355
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,160
恕我直言
Forgive me if I'm prying,

356
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,910
但是不是她造成了你的...
but did she have anything to do with your, uh...

357
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,210
出局
Departure?

358
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,260
杰姬做了她必须做的事
Jackie did what she had to do.

359
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,710
我永远不会原谅她
I'll never forgive her.

360
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,590
但我理解她为什么要这么做
But I understand why she did it.

361
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,260
她究竟做了什么
Did what exactly?

362
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,890
我用现金买的票
I paid cash for my ticket.

363
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,280
我非常谨慎
I was careful.

364
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,990
显然不够谨慎
Clearly not enough.

365
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,160
先生  赌场里到处是摄像头
Sir, the casino had cameras everywhere.

366
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,590
我根本无法避开
There was no way to avoid them.

367
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,720
但他们的监控录像肯定有几千小时
But there had to have been thousands of hours of footage.

368
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,540
他们怎么找出来的...
Now how they found that --

369
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,450
有个问题我必须要问  道格
I have to ask you a question, Doug.

370
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,230
我很抱歉  但你要如实作答
And I'm sorry, but I need you to be honest.

371
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,130
你是不是又开始酗酒了
Are you drinking again?

372
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,050
当然没有
God no.

373
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,110
真的吗
Truly?

374
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,060
想都没想过
It's not an option.

375
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,030
你最近的表现可很像喝醉了
Because it would explain a lot.

376
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,270
你完全有权生气
You have every right to be upset.

377
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,830
-这是我的错  -我已经顾不上生气了
- This was my fault. - I'm more concerned than I'm upset.

378
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,030
我现在需要你  道格
I need you now, Doug.

379
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,280
非常需要
More than ever.

380
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,470
我明白
I know.

381
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,790
你我都不年轻了
We're not young men.

382
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,460
一旦失败  都会老死在牢里
If we fail, we'll die in a cage.

383
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,660
我最近不在状态
I haven't been myself lately.

384
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,130
你14年前也是这么说的
That's what you said to me 14 years ago.

385
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,700
我给了你第二次机会  也收获了回报
When I gave you a second chance, it paid off.

386
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,310
你戒酒了  道格
You got clean, Doug.

387
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,630
这份工作是我最看重的  先生  无比重要
Nothing means more to me than this job, sir. Nothing.

388
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,540
无论发生了什么
Whatever's going on,

389
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,390
我要知道你能搞定
I need to know that it can be managed.

390
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,930
如果你需要我的帮助
And if you need my help,

391
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,330
我会伸出援手
I'm here to help you.

392
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,410
我没事  先生
I'm good, sir.

393
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,520
我能解决好  局面会好转的
I can handle myself. Things'll be different.

394
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,690
我从没给过别人第三次机会
I've never given someone a third chance.

395
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,690
但现在我再给你一次机会
Until this very moment.

396
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,740
我非常感激
And I'm grateful.

397
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,280
我不会让你后悔的
You won't regret it.

398
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,030
请相信这一点  先生
Please believe that, sir.

399
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,410
是雷米让他们找到录像的
It was Remy who alerted them to the footage.

400
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,900
这是他的离职礼物
His going-away gift.

401
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,830
读读背面
Read the back.

402
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,630
你觉得他想传达什么信息
What do you think he's trying to say?

403
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,250
我不知道  找到他  给我安排一次会面
I don't know, but track him down and set up a meeting.

404
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,070
邓巴那边怎么办
What about Dunbar?

405
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,430
我们没法逃开事实
We can't run from the facts.

406
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,160
你让我说什么  我就说什么
I'll say whatever you want me to say.

407
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,250
我负全责
I'll take responsibility for all of it.

408
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,600
她可能会起诉你
She could indict you.

409
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,540
幕僚就是做这个的
That's what having a staff is for.

410
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,960
我有个更好的解决办法
I have a better solution.

411
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,890
-我们一起承担责任  -怎么做
- We'll both take responsibility. - How?

412
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,170
后天和邓巴安排一次会面
Set up an interview with Dunbar. Day after tomorrow.

413
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,200
-我们俩需要时间做足准备  -是  先生
- You and I need time to do our homework. - Yes, sir.

414
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,680
这是什么时候弄的
When did this happen?

415
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,030
密查姆帮我修好了
Meechum helped me fix it.

416
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,510
如果他们不让我跑步  我总得想办法健身
If they're not gonna let me run, I have to work out some way.

417
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,940
你把它搬上楼了
You carried it all the way up here?

418
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,140
更隐秘  有人帮我
For privacy. I had help.

419
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,670
-密查姆  -没错
- Meechum. - That's right.

420
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,490
他还真是样样通
Well, he's a jack of all trades.

421
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,020
-工匠  搬家具的  -肉盾
- Handyman. Furniture mover. - Human shield.

422
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,840
有多糟
How bad is it?

423
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,080
很糟
Bad.

424
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,430
他们有证据证明道格出现在不该出现的地方
They have evidence of Doug being where he shouldn't have been.

425
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,890
你打算怎么办
What are you gonna do?

426
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,970
讲实话
Tell the truth.

427
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,320
-你该不会真打算...  -不是全部
- You're not actually gonna -- - Selectively.

428
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,850
别担心
Don't worry.

429
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
不过绊了一下  还没摔倒
It's a stumble, not a fall.

430
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,100
如果只是绊一下  你不会这个样子
You aren't like this when it's just a stumble.

431
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,110
-什么样子  -你害怕了  我看得出来
- Like how? - You're scared. I can tell.

432
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,750
1分39秒划五百米  这是我的最佳成绩
500 meters at 1:39. That was my best.

433
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,350
以此为目标吧
Shoot for that.

434
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,070
你怎么样
How have you been?

435
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,160
挺好
Okay.

436
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,910
-药挺有用的  -那就好
- The meds are helping. - Oh, that's good to hear.

437
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,760
坐吧
Let's have a seat.

438
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,660
街角那些人
Those people at the end of the street...

439
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,050
闹得挺厉害
it's intense.

440
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,300
他们一天到晚不消停  周末人数还翻番
They're there 24/7. Twice as many on the weekends.

441
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,320
我们现在都习惯了
We're so used to it by now.

442
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,700
我能脱鞋吗
Can I take off my shoes?

443
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,770
我觉得该穿得正式点  但我真不喜欢高跟鞋
I thought I should dress up, but I am not good with heels.

444
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,040
行  当然可以
Yes. Of course.

445
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,950
我妈妈说和裙子很搭
My mom said they went with the dress.

446
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,390
舒服多了
Much better.

447
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,030
梅根
Look, Megan,

448
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,180
我知道过去六个月很难熬
I know the last six months have been difficult,

449
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,870
但我需要你的帮助
but I need your help.

450
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,440
我们没能像预想的那样得到领导层的支持
We just don't have the support that we expected in the leadership.

451
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,020
我也猜到你不会只是想问问我的近况
Yeah, I figured this wasn't just about checking up on me.

452
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,950
你之前改过主意  我理解
You changed your mind before, and I understand why.

453
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,390
但现在你的情况似乎稳定多了
But now it seems as though things are more stable with you.

454
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,510
你愿意吗
Are you willing?

455
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,880
我都坐在你家了  说不有点过意不去
It's hard to say no when I'm in your house.

456
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,800
你也听到了外头那些人
Well, you hear those people out there.

457
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,020
他们声音很响  但我们要发出更高的声音
They're loud, but I think we need to be louder.

458
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,490
但这声音不能是我的
And it can't be my voice,

459
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,990
因为我已经是婴儿杀手  和出轨者
because I'm the baby killer, the cheater.

460
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,650
这声音得是你发出的
It needs to be your voice.

461
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,990
因为你没有污点
A clear voice.

462
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,180
我已经在军事法庭上作证了
I'm already testifying at the court martial.

463
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,830
但那里不对媒体开放
But that's closed to the media.

464
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,230
还不够
It's not enough.

465
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,910
这种事曾发生在很多人身上
There are so many people this has happened to.

466
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,050
为什么一定是我
Why does it have to be me?

467
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,980
因为是你打来了电话
Because you're the one who called.

468
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,670
你打算在麦金尼斯判刑之前发表吗
Are you gonna try to put it out before McGinnis gets sentenced?

469
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,820
赛斯  有空吗
Seth? You have a minute?

470
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,510
马特  我一会儿打给你
Matt, I have to call you back.

471
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,220
关门
Close the door.

472
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,020
副总统录用你的时候
When the vice president brought you on board,

473
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,490
我是反对的
I advised against it.

474
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,190
但我不得不承认你干得很好
But I can't deny you've done a good job.

475
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,930
谢谢你这么说
I appreciate you saying that.

476
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,620
我一直很注重保护副总统
I'm very protective of the vice president.

477
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,650
我很难跟旁人分担这份职责
I find it hard to share that duty with anyone else,

478
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,110
这也导致我可能出错
which leaves me open to error.

479
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,980
这是我的缺点之一
It's one of my faults.

480
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,400
正如我跟副总统说的那样
As I told the vice president,

481
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,130
我知道信任需要我自己争取
I understand that trust is something that I need to earn.

482
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,130
而且我得到工作的途径不正
And given how I got the job --

483
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,470
如果副总统信任你  那我就信任你
If the vice president trusts you, then I trust you.

484
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,460
我们现在是一个团队
We're a team now.

485
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,350
而且我也没法孤军奋战
And the truth is I can't do this alone.

486
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,070
要我做任何事都行
Anything and everything you ask of me.

487
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,790
可能与媒体无关
It might have nothing to do with the media.

488
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,440
新闻发言人不过是个名号
Press Secretary is just a title.

489
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,510
很好
Good.

490
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,120
我们有两个任务
We have two tasks.

491
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,520
首先  找到雷米·丹顿
First, find me Remy Danton.

492
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,340
但要小心
But be discreet.

493
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,080
我去找他
I'll track him down.

494
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,470
其次  我要你翻阅副总统的行程记录
Second, I need you to go through the Vice President's travel logs.

495
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,960
过去十年的所有记录
Everything in the past 10 years.

496
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,110
我们要找什么
What are we looking for?

497
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,620
任何软肋
Anything that could hurt us.

498
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,720
我从前往后找
I'll work forward.

499
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,710
你从后往前
You work backward.

500
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,740
马上去办  还有道格
I'm on it. And Doug?

501
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,340
谢谢
Thanks.

502
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,730
南茜  帮我订部新手机 
Nancy, I need you to order me a new phone.

503
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,210
你说是"零七碎八""马上就会结束"
You said "Odds and ends." The "Home stretch."

504
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,410
我几个小时前才看到了这些内容
I was presented with this information just hours ago.

505
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,060
这是能招致弹劾的罪行  弗兰克
We're talking about impeachable offenses, Frank.

506
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,990
完全不会  先生
Not at all, sir.

507
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,010
你的幕僚长...
Your Chief of Staff was --

508
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,860
我当时觉得赌场跟这事有关
I had a gut feeling that the casino was involved.

509
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,570
我派道格去查了
I sent Doug down there to get to the bottom of it.

510
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,790
你一发现联系就该马上去找司法部
You should have taken this to the DOJ the first inkling you had --

511
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,860
我当时就不想那么做
That's exactly what I didn't want.

512
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,930
万一没有什么  我却制造事端
To create some ruckus if nothing was going on?

513
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,620
你不能私自调查  弗兰克
You can't go on conducting your own investigations, Frank.

514
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,950
查明真相  尽职调查  随您怎么说
Fact-finding, due diligence, whatever you want to call it.

515
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,430
如果有任何违法行为  我必须知道
If any laws were being broken, I wanted to know.

516
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,580
你就要这么跟邓巴说吗
And that's what you want to tell Dunbar.

517
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,980
我不想透露我们的外交手段
That I didn't want to disclose our diplomatic protocols.

518
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,700
我担心中期选举
That I was concerned about the midterms.

519
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,560
我还想保护美国总统
And that I wanted to protect the President of the United States.

520
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,380
或许我做得不对
Now, maybe what I did was wrong,

521
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,190
但我没干任何违法的事
but I didn't do anything illegal.

522
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,870
你确定
You certain of that?

523
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,050
我跟我的律师认真探讨过了
I've discussed this at length with my lawyers.

524
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,840
即使我们承认这一切
Dunbar does not strike me as the sort of person

525
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,640
我觉得邓巴也不会就此打住
who will put on the brakes, even if we admit all of this.

526
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,350
反而还可能促使她继续深挖
In fact, it might encourage her to dig deeper.

527
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,510
说得对
You're right.

528
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,700
所以我打算上交我全部的行程记录
Which is why I want to hand over all of my travel logs.

529
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,210
我觉得您也该这么做
And I think you should, too.

530
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,040
自愿上交吗
Volunteer them?

531
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,620
是的  表示我们乐意合作
Yeah. As a gesture of cooperation.

532
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,270
我们表示做得够多了
Haven't we made enough gestures?

533
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,390
这样她就不会那么叫劲了
That'll take the wind outta her sails.

534
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,970
不  我不想让她
No. I don't, uh, want her,

535
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,930
仔细查看我所有的行踪
uh, poring over every one of my comings and goings.

536
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,460
他是在担心他的婚姻咨询
He's worried about his marriage counseling,

537
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,800
他也该担心
as he should be.

538
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,780
如果您是在担心您的婚姻咨询
If you're worried about your marriage counseling,

539
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,620
您不必担心
you shouldn't be.

540
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,600
如果被外界知道  会造成多大影响
Imagine the fallout if the public were to find out that --

541
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,540
那是大海里的一根针
A needle in a haystack,

542
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,370
还不是邓巴要找的那根
and not a needle that Dunbar is looking for.

543
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,490
她已经会见了一半的国会议员
She's interviewed half of Congress.

544
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,540
这女人是要见血
That woman's after blood.

545
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,830
而不是八卦
But not for gossip.

546
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,480
就算她真的起疑了
And even if she does raise an eyebrow,

547
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,010
您只是去探望一位生病的朋友  不是吗
you were visiting a sick friend, weren't you?

548
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,460
是的  表面上是这样
Yeah, ostensibly.

549
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,440
这她没什么可说的
Well, she couldn't possibly find any fault with that.

550
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,110
叫嘉利克过来
I'd like Galich in here.

551
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,550
那我就不打扰了
I'll let you two talk privately.

552
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,840
你什么时候去见邓巴
When are you seeing Dunbar?

553
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,580
明天  这样您也有时间准备
Tomorrow, so you have some time.

554
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,950
我会跟比尔谈谈  回头找你
Well, I'll speak to Bill and get back to you.

555
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,390
他会建议您不要这么做  这是他职责所在
He'll advise you against it, which is his job.

556
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,460
但我会强烈建议您想想政治而不是法律
But I would just encourage you to think politics and not legalese.

557
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,860
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

558
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,290
议员女士
Congresswoman?

559
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,720
我为什么要投票给你
Why should I vote for you?

560
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,300
没事  马克
It's -- it's okay, Mark.

561
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,410
晚安
Goodnight.

562
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,500
你看起来很疲惫
You look tired.

563
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,650
忙了一天竞选吗
Long day on the campaign trail?

564
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,420
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

565
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,040
你没跟我说过哈维梅耶女儿的事
You never told me about Havemeyer's daughter.

566
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,260
大家都知道
Everyone knows that.

567
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,740
全世界都知道
The whole world knows.

568
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,750
但不知道你常去探望她
But not that you visited her.

569
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,450
而且是你泄露出去的
That you leaked it.

570
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,940
你大老远跑来加州就是为了问我这些
You came all the way to California to ask me about that?

571
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,090
我是到了加州才知道的
I came to California to find out about that.

572
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,560
我提出买下哈维梅耶的房子
I offered to buy Havemeyer's house,

573
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,040
但他就那么告诉我了
but he told me for nothing.

574
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,350
你说得对
You were right.

575
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,680
我确实忙了一天竞选
It has been a long day on the trail.

576
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,060
现在还不相上下
It's still a close race.

577
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,650
要是选民知道你是怎么当上党鞭就不会了
But not if the voters know how you became whip.

578
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,270
你这是在威胁我吗
Are you honestly threatening me?

579
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,310
安排和弗兰克的会面
Set up a meeting with Frank.

580
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,370
我不在乎你怎么说
I don't care what you talk about,

581
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,020
只要是你单独一人  会面也有记录就行
long as you're alone and the meeting is on the books.

582
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,320
然后你去和邓巴谈
Then you're gonna sit down with Dunbar.

583
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,600
她已经问完我了
I've already done my interview.

584
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,630
告诉她  是弗兰克逼你那么说的
Tell her Frank grilled you on your testimony.

585
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,800
作伪证吗
Perjure myself?

586
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,950
保住你的位子
Save your seat.

587
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,100
你说出去吧
You know what? Tell everyone.

588
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,710
想想那会有什么后果
Think how that'd play out.

589
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,070
我不在乎
I don't care.

590
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,040
你真要为了弗兰克毁了自己吗
You'd really toss yourself off a cliff for Frank?

591
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,820
我不效忠于弗兰克·安德伍德
I have zero allegiance for Frank Underwood.

592
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,450
我不会受他操纵
I won't be manipulated by him.

593
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,850
我更不会被你操纵
And I sure as fuck won't be manipulated by you.

594
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,120
我不是虚张声势
I'm not bluffing.

595
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,300
那我就是对的
Then I was right.

596
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,160
关于什么
About what?

597
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,690
你根本不在乎我
How little I meant.

598
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,520
那跟这个没关系
That has nothing to do with this.

599
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,010
当然有关系
It has everything to do with this.

600
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,990
我应该觉得恶心  但我没有
I should feel disgusted, but I don't.

601
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,030
只是特别失望
Just supremely disappointed.

602
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,170
我们十分钟前接到电话
We got the call 10 minutes ago.

603
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,260
直接从白宫顾问那里打来的
Direct from the White House counsel.

604
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,740
总统要上交一切吗
The President's turning over everything?

605
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,830
从他就职那天开始
From the day he took office.

606
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,560
肯定会包括他去拜访那位朋友吗
And we're sure this includes the visits to his friend?

607
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,760
当然  安保人员全部出动
It has to. It was full security detail.

608
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,260
老天啊
Phenomenal.

609
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,740
我们有下手的地方了
We have something we can work with.

610
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,000
关于我的记录...
Now, as for my logs...

611
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,110
没有问题
They're clean.

612
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,720
你拿生命打包票吗
You'd bet your life on that?

613
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,880
是的
I would.

614
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,980
我也是  先生
Me, too, sir.

615
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,240
我们已经检查了两次  反复检查
We've been through 'em twice, backward and forward.

616
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,390
我的声明呢
My statement?

617
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,570
在你的收件箱里
In your inbox.

618
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,700
我看过了  塞斯干得很漂亮
I looked it over. Seth did a nice job.

619
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,090
会面一结束我们就要把消息发布出去
We need to go wide with this the moment the interview's over,

620
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,390
这样邓巴如果打算发布什么消息
so that we beat Dunbar to the punch

621
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,150
我们可以先发制人
in case she decides to release something.

622
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,880
我会守在电脑前
I'll be at my computer,

623
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,710
一收到道格的消息就按下"发送"键
ready to press "Send" the moment I hear from Doug.

624
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,920
你们俩睡过觉吗
Have either of you slept?

625
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,320
我们很清醒  全速运转
We're awake. Fully operational.

626
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,500
你去洗个澡  换件衣服
You take a shower and put on a fresh suit.

627
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,590
是  先生  我们在那边见
Yes, sir. I'll see you over there.

628
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,700
你有至少三小时
You have at least three hours.

629
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,390
打个盹吧  去我办公室睡
Take a nap. You can use my office.

630
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,720
你作证的时候麦金尼斯将军就在法庭里
General McGinnis was in the courtroom when you testified.

631
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,950
是的
Yes.

632
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,420
你私下见过他吗
Had you seen him in person --

633
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,740
在他侵犯你之后
I mean, since he assaulted you?

634
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,240
没有
No.

635
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,830
那是什么感觉
So what was that like?

636
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,190
不愉快
Not fun.

637
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,780
怎么个不愉快
Not fun how?

638
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,810
很难受  真的很难受
It was hard. Really hard.

639
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,740
听着  梅根
Look, Megan,

640
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,170
我同意把文章的焦点转移到你身上
I -- I agreed to change the focus of my piece to focus on you,

641
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,890
我也知道这肯定很难
and, you know, I know this has gotta be hard.

642
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,650
但你得帮帮我
I need you to help me out a little bit.

643
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,200
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

644
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,830
我不是很擅长这个  我很紧张
I'm not very good at this. I'm nervous.

645
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,470
你打电话去安德伍德夫人的访谈时挺好的
You seemed fine when you called into Mrs. Underwood's interview.

646
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,860
她在电话那头跟我在一起
She was there with me on the phone.

647
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,690
你的紧张情绪
Your nerves.

648
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,070
我知道自你被侵犯后  这一直是个问题
I know that's been an issue since the assault.

649
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,330
那种防御心理
The defense brought up

650
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,280
引起了情绪与精神的不稳定
what they called emotional and mental instability.

651
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,530
总是那样
That's what always happens.

652
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,900
被攻击的人会再次被攻击
The person who was attacked gets attacked all over again.

653
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,560
你有什么感觉
How did that make you feel?

654
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,900
让我觉得愤怒
It made me angry.

655
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,270
律师一直问我恐慌症的事
The lawyer kept coming after me about my panic attacks,

656
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,540
和我的抗抑郁药
my antidepressants.

657
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,170
但我只是紧紧盯着麦金尼斯
But I just kept staring at McGinnis.

658
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,320
我想让他知道我能承受
I wanted him to see I could take it.

659
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,650
我很坚强
That I was strong.

660
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,100
我想让他先转过脸去
I wanted to make him look away first.

661
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,440
他有吗
And did he?

662
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,120
是的  当我说到他不只是侵犯了我的身体
Yes. When I said he did more than violate my body.

663
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,760
还背叛了自己的国家
He betrayed his country.

664
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,130
毁了海军陆战队的声誉
He robbed it of a good Marine.

665
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
我们谈谈国会正在谈论的
Let's talk about the Sexual Assault Bill

666
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,960
性侵法案吧
that's in front of Congress right now.

667
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,920
有人提出了很强烈的反对意见
You know it's taken some significant opposition,

668
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,890
尤其是另一个老兵
most notably from another veteran,

669
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,130
杰奎琳·夏普
Jacqueline Sharp.

670
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,560
要我说  她也背叛了自己的国家
If you ask me, she's betraying her country, too.

671
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,110
邓巴女士
Ms. Dunbar.

672
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,950
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

673
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,040
谢谢你多给我们几天时间
Thank you for giving us a few extra days.

674
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
耐心对我来说不是问题
I have no problem being patient,

675
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,050
只要能因此得到坦率的回答
as long as it leads to forthright answers.

676
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,080
我不会让你继续等待了
Well, I won't make you wait a moment longer.

677
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,400
可以开始了吗
Shall we?

678
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,870
你找到这里了
Oh, you found it.

679
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,440
请坐
Have a seat.

680
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,690
我们马上就完事了
We're just finishing up here.

681
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,130
你觉得怎么样  塔斯克先生
What do you think, Mr. Tusk?

682
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,430
留着还是剃了
Keep growing it or have it shaved?

683
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,010
还是留着吧
Ah, I guess I'll keep growing it.

684
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:38,790
没问题
Ah, no problem.

685
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,100
我把后面清理一下
Let me just clean up the back here.

686
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,850
不了  麦克  让我们单独待会儿
No, Mack, if you'd give me a couple of minutes.

687
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,260
谢了
Appreciate it.

688
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,870
大概十年前我在这里建造了这个地方
I had this place built down here about 10 years ago.

689
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,270
我厌倦了每两周都要开车穿过整个城市
I got tired of driving all the way across town every two weeks.

690
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,210
现在坐个电梯就到了
Now it's just an elevator ride.

691
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,460
真方便
Convenient.

692
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,320
你知道不方便的是什么吗
You know what isn't convenient?

693
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,370
在我办公室里挤下八个律师
Cramming eight attorneys into my office.

694
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,220
那里不是为召集我律所所有合伙人准备的
It was not designed for the entire partnership of my law firm.

695
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,910
他们比较担心拉尼根
They're worried about Lanagin.

696
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,900
他有点害怕  但他能挺住
He's a little shaky, but he'll hold up.

697
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,370
安德伍德
Underwood?

698
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,560
博奇出手了
Birch delivered.

699
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,670
邓巴提出斯坦普的问题了吧
And did Dunbar bring up Stamper?

700
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,960
会面是闭门的
The sessions are closed-door,

701
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,670
不过我想她肯定会提的
but I can't imagine she didn't.

702
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,970
那可怜的哈维梅耶那边呢
And what about poor Havemeyer?

703
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,200
他在杰姬·夏普的事上对我们有帮助吗
Was he any help to us on Jackie Sharp?

704
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,920
你的犹豫说明进展不顺吧
I do not take your hesitation as a promising sign.

705
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,300
我向来不喜欢让你失望
I never like disappointing you.

706
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,950
他什么都不知道吗
He had nothing.

707
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,020
不知道
No.

708
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,030
你觉得他是确实不知道呢
Now, do you think that's because there's nothing here,

709
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,630
还是他在保护她呢
or because he's protecting her.

710
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,930
他就是不知道
There's nothing there.

711
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,540
我可以再找一个别的议员
I can go to another congressman --

712
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,580
不行
No, no, no.

713
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,590
必须是个曝光率高的人
It has to be somebody high-profile,

714
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,220
领导层的人  才能引起轰动
someone in the leadership who will make waves.

715
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,280
那我再找找博奇
Let me get back to Birch.

716
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,510
太明显了
Too obvious,

717
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,590
既然他摆明了不会对弗兰克手软
now that he's shown no sympathy for Frank.

718
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,690
算盘不能打得太响
This can't look orchestrated.

719
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,870
多线作战  雷米
Multiple fronts, Remy.

720
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,690
必须得是杰姬·夏普
Has to be Jackie Sharp.

721
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,980
麦克
Mack?

722
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,030
把头发弄完吧
Let's finish up here.

723
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,230
我得回去干活儿了
I gotta get back to work.

724
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,200
没问题  老板
You got it, boss.

725
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,840
你也得去干活儿了
You need to get back to work, too.

726
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,120
我们说的事
And what we discussed?

727
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,170
 把它们办成
Make it happen.

728
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,970
你之前否认你是去私下接触的人
You denied being a back channel.

729
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,170
我没否认
I did not deny.

730
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,250
我没有证实  因为这是机密信息
I chose not to confirm because it was classified.

731
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,830
但是你的办公室一直否认
But your office has consistently denied --

732
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,010
我让道格那么做的
I instructed Doug to do so,

733
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,060
还有我的新闻部
along with my communications department.

734
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,930
私下接触如果公之于众
When a back channel becomes public,

735
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,250
也就没什么用了
it defeats its purpose.

736
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,620
精心编造的谎言
An orchestrated deception --

737
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,950
如果我们不予置评
If we had refused to comment,

738
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,510
人们就会知道确有其事
it would have suggested that it was true,

739
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,110
就会危及这一渠道
which would have endangered the process.

740
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,270
我实在没办法
I really had no choice.

741
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,970
冯先生目前在迪拜
Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.

742
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,520
我知道
I know.

743
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,650
他因腐败指控畏罪潜逃
He's fleeing corruption charges.

744
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,650
这不是他第一次被指控了
Not the first time he's been accused.

745
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,840
你的问题是什么呢
And your question?

746
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,680
我知道是他洗钱  副总统先生
I know he laundered the money, Mr. Vice President.

747
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,800
我找到确凿证据
It's just a matter of time

748
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,390
只是迟早的事
before I have the proof to substantiate that.

749
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,710
而我的问题就是  我再问一遍
So my question, which I am asking again,

750
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,000
你当时是否知情
is whether you knew.

751
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,670
那我就再回答一遍
And I will repeat my answer.

752
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,920
我当时并不知情
I did not.

753
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,180
我当时的确觉得有点不对劲
I did sense that something was awry,

754
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,140
道格知道我的担忧
and Doug was aware of my concerns.

755
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,110
我觉得调查清楚是我的责任
And I took it upon myself to find out.

756
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,800
副总统并不知情
The vice president didn't know.

757
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,950
你不知道他去赌场的事吗
You had no knowledge he was going to the casino?

758
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,410
不知道  但这并不代表
None. But that doesn't mean

759
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,550
我不对我手下的行为负责
I don't take full responsibility for my staff's behavior.

760
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,650
我责无旁贷
The buck stops with me.

761
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,900
那你发现了什么
And what did you find?

762
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,500
什么都没发现  没有非法行为
Nothing. No illegal activity.

763
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,130
我不像你那么神通广大
I don't have the same resources that you do.

764
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,640
如果你有所怀疑
If you suspected,

765
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,920
为什么不立即联络国家印第安人博彩委员会
why didn't you go immediately to the NIGC,

766
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,240
印第安人事务局  或者...
the BIA, the Department --

767
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,220
你得理解
You have to understand.

768
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,190
我们中期选举很吃力
We're facing very difficult midterms.

769
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,290
我不想为一些
I didn't want to bring attention

770
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,160
没有实据的判断而引发关注
to a series of allegations that may have no basis in fact.

771
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,970
或许这逻辑不是很合理
Now, that may have been misguided logic,

772
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,850
但这是我当时的选择
but that's how I chose to act.

773
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,710
错误全在我一个人头上
The mistake is mine and mine alone.

774
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,380
跟道格没关系
Not Doug's.

775
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,780
当然更算不到总统头上
And certainly not the president's.

776
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,640
我要是说我觉得
It shouldn't surprise you

777
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,030
我没看到事情的全部  你不会意外吧
if I say it feels like I am not getting the full picture.

778
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,600
所以我打算把全部展示给你
Which is why I'm prepared to give you the full picture.

779
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,650
奥利弗
Oliver?

780
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,320
白宫相信透明度
The White House believes in transparency.

781
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,550
副总统全部个人出行记录
All of the vice president's personal travel logs.

782
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,230
还包括我十年党鞭任期内的记录
And the last 10 years since I became whip.

783
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,670
和总统就职后的所有记录
As well as the president's since inauguration.

784
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,300
我们会面的对象和时间都没有任何问题
There should be no doubt as to whom we met with and when.

785
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,040
我很怀疑里面的内容
I am skeptical about what this contains.

786
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,490
这点我们也预料到了
Which is what we anticipated

787
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,730
所以奥利弗会全程在场
and why Oliver will walk you through anything

788
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,880
陪你审查全部材料
you might need to know.

789
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,030
全都在那儿了
It's all there.

790
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,940
但如果你还有其他疑问或要求
But if you have any questions or requests,

791
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,700
我们也愿意倾力协助
we'll be happy to facilitate.

792
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,820
刚开始我很紧张
I mean, at first I was really nervous.

793
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,140
但我一进入状态
But then as soon as I started getting into it,

794
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,690
开始吐露心声
starting speaking from my heart,

795
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,280
一切都自然脱口而出
all these things poured out.

796
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,720
那些我一度想说的
Everything I wanted to say.

797
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,400
我一直想说的都说出来了
That I've been wanting to say.

798
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,940
赛斯告诉我马特很满意
Seth told me that Matt was very impressed.

799
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,930
我还想做更多
I want to do more.

800
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,000
做更多采访
More interviews?

801
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,700
报刊采访  上电视
Articles. TV.

802
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,640
不论什么都可以
Whatever it takes.

803
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,690
我想帮忙
I want to help.

804
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,960
这很好  梅根
That's great, Megan.

805
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,090
谢谢你给我这个机会
Thank you for making me do this.

806
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,620
这对我来说是迈了一大步
It was a big step for me.

807
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,480
你还要赶飞机
You have a plane to catch.

808
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,840
如果你需要我做别的采访  我可以留下
I can stay longer, if you need me to do another.

809
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,370
不如你先回芝加哥
Why don't you head back to Chicago,

810
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,350
等我们制定好计划
and as soon as we put a plan together

811
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,850
再给你打电话
we can give you a buzz?

812
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,220
我能喝杯水吗
Can I get a glass of water?

813
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,010
自来水  还是瓶装的
Tap is fine, or you want bottled --

814
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,010
我自己来
I can get it.

815
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,100
汉纳希女士的车准备好了  夫人
We've got Ms. Hennessey's car ready, ma'am.

816
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:26,950
艾德华
Edward?

817
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,060
你去机场接她时
Did she seem all right

818
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,720
她看起来还好吗
when you picked her up from the airport?

819
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,420
您的意思是
How do you mean?

820
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,650
我不确定  正常吗
I don't know. Normal.

821
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,990
是的  可以这么说
Yes. I'd say so.

822
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,680
她情绪起伏很大
She's very up and down.

823
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,200
反复无常  容易激动
Very skittish and manic.

824
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,700
她确实有点紧张
I guess she did seem nervous.

825
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,000
我们没怎么交流
We didn't talk much.

826
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,500
我去看看她
I'll get her.

827
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,180
我在外面等
I'll be outside.

828
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,490
梅根
Megan?

829
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,100
我自己来
I've got it.

830
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,580
真的
Really.

831
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,730
我没事
I'm okay.

832
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,740
车在外面等着了
The car is ready whenever you are.

833
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,720
谢谢你
Thank you for everything.

834
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,750
一路顺风  保持联系
Have a safe flight. I'll be in touch.

835
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,670
我与邓巴女士的谈话卓有成效
I just had a very productive interview with Ms. Dunbar.

836
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,350
发新闻稿
Send out the press release.

837
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,230
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

838
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,670
您还好吗  夫人
You okay, ma'am?

839
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,480
我没事  我只是打碎了
Oh, I'm fine. I just dropped...

840
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,270
请让我来
Please, let me.

841
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,820
没关系  我可以的
Oh, uh, it's fine. I'm fine.

842
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,020
不  我来  您光着脚
No, I've got it. You're barefoot.

843
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,830
艾德华  真的  没事的
Edward, you don't have to. Really.

844
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
天啊  怎么了
Oh, no. What happened?

845
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,190
该死
Damn it.

846
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,960
我去找绷带
Let me get some bandages.

847
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,360
不用了
You don't have to.

848
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,790
我坚持  别动
No, I want to. Stay here.

849
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,920
目前的报导都是正面的
The coverage has been mostly positive so far.

850
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,310
邓巴那边呢
Dunbar's office?

851
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,970
他们只说很期待对记录的审核
All they've said is they look forward to reviewing the logs.

852
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,130
有人提到道格吗
Any heat on Doug?

853
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,270
有一些
Some.

854
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,350
很多人要求我发表评论
I'm getting a lot of requests for comments.

855
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,820
那是我的个人行动
I acted on my own.

856
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,330
我会全力配合司法部
And I will fully cooperate with the Justice Department.

857
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,740
可以这么对外说吗
We can put that out?

858
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,390
先生
Sir?

859
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,590
这或许会吸引更多注意
It might generate more interest.

860
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,030
注意我  而不是副总统
On me. Not the vice president.

861
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,730
无论什么情况我都能应付好
I can handle whatever comes my way.

862
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,940
就这么说
Put it out.

863
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,870
我去把最新的剪报都打出来  先生
I'll print you out the most recent clips, too, sir.

864
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,860
要想办法向邓巴透露风声吗
Should I find a way to tip off Dunbar?

865
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,930
还是顺其自然吧
Let nature take its course.

866
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,560
我们刚找到雷米
We got a hold of Remy.

867
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,540
他刚回来了
He just got back to town.

868
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,390
他在哪
Where is he?

869
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,130
我跟你的安保队都安排好了
I've arranged everything with your detail.

870
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,360
你做得很好  道格
You've done good work, Doug.

871
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,590
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

872
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,910
好了  这样好多了
There. That's much better.

873
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,160
谢谢  夫人
Thanks, ma'am.

874
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,940
我得走了
I'm gonna get going.

875
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,490
抱歉我有点喝醉了
I'm sorry I'm a little drunk.

876
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,180
这里是您家  您可以随心所欲
It's your house. You do whatever you want.

877
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,500
你也该喝一杯酒
You should have a glass of wine.

878
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,050
谢谢  夫人  但是...
I appreciate that, ma'am, but --

879
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,780
你已经下班了  对吗
You're off your shift, right?

880
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,160
是的  没错
I am. That's true.

881
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,330
那就不许说不喝
Then I won't take no for an answer.

882
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,690
您不该把好东西浪费在我身上
Uh, you shouldn't waste any of your good stuff on me.

883
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,250
我其实根本不懂品酒
I don't really know anything about wine.

884
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,390
那喝点波本威士忌怎么样
Then how about bourbon?

885
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,300
你肯定想喝一点
I bet you like a little of that.

886
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,230
我当然不介意能喝点波本威士忌
I definitely don't mind a bourbon from time to time.

887
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,450
那就喝波本威士忌
Then bourbon it is.

888
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,280
你现在很难找啊
You're a tough man to track down these days.

889
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,490
你拿到手表了
You got the watch.

890
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,640
变则善
"To improve is to change."

891
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,670
常变则至善
"To perfect is to change often."

892
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,520
那你想要什么样的变化呢
What sort of change are you looking for?

893
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,070
让我有选择余地的变化
Whichever leaves me options.

894
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,020
在格兰顿-希尔遇到麻烦了
Trouble at Glendon Hill?

895
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,290
带薪休假  直到调查结束
Paid leave till the investigation is over.

896
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,640
至少是带薪的
Well, at least you're being paid.

897
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,010
这是终止我合伙人身份的第一步
First step in terminating my partnership.

898
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,270
这种事你也懂
You know how things go.

899
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,960
无论发生什么
No matter what happens,

900
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,640
这都是我洗不掉的污点
there's a stain I can't wash out.

901
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,060
那么你在寻找就业机会喽
So you're looking for career opportunities.

902
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,480
我并不是要把自己整个卖给你
I'm not offering myself to you wholesale.

903
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,770
我会继续跟你斗  但是力度会小一点
I keep fighting you, but I can fight you less.

904
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,420
你说"小一点"的意思是...
And by "less" you mean...

905
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,080
让你痛  但不会让你完蛋
Enough to hurt, but not finish you.

906
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,490
作为回报  我在格兰顿-希尔之外也有前途
And in return I have a future beyond Glendon Hill,

907
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,680
不管是什么样的前途
whatever that might look like.

908
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,140
那么你是要保持中立
So you offer neutrality,

909
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,930
但最终会追随胜利者
but you'll go with the victor.

910
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,010
我想看着更厉害的人获胜
I figure let the best man win.

911
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,370
如果你失败了
And if you go down,

912
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,770
不会是因为我
it won't be because of me.

913
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,910
这已经挺够意思了
That's worth something.

914
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,660
你这是为什么
Where is this coming from?

915
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,390
保险  没别的
Insurance. That's all.

916
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,330
这跟杰姬有关吗
Does it have anything to do with Jackie?

917
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,470
已经结束了
That's over.

918
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,180
我知道你已经收服了博奇
I know you've got Birch in your pocket.

919
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,560
你不会选择乌麦克  我们太亲密了
Womack's not an option. We're too close.

920
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,370
但是杰奎琳
But Jacqueline...

921
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,090
这单纯是关于我的前途
This is about my future, pure and simple.

922
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,350
跟她没关系
She's not a part of it.

923
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,310
留着这块表吧  就当做诚意的象征
Keep the watch, as a token of good faith.

924
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,140
他虽然否认  但他在保护她
He might deny it, but he's protecting her.

925
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,940
他没有意识到的是
What he doesn't realize is

926
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,230
我比雷蒙德更不在乎杰姬
I have even less regard for Jackie than Raymond does.

927
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,350
可怜的雷米
Poor Remy.

928
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,140
感情用事
The heart can choke the mind

929
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,870
理智就会受到影响
when all its blood flows back unto itself.

930
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,120
他说"我不喜欢深色头发的女孩"
He said, "I don't like brunettes."

931
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,040
看来我差点错过了派对
Looks like I almost missed the party.

932
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,260
我已经下班了  先生
I'm off the clock, sir.

933
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,110
别紧张  弗兰西斯  我打破了一个杯子
Oh, relax. Francis, I broke a glass,

934
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:55,750
艾德华被一块碎片割伤了手
and Edward cut his hand on a piece of it.

935
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,450
天呐
Jesus.

936
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,440
我得给你换绷带了
I have to change that.

937
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,200
把那个解下来  我去拿新的...
Take that off, and I'll get fresh...

938
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,580
我希望您不要介意  先生
I hope you don't mind, sir.

939
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,200
我下了班...
I was off-duty --

940
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,870
她是不是...
Is she, uh...

941
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,810
喝醉了吗  有一点
Drunk? A little.

942
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,050
你喝了多少这东西
How many of these have you had?

943
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,540
喝了一点
A few.

944
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,400
不止一点吧
More than a few.

945
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,030
我可以用你的杯子吗
May I?

946
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,400
用吧
Please.

947
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,460
让我看看
Let me see.

948
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,680
没什么事
Oh, it's not too bad.

949
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,750
流了很多血
There's a lot of blood.

950
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,250
没有看上去那么糟
Looks worse than it is.

951
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,890
痛吗
Is it painful?

952
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,440
喝了酒不那么痛了
The bourbon helps.

953
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,690
如果痛你就说
Now you let me know if this hurts.

954
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,840
一点都不痛  先生
Not one bit, sir.

955
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:50,520
你头痛吗
How's your head?

956
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,500
没事
Fine.

957
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,900
睡前吃了几片阿司匹林
Took a few aspirin before I went to sleep.

958
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,210
你呢
You?

959
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,660
我睡得可香了
I slept like a baby.

960
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,190
很好  你需要好好睡一觉
Good. You needed that.

961
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,040
怎么了
What is it?

962
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,070
很奇怪
Something weird.

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}当美国政府爆出丑闻  需要进行彻底调查时
为了避免司法部的调查偏向现政府
国会会要求司法部任命特别检察官  进行全权独立的调查
特别检察官的人选必须是不担任政府公职的人员
美国历史上最著名的特别检察官
当属哈佛大学法学教授阿奇伯德·考克斯
1973年5月  考克斯被任命为负责调查水门事件的特别检察官
在调查过程中发现总统尼克松有违法嫌疑
尼克松遂命令司法部长解除考克斯的职务
但是当时连续两名司法部长都拒绝了总统的要求
并辞职抗议  考克斯最终还是被尼克松政府解职
但是他仍然被认为在水门事件中发挥了非常重要的影响

持有绿卡者也可以参加政治选举活动进行助选
但除此之外  外国公民  包括在美国持有合法签证者
都不能进行政治捐赠
最高法院对超级政治行动委员会做出裁定后
由于一些对超级政治行动委员会的捐款难以确定来源
一些政治组织也不对外公布捐助者的身份
所以在2012年美国总统大选中  很多媒体质疑
会不会有外国政治献金通过超级政治行动委员会
对特定候选人进行捐款  但是目前看  在大型的选举中
尚没有发现有确定的大额外国捐款者
本剧中的情节在现实中出现的可能性不大
2012年1月  美国最高法院在一项判决中
重新确认了不允许外国资金资助选举的禁令
