52
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,070
-她不是个忠诚的人  -的确不是

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,750
我看她不会忠于任何人
I don't think she's loyal to anyone.

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,450
-也许除了她丈夫吧  -也许吧  也难说
- Except maybe her husband. - Maybe... maybe not.

55
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,180
你什么意思
What do you mean?

56
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,000
我也不确定  但是

没有  她只是不肯走
No. She just wouldn't leave.

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,990
我又不想报警
It's not like I wanted to call the cops.

61
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,910
她也不是坏人
She's not a bad person.

62
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,210
当然不是...
No, no, but...

63
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,960
我试着和她谈  但她又开始抽了
I tried to talk to her. Then she lit up a pipe.

64
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,650
-冰毒  -是的
- Meth? - Yeah.

65
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,180
我们做室友时整天吸那个
When we were roommates that's all it was.

66
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,560
我曾经难以自拔
I used to be really deep into that.

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,890
还有海洛因
Heroin, too.

68
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,940
直到我加入了团契
And then I found the fellowship.

69
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,040
我能帮你什么
What can I do?

70
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,330
很抱歉  我不该
I'm sorry. I shouldn't --

71
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,600
不  我很高兴你来找我
No, I'm glad you came here.

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,850
我知道你上班要迟到了
I know you're late for work.

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,850
那我就请病假
I'll call in sick.

74
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,190
别这样  我没事  我这就走
Don't do that. It's fine. I'll go.

75
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,370
别走
Stay here.

76
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,000
我是说  别回去
I mean, don't go back there.

77
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,450
这样行吗
Are you sure?

78
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,170
给你钥匙  方便你进出
Keys. In case you need to come and go.

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
我大约七点半回来
I'll be back around 7:30.

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,460
谢谢你
Thank you.

81
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,900
你用不着谢我
You don't have to thank me.

82
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,360
现在只要总统一个电话
All the President has to do is pick up the phone,

83
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,550
大桥就能批下来了
and the bridge is approved.

84
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,510
如果总统想参与这事
If the President had wanted to be involved,

85
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,330
他早就打电话了
he would have already made that call.

86
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,200
本来就是他的提议  琳达
It's his initiative, Linda.

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,380
曾经是  但现在贸易战已经打响了
Was his initiative. We're in a trade war now.

88
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,170
那也用不着把好端端的政策全丢掉
But that doesn't mean we have to abandon good policy.

89
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,860
这会与他现在的立场不一致
It's inconsistent with his current stance.

90
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,890
外资投资管理委员会有30天的时间批准开建
The Committee on Foreign Investment has 30 days to approve.

91
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,060
但现在只剩六天了
There's only six days left.

92
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,840
没有美国总统的直接指示
They won't act without a directive from the

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,990
他们不会批准的
President of the United States.

94
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,520
我不明白  你一直坚定支持对中国
I'm confused, you've been the biggest proponent

95
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,350
采取强硬态度
of a strong position against China.

96
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,480
这话可不对
That is not true.

97
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,420
我早先的建议与此相反
I advocated the opposite early on.

98
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,210
你似乎很在乎这座桥
You seem fixated on this bridge.

99
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,620
还有别的原因吗
Is something else going on here?

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,100
失业率达到9.2%
Unemployment is at nine-point-two,

101
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,260
通货膨胀率飙升
inflation is skyrocketing,

102
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,400
我们马上就要丢掉多数席位了
we're on the verge of losing our majority.

103
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,770
总统需要一则好消息向世人公布
The president needs to offer a piece of good news.

104
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,970
一座桥  简直是微不足道
A bridge? That's a drop in the bucket.

105
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,400
工作  基础设施
Jobs, infrastructure,

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
削减赤字
deficit reduction--

107
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,540
你还是没说实话
You're still not being straight with me.

108
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,090
我没别的用心
I have no ulterior motive here,

109
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,150
可如果你非要这么想
but if you feel that strongly

110
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,610
总统也非要这么想的话
and the president feels that strongly,

111
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,960
那我就不管了
then I'll back off.

112
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,570
不会再提了
I won't mention it again.

113
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,590
这是个明智的决定
I think that's a wise decision.

114
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,040
我们该团结起来
We should be a united front.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,330
非常赞同
I couldn't agree more.

116
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,410
谢谢
Thank you.

117
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,840
为什么凡事都这么不容易
Why does everything have to be a struggle?

118
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,450
就没人能说一次"好"吗
Can't some people just say "Yes" for once?

119
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,230
先生
Sir.

120
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,960
我要总统明后天的日程表
I need the president's schedule for the next two days.

121
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
她改变主意了吗
She change her mind?

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,150
你觉得呢
What do you think?

123
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,500
我们下一步做什么
So what's our next move?

124
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,530
我去办桥的事
I'll focus on the bridge,

125
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,850
你去跟印第安人事务部谈
you talk to the Indian affairs.

126
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,580
怀特豪尔的部落越早得到认证
The sooner that Whitehall's tribe gets recognized,

127
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,750
赌场就能越早动工
the sooner they can break ground on that casino.

128
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,840
是  先生
Yes sir.

129
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,410
也许这对我有帮助
Maybe it will help me, you know?

130
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,030
多公开谈谈那事
If I talk about it more in the open.

131
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,740
就像在你的访谈上那样
I mean that's what your interview did.

132
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,210
我打进电话  公开说出那些事
When I called. When I could say those things out loud.

133
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,170
我们不想让你觉得你有义务如此
Well, we don't want you to feel obligated.

134
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,520
我知道媒体还一直缠着你
I know the press hasn't left you alone.

135
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,760
如果他们还要继续给我拍照
If they're going to keep taking pictures of me,

136
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
我至少该说点什么
I should at least say something.

137
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,610
麦金尼斯上军事法庭指日可待
Well, that's only going to become more intense

138
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,870
事态会越来越紧张
when McGinnis gets closer to his court-marshal.

139
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,000
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

140
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,450
我准备好了
I'm prepared.

141
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,730
如果你能去跟军事委员会谈谈
If you come and speak to the Armed Services Committee,

142
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,210
说出你的往事
tell your story,

143
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,390
那么法案一定能进入投票阶段
I feel confident we can get it to a vote.

144
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,070
这样的重磅新闻他们不能无视
I'd be too much coverage to ignore it.

145
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,990
你觉得法案会通过吗
And you think it will pass?

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
要先通过委员会
We need to get it through committee first.

147
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,660
但我要说明  梅根
But let's be clear, Megan,

148
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,390
你不光要举证
it's not just the testimony.

149
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,610
稍后你还得面对媒体
We'll need you to do a media avail after.

150
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,700
拍照片  做声明
Photo ops, a statement.

151
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,360
-好的  -你不是一个人
- Ok. - You won't be alone.

152
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,470
我会一直支持你
I'll be standing right next to you.

153
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,680
还有我
And so will I.

154
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,550
好的
Ok.

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,800
你觉得这样做对吗
Do you think we're doing the right thing?

156
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,990
把她拉到镜头前
Hauling her in front of the cameras?

157
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,920
她说她想这样做  我们得相信她
We have to trust her when she says she wants to.

158
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,280
但重要的是
But it's very important

159
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,350
不仅是你  白宫也支持我们
that the White House backs us up on this, not just you.

160
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,780
我不确定加勒特会不会公开表示支持
I'm not sure if Garrett will get involved publicly.

161
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,210
你能和他谈谈吗
Well, can you talk to him?

162
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,830
我们最近没怎么交谈
We haven't been doing much talking about anything lately.

163
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,880
情况还没好转吗
Things haven't gotten any better?

164
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,490
我们差不多一个礼拜没说过话了
We haven't said a word to each other in almost a week.

165
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,950
我也经历过  真可怕
I've been there, it's awful.

166
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,670
和弗兰克吗
With Frank?

167
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,730
当然
Sure.

168
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,770
你们是怎么做的
What did you do?

169
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,210
我们找了一个人
We saw someone.

170
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,670
你是指心理咨询师吗
You mean a therapist?

171
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,750
不担心被曝光吗
Weren't you worried about exposure?

172
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,760
他是个牧师
He was a minister.

173
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,330
严格说  他不是心理咨询师
He wasn't exactly a therapist.

174
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,630
更像是精神指引那种的
It was more like a spiritual guidance, type thing.

175
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,970
唯一的区别是他有学位
The only difference was that he had a degree.

176
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,730
我可以帮你联系
I could put you in touch.

177
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,890
太冒险了
It's too risky.

178
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,770
只是个建议而已
Just a suggestion.

179
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,290
你要是改变主意就告诉我
Let me know if you change your mind.

180
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,220
谢谢
Thanks.

181
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,950
那么你能试着和加勒特谈谈吗
In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?

182
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,550
我们非常需要他的支持
We really need his support with this.

183
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,790
我会的
I will.

184
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,180
什么事
Yes?

185
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,390
请带他进来
Show him in, please.

186
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,810
雷米
Remy.

187
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,470
这么正式
So formal.

188
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,380
请坐吧
Would you have a seat?

189
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,730
你不该让实习生工作到这么晚
Shouldn't keep your interns so late.

190
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,400
我们也许没有个人生活  但他们有
You and I might not have lives, but they do.

191
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,960
有工作没做完就要继续做  这他们懂
When there's work to be done, we work. They know that.

192
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,240
为什么晚上10点叫我过来
Why am I here at 10 at night?

193
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,970
共和党的钱从哪来的
Where is the GOP getting their money?

194
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,210
你是问那两千五百万吧
That is a $25 million question, isn't it?

195
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,370
你一定知道
You must have an idea.

196
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,600
你为什么会那么认为
What makes you think that?

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,050
因为你无所不知
Because you know things.

198
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,790
所以格兰顿-希尔升你做合伙人
That's why Glendon Hill made you partner.

199
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,810
我们大部分客户都是民主党人
Most of our clients are Democrats.

200
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,710
我和你一样毫不知情
I'm just as much in the dark as you are.

201
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,370
我要失去我的选区了  雷米
I'm losing in my district, Remy.

202
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,750
真希望我能帮你
And I wish I could help you.

203
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,300
就算我赢得选举  也无所谓了
Even if I pull off a win, it doesn't matter.

204
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,480
共和党占据众议院多数席位
The GOP takes the House,

205
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,740
我会被踢出领导层
I lose my spot in the leadership,

206
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,400
失去职务  失去我为之努力的一切
this office, everything I've worked for.

207
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,980
我替你难过
I feel for you.

208
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,550
但你想要的是我不知道的信息
But you want information I don't have.

209
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,750
我们上次的见面
Are you upset

210
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,540
让你不高兴了吗
about the last time we saw each other?

211
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,110
完全没有
Not at all.

212
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,970
我说的很清楚
I made myself clear.

213
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,420
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk?

214
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,890
不谈工作  不谈政治
No work, no politics.

215
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,630
你想谈什么都可以
We can talk about whatever you want.

216
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,830
我跟人约会  从未超过六个月
I've never... been with anyone for more than six months.

217
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,540
我在军队的时候  总是四处奔波
When I was in the army I was always on the move and, um...

218
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,740
进入国会之后
Since I've been in Congress,

219
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,730
又实在没有时间
I just haven't had time.

220
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,480
我不是要你嫁给我
I wasn't asking to marry you.

221
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,670
只是想比一夜情更认真一些
Just to be more than company for a night.

222
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,530
你依然那么想吗
Do you still want that?

223
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,030
我来了  不是吗
I'm here, aren't I?

224
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,250
那我们必须划定一个界限
There would have to be clear boundaries.

225
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,120
我们私底下的事
Whatever we have privately

226
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,280
不能影响我们的公事关系
couldn't affect our professional relationship.

227
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,570
那我们就不该在你的办公室谈这些
Then we shouldn't be having this conversation in your office.

228
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,520
很高兴我们能把话说开
I'm glad we had this meeting.

229
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,530
如果你还想见我  给我打电话
If you'd like to have another, just call me.

230
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,130
我们可以省掉秘书这一关
We can leave the secretaries out of it.

231
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,330
我会再看看  让琳达联系你们
I'll review this and have Linda get in touch.

232
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,810
-谢谢  先生  -谢谢  先生
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

233
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,720
早上好  总统先生
Good morning, Mr. President.

234
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,800
你好  弗兰克
Hi, Frank.

235
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,460
我把波本威士忌放在家里了
I left my bourbon at home,

236
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,280
但您有时间喝个咖啡吗
but you have time for some coffee?

237
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,780
我不用  你自便
I'm fine, you go ahead.

238
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,690
我想跟您谈谈杰斐逊港大桥
I wanted to talk to you about the Port Jefferson Bridge.

239
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,380
琳达说你们俩谈过了
Linda told me you two spoke.

240
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,620
您重新考虑过吗
Have you reconsidered?

241
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,700
现在时机不对  弗兰克
It's not the right time, Frank.

242
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,670
等到紧张局势过去后
We'll find some other project

243
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,430
我们再找别的项目展示我们的计划
to showcase our program once tensions subside.

244
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,340
在竞选中
During the campaign,

245
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,590
您反复承诺会重视重要的基建
you repeatedly promised to address critical infrastructure.

246
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,750
我们已经进入了您任期的第二个年头
We're well into your second year.

247
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,350
这个项目已经蓄势待发
This project is ready to go,

248
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,100
您也不想再重头搞一个吧
you don't want to have to start from square one.

249
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,830
我在考虑中期选举的事
I'm thinking midterms.

250
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,920
我们得表现出一致性
We have to project consistency.

251
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,480
但人们不会为了一致性投票
Except people don't vote for consistency,

252
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,910
他们只为确实的进展投票
they vote for concrete progress.

253
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,610
琳达说你似乎对这座桥很执迷
Linda mentioned that you seemed obsessed with this bridge.

254
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,620
我现在觉得她说对了
I'm beginning to think she was right.

255
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,680
那个背后捅刀的恶心婊子
The backstabbing, vomit-inducing bitch.

256
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,970
她说对了吗  弗兰克
Is she right, Frank?

257
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,290
跟我说说你为什么这么在乎这座桥
Tell me why this bridge is so important to you.

258
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,690
我不想把您卷进来
I wanted to insulate you from this--

259
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,830
什么意思
From what?

260
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,490
您让我与中国人私下接触
You asked me to back channel with the Chinese

261
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,880
我就继续那么做了
and I have continued to do so.

262
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,560
不  我让你停止跟中国人私下接触
No, I told you to stop back channeling

263
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,620
而你还是那么做了吗
and you did anyway?

264
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,840
还不告诉我  弗兰克
Without informing me, Frank--

265
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,430
我得拉开您的距离
I needed to distance you.

266
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,280
有些事是不能让总统知道的
There are issues that a president cannot be aware of.

267
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,820
什么事
What issues--

268
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,870
但我能告诉您的是
But, what I can tell you...

269
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,870
大桥的建设
...is that the building of this bridge

270
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,400
可以直接影响我们在中期选举中
directly affects our ability to combat the Republicans

271
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,490
与共和党的对抗
in the midterms.

272
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,150
中国人是不是...
Have the Chinese--

273
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,970
总统先生  您正在问
Mr. President, you are asking questions

274
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,310
您不想知道答案的问题
you do not want the answers to.

275
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,560
我们的风险有多大  弗兰克
All right, how much danger are we in, Frank?

276
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,190
如果我们现在就结束谈话  就没有风险
None if we end this conversation right now.

277
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,540
有时候我觉得
Sometimes I feel like

278
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,090
我已经无法控制我自己的政府了
I'm losing control over my goddamn administration.

279
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,220
您承受着很大压力  先生
You're under pressure, sir,

280
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,940
但您并没有失控
but you're not losing control.

281
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,340
有很多人在帮您
You have people who are looking out for you:

282
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,340
我  琳达  您妻子
me, Linda, your wife.

283
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,090
我对她也快失去控制了
I might be losing control of her too.

284
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,110
我不该这么说
I shouldn't have said that...

285
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,350
当然她也是为我着想
Of course she wants the best for me.

286
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,860
克莱尔说了什么吗
Has Claire said anything?

287
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,560
我知道她们有聊天
I know they talk.

288
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,860
不多
Not much...

289
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,310
只是说你们之间有点磕磕绊绊
just that things have been a little rocky.

290
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,460
那真是说得太轻了
Well, that's an understatement.

291
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,500
您的工作是世界上最难做的
You have the most difficult job on earth.

292
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,370
换了谁婚姻上都会出现问题
It would take a toll on any marriage.

293
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,170
所以我劝您
Which is why I'm urging you

294
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,660
重新考虑一下桥的事
to reconsider your decision on the bridge.

295
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,290
我这话不是以副总统的身份
And I'd say that not as your vice president...

296
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,320
而是以你朋友的身份
but as your friend.

297
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,710
因为我在乎你
Because I care about you.

298
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,930
好吧  我会再看看
All right, I'll... I'll have another look at it.

299
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,420
谢谢您  总...
Thank you, Mr--

300
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,170
谢谢你  加勒特
Thank you, Garrett.

301
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,170
弗罗斯特先生
Mr. Frost.

302
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,540
早
Morning.

303
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,860
我们2006年就提交了所有文件
We filed all our paperwork back in 2006.

304
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,000
事无巨细  该做得都做了
We dotted all of our I's and crossed all of our T's.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,990
我们有超过317份申请
There's over 317 applications.

306
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,470
每一份申请最少需要一年去评估
Each one requires at least a year to review.

307
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,840
-你需要多雇些调查员  -不只是人事的问题
- You need more researchers. - It's not just personnel.

308
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,620
还要考虑出行  归档  行政工作
There's travel, filing, administration...

309
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,830
你出个价吧
Name the figure.

310
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,320
一千二  三百万
Twelve, thirteen million.

311
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,170
这需要国会的拨款
That requires an appropriation from Congress.

312
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,970
副总统会搞定的
The vice president can make that happen.

313
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,020
但首先你得认证尤干亚部落
But first we need you to recognize the Ugaya tribe.

314
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,170
我们规定  要分先来后到
Our policy is first come, first serve.

315
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,180
还有别的申请我们
There are other applications which we--

316
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,170
丹尼尔·拉尼根把我们踢出部落了
Daniel Lanagin disenrolled us.

317
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,370
我们失去了印第安人事务局的福利
We lost our right to BIA benefits.

318
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,690
你不单只是要开赌场吧
Is this more about starting a casino?

319
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,420
是为了讨回公道
It's about correcting an injustice.

320
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,720
我不能牵扯到部落纠纷中
I can't be getting involved in inner-tribal conflicts.

321
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,830
你可以
Yes, you can.

322
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,870
如果你想要那笔拨款
If you want that appropriation.

323
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:32,870
两个月
Two months.

324
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,870
如果历史核查没问题  或许能更短
Maybe less if all the ancestry holds up.

325
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,260
拉尼根知道了
Lanagin knows.

326
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,180
他怎么说
And what did he say?

327
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,140
他想见面
He wants to meet.

328
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,670
但这次是去他的地盘
But on his turf this time.

329
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,710
想个法子  让我能去密苏里
I need a way to get to Missouri

330
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,690
又不引人注意
without attracting any attention.

331
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,840
乌麦克的选区在堪萨斯城
Womack's district's in Kansas City.

332
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,900
离赌场不远
It's not far from the casino.

333
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,340
看看他最近有什么活动
See if he has any events coming up.

334
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,990
集会  筹款之类的
Rallies, fundraisers.

335
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,860
克莱尔法案的联署人找得怎么样了
How's it coming with co-sponsors for Claire's bill?

336
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,360
非常好  进展很大
Terrific. We're making great progress.

337
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,590
就一篇演讲  让国会明白
One speech. It'll send a message to Congress that --

338
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,350
也让参谋长联席会议知道我要践踏他们...
And a message to the Joint Chiefs that I'm trampling on--

339
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,240
去年有两万四千起性侵事件
Twenty-four thousand assaults last year,

340
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,450
只有三千起上报
only 3,000 reported because--

341
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,390
我知道是什么情况
I know the figures.

342
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,450
你知道多少人因为创伤而自杀
Do you know how many suicides result from the trauma--

343
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,000
不是数据的问题
It's not the question of statistics.

344
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,170
这部法案能挽救生命
This bill will save lives.

345
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,500
能晚点再说吗
Can we discuss this later?

346
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,270
这次会面还是我预约的呢  加勒特
I had to schedule this meeting, Garrett.

347
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,450
现在大中午的  特莉莎
It's the middle of the day, Tricia.

348
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,430
你十分清楚
You know very well...

349
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,440
别逼我回家再游说你
Don't make me lobby you when I go home--

350
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,930
很抱歉打扰了  总统先生
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. President.

351
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,310
秘书长到了
The secretary general's here.

352
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,780
再给我两分钟
I got two more minutes.

353
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,640
现在12点30了  他约的是12点15
It's 12:30. He was scheduled for 12:15.

354
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,020
我马上走
I'll go.

355
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,490
你应该挽留我
You were supposed to tell me to stay,

356
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,290
但很高兴我至少还值两分钟
but it's nice to know I'm worth at least two minutes.

357
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,230
你好  特莉莎
Hi, Tricia.

358
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,930
不  没事的
No, please, don't worry about it.

359
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,550
那真是太糟了
Oh, that's awful.

360
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,740
好  当然
Yes, of course.

361
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,580
我去找找他的电话
Let me grab his number for you.

362
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,140
好
Right.

363
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,400
他叫托马斯·拉金医生
His name is Dr. Thomas Larkin,

364
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,350
号码是2022516258
at 202-251-6258.

365
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,600
如果你想的话  我可以提前和他联系
And if you'd like, I can give him a call beforehand

366
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,320
让他知道你要去找他
and let him know you'll be reaching out.

367
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,380
好的  有什么我能帮忙的尽管开口
Okay. Well you let me know if I can be of any help.

368
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,040
晚安  特莉莎
Good night, Tricia.

369
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,510
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

370
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,610
等着瞧吧
We'll see.

371
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,030
我的主旨是将色原说
The idea is to take color theory

372
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,980
彻底颠覆
and turn it on its head.

373
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,380
打破所有陈规
Break all the rules.

374
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,680
真是精彩
They're gorgeous.

375
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,760
你说你的客户是谁来着
Who'd you say your client is?

376
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,260
我还没说过
I didn't.

377
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,640
我只是想没准我认识他
I was just wondering if maybe I knew them.

378
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,740
你不认识
You don't.

379
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,780
暂且说他是个
Let's say he's a collector

380
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,460
四处发掘新人才的收藏家吧
always on the lookout for new talent.

381
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,920
你为亚当·嘉乐威工作  对吗
I understand you work for Adam Galloway.

382
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,950
没错
Yeah...

383
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,180
能挣些生活费
it's a way to pay the bills.

384
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,260
如果你喜欢那种风格
I mean, Adam's a good photographer

385
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,760
亚当的确是个优秀的摄影师
if you like that kind of thing.

386
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,130
我则对形态更感兴趣
I'm much more interested in form.

387
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,570
这些加起来多少钱
How much for all of them?

388
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,840
什么
What?

389
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,350
我全买了
I'd like to buy them all.

390
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,350
密苏里州的"不轻信州"外号可不是白叫的
Missouri is the Show Me State for a reason.

391
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,950
我们正要向全国人民证明
And we need to show the rest of America

392
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,400
我们的领导层坚实可靠
that we can keep our leadership intact.

393
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,820
看见满屋宾朋
It is a pleasure to look out

394
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,070
人人喜笑颜开  我很高兴
and see a room full of smiling faces.

395
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,060
这场面在华盛顿特区可不是天天都能见到
That's not something you see every day in Washington, D.C.

396
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,700
你的编辑怎么说
What did your editors say?

397
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,090
五千字
5,000 words.

398
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
起码应该翻倍啊
This should be twice that.

399
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,420
我能争取到八千字
I can probably get them to eight,

400
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,120
那样的话我还要采访第一夫人
but I'm gonna need the first lady, too.

401
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,540
单独采访
Separate interviews.

402
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,620
那我和安德伍德先生商量一下
Let me talk to Mrs. Underwood.

403
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,600
为什么是你而不是康纳来和我谈这事
How come you're coming to me with this instead of Connor?

404
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,290
你别跟别人说  他辞职了
Between you and me, he's out.

405
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,440
跳槽去太空探索技术公司了
He got a job at SpaceX.

406
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,090
他自愿的还是被人逼走的
His choice or was he pushed out?

407
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,100
一般人不喜欢和我共事  马特
People don't like working with me, Matt.

408
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,130
你大约是绝无仅有的一个
You may be the only one.

409
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,300
我也不喜欢和你打交道
I don't like you either.

410
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,980
但如果能采访到第一夫人  我或许会喜欢你
I might if you give me the First Lady.

411
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,780
她们明天要跟军事委员会面谈
They'll both be speaking to armed services tomorrow.

412
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,020
还有梅根·汉纳希
Along with Megan Hennessy.

413
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,110
她就是那个被将军...
She's the one the general--

414
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,910
没错
That's right.

415
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,170
我给你安排单独专访  短信沟通你的报道
I'll set up a one-on-one, text you for your piece.

416
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,740
好  等你消息了  老兄
All right, let me know, man.

417
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,180
乐意为《时代》效劳  伙计
Anything for the Times, man.

418
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,920
乐意为《时代》效劳  是吧
Anything for the Times, huh?

419
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,190
却把我们挡在捐助者会议大门外
Then we get shut out of donor meetings.

420
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,480
我说的是杂志  没错
The magazine. And yes.

421
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,520
雷蒙德·塔斯克
Raymond Tusk.

422
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,330
你老板去年十月去见过他
Your boss went to see him last October.

423
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,250
都记在国会的旅行报告里了
It's in his congressional travel report.

424
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,080
当时我还没来工作
Before my time.

425
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,450
你说他们俩从没见过
You said they didn't communicate.

426
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,650
我的原话是"据我了解不认识"
I said, "Not to my knowledge."

427
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,670
我们现在就在密苏里
We're in Missouri.

428
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,710
他不是捐助者之一
He's not one of the donors.

429
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,170
我能引述你的话吗
I can quote you on that?

430
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,990
别把我的名字拼错了
If you spell my name right.

431
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,500
一般来讲  我不引述北方作家的话
Now, normally, I don't quote Northern writers,

432
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,960
但有时候他们中也有人
but every now and then one of them

433
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,760
能说出挺有道理的话
says something that makes a lot of sense,

434
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,920
这位叫爱默生的老兄  你们没准听说过
and this Emerson fellow you probably heard of,

435
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,210
他曾经说  交友的唯一办法
once wrote that the only way

436
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,750
就是自己够朋友
to have a friend is to be one.

437
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,980
我想各位非常清楚
I think you all know

438
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,140
泰瑞对他的选区人民有多够朋友
what kind of a friend Terry has been to this district.

439
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,630
所以今天  我骄傲地向各位介绍他
So I am proud to introduce him today

440
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,880
并称他为我的朋友
and to call him my friend.

441
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,620
有请多数党领袖
Would you please welcome, the majority leader,

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,470
泰瑞·乌麦克议员
Representative Terry Womack.

443
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,010
谢谢你  副总统先生
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

444
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,260
都安排好了
We all set?

445
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,210
我告诉媒体
I told the press

446
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,350
你将和几位捐助者私下会面
you were having some private meetings with contributors.

447
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,090
有人质疑吗
Any protests?

448
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,790
没有  除了艾拉·萨伊德
We're good except for Ayala Sayyad.

449
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,930
-谢谢  -谢谢  她怎么了
- Thank you. - Thank you. What's going on?

450
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,430
可能是个盲点
Potential blind spot.

451
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,750
去车那边  边走边说
Tell me on the way to the car.

452
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,700
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

453
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,560
谢谢
Thank you.

454
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,570
不许乱叫
Calm down. Now.

455
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,340
欢迎
Welcome.

456
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,840
真是愉快的巧遇啊  雷蒙德
What a pleasant surprise, Raymond.

457
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,640
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

458
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,890
我以为今天要和你单独见面呢  丹尼尔
I was expecting to see you privately today, Daniel.

459
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,070
事关重大
It's a serious matter.

460
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,250
所以我把"酋长"都请来了
I invite all the chiefs to the circle.

461
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,920
泳池不错
Nice pool.

462
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,800
我没在里面游过
I've never swum in it.

463
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,910
氯水弄得我眼睛疼
The chlorine hurts my eyes.

464
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,530
想游的话  欢迎试水
You're welcome to take a dip in it if you'd like.

465
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,330
下次吧
Another time.

466
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,630
雷蒙德跟我说你喜欢吃肋排
Well, Raymond tells me you're a ribs man.

467
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,280
我这儿有三份顶级的肉
Well, I've got three of the choicest pieces of meat

468
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,210
这辈子难得一尝
you'll ever see in your life coming out.

469
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,460
你绝对不会想错过
You do not want to pass on this.

470
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,860
我不会待很久
I won't be here long.

471
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,520
言归正传  尤干亚群体
So, the Ugaya band.

472
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,450
冰山一角
Tip of the iceberg.

473
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,930
他们不是正式的部落
They're not a real tribe.

474
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,240
他们就要成为正式的了
They're about to be.

475
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,210
不  他们是一群制造麻烦的家伙
No, they're a bunch of troublemakers

476
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,850
总是报太大希望
with too much hope on their hands.

477
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,070
等他们得到认证
Once they get recognized,

478
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,230
就能建立自己的赌场
they're gonna have their own casino.

479
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,310
最快也要两年吧
In two years... at best?

480
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,430
趁着还有泳池好好享受吧
You better enjoy this pool while you can.

481
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,470
我觉得你的赌场
I don't think your casino

482
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,110
承受不住那么激烈的竞争
can stand that sort of competition.

483
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,480
你以为怀特豪尔一离开印第安人事务局
Who do you think Whitehall called

484
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,270
最先给谁打了电话
as soon as he left the BIA?

485
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,690
你承诺两年后给他们赌场
You offer them a casino two years from now,

486
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,430
而我们能给出他真正想要的
we offered what they really want.

487
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,950
回归我的部落
Reenrollment in my tribe.

488
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,780
你的冰山一角正在融化  弗兰克
A tip of your iceberg is melting, Frank.

489
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,010
而且你时间也不多了
And you do not have time on your side,

490
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,020
这样如何
so how about this...?

491
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,680
你帮我和加勒特重归于好
You help me repair my relationship with Garrett,

492
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,880
丹和我就让资金
Dan and I here get the money

493
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,050
流向正确的方向
flowing back in the right direction.

494
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,940
这样如何
How about this...?

495
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,600
我让印第安人事务局调查你们两个
I get the BIA to investigate both of you.

496
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,250
和冯的关系  洗钱
Connection to Feng, laundering--

497
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,330
你可以  但你不会
You could, but you won't.

498
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,600
你不敢
You don't dare.

499
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,860
我已经资助民主党九年了
My money has been going to the Democrats for nine years.

500
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,590
你曾是他们的党鞭
You were the whip for all of them.

501
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,860
把我们扯进来  你也自身难保
You implicate us, you implicate yourself.

502
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,820
还会殃及领导层的每个人
And everyone in the leadership.

503
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,700
牛排来了
Here comes the steak.

504
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,970
你会喜欢这个的  弗兰克
Now you are going to enjoy this, Frank.

505
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,650
给你
There you go.

506
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,020
谢谢
Thank you.

507
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,970
尝尝吧  弗兰克
Now dig in, Frank.

508
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,150
别喂苍蝇了
Before the flies get to it.

509
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,130
我不用了  谢谢
I'll pass, thanks.

510
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,330
你确定
Are you sure?

511
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,700
这可是酱烧松阪牛肉
This is soy-fed Matsusaka beef.

512
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,720
要知道  我的祖先会对这头牛祷告
You know, my ancestors would've prayed to this heifer

513
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,340
祭奠它的灵魂
to honor her spirit.

514
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,620
但是两百块一磅
But at 200 bucks a pound,

515
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,900
我想  传统还是滚边吧
I figure... fuck tradition.

516
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,100
来吧  及时行乐  弗兰克
Come on, live a little, Frank.

517
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,900
要叫副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

518
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,700
不是我的副总统
Not my Vice President.

519
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,380
你现在是在保留地的地盘上
You're on sovereign land.

520
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,760
狗可真好猜  不是吗
Dogs are so predictable, aren't they?

521
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,360
替我安排与沃克会面
Set up a meeting with Walker.

522
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,560
如果可以就今晚  我六点能到
Tonight, if possible. I should be back by six.

523
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,760
拉尼根没让步吗
Lanagin didn't budge?

524
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,380
他让尤干亚回归了  得马上把桥的事敲定
He reenrolled the Ugaya. We have to get the bridge approved now.

525
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,190
我去联系琳达
I'll call Linda.

526
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,110
绕开她  我不想让她参与会面
Bypass her, I don't want her in the meeting.

527
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,090
这就去办
I'm on it.

528
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,050
谢谢
Thanks.

529
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,030
密查姆  和飞机联系
Meechum, get in touch with the plane

530
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,180
回程航班要做肋排
have them make ribs for the flight back.

531
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,270
好的  先生
Yes sir.

532
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,580
副总统先生  有空吗
Mr. Vice President, do you have a moment?

533
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,910
对不起  总统要见我
I'm sorry, the President asked to see me.

534
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,470
不  他没有  是你要求会面
No, he didn't, you requested the meeting

535
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,020
然后我取消了
and I took it off the schedule.

536
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,110
你干了什么
You did what?

537
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,390
去你办公室聊
Let's go in your office.

538
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,370
你撒谎了  弗兰克
You lied, Frank.

539
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,470
你说桥的事你不管了
You said you would let the bridge go

540
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,480
然后就背着我捣鬼
and then you went behind my back,

541
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,300
你这会儿就想这么做
just like you're trying to do now.

542
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,040
我不需要征求你的同意
I do not require your permission.

543
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,810
不  但你应该叫上我
No, but you should involve me.

544
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,120
总统和副总统之间
The President and the Vice President

545
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,070
有问题需要私下讨论
have issues they must discuss privately.

546
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,930
你对我保密
When you are secretive,

547
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,090
我就做不好我的工作
it prevents me from being able to do my job.

548
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,180
你这样把会面取消
And when you cancel meetings,

549
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,360
也让我做不好我的工作
it prevents me from being able to do mine.

550
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,350
所以我才想聊聊
Which is why I wanted to talk,

551
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,430
这样才能解决问题
so we can work things out.

552
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,730
-我不想浪费时间  -我们应该合作
- I will not waste my time - We should be working together.

553
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,640
膨胀你的自尊心
inflating your sense of self-importance!

554
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,600
你说什么
Excuse me?

555
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,240
你赢过多少次选举
How many elections have you won?!

556
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,130
当过多少个国会委员会的主席
How many congressional committees have you chaired?!

557
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,440
如果不是我在竞选时推荐了你
Would you even be working in the White House

558
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,430
你现在会在白宫工作吗
if I hadn't recommended you during the campaign?

559
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,410
我不是一直在还你人情吗
I returned that favor and then some.

560
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,070
看看你的办公桌在哪
Look where your desk is now!

561
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,700
那我们就互不相欠了
And I'd say we're even.

562
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,650
你要还想让我尊重你
And if you want to maintain my respect,

563
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,010
你的做法大错特错
you're going about it all wrong.

564
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,390
我是想跟你解决问题
I asked you in here to work out a situation--

565
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,920
你这是强行要求
You didn't ask, you demanded!

566
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,760
我不允许自己被排除在外
I will not be left out of the loop,

567
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,490
我是总统的幕僚长
I'm the president's chief of staff.

568
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,580
你就这么当幕僚长吗
You call this being chief of staff?

569
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,900
篡改他的日程安排
Micromanaging his datebook?

570
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,280
不如说是高级排程员
I'd say that's more of a glorified scheduler.

571
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,190
要是没有我尽职尽责  白宫会无法正常运作
The White House would fall off its rails without me doing my job.

572
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,150
-你确定吗  -我确定
- Are you certain about that? - Yes, I am.

573
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,610
我时刻为总统着想
I look out for the president 24/7.

574
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,810
我让他知晓一切
I keep him informed.

575
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,490
帮他理清轻重缓急
I keep his priorities straight.

576
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,830
你当副总统前一切都好好的  弗兰克
We did just fine before you became vice president, Frank.

577
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,290
好  我们现在就去总统办公室
All right, let's go over to the Oval Office right now

578
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,550
让总统做个选择
and ask the president to choose:

579
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,040
是幕僚长还是副总统
his chief of staff or his vice president.

580
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,580
我知道他会选谁
I know what the answer would be.

581
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,610
你要一起去吗
You wanna go?

582
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,180
我猜你也不敢
I didn't think so.

583
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,330
我明早要见到总统
Now I will see the president tomorrow morning,

584
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,480
不管有没有安排
schedule or no.

585
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,770
离开前请把灯关上
And please, turn out the lights before you leave.

586
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,680
我以为你回家了
I thought you went home.

587
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,420
还没有
No, not yet.

588
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,840
您有空吗
Um, do you have a moment?

589
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,090
有什么问题吗
Is there something wrong?

590
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,940
我知道您在重新考虑建桥的事  我想
I know you are reconsidering the bridge project and I want-

591
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,980
我正在审查  我很快会决定的
I'm reviewing it. I'll make my decision soon.

592
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,170
您已经做过决定了  先生
But you already made a decision, sir.

593
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,410
我担心这事您是想多了
I'm concerned that you are overthinking this one.

594
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,500
-如果我们出尔反尔  -我没说明白吗
- If we backtrack... - Did I not make myself clear?

595
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,320
我只是想表达我的看法  先生
I'm just trying to offer my advice, sir.

596
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,100
我已经了解了
Which I've heard.

597
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,160
我也不用再听第二遍了
And which I don't need to hear again

598
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,620
不过  谢谢
but... thank you.

599
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,240
我知道副总统昨天和您谈过
I know the vice president spoke to you yesterday

600
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,380
-平心而论  -你知道我重视你的想法  琳达
- and in fairness... - You know I value your input, linda,

601
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,560
我说我已经了解了
but when I say I've heard it,

602
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,960
我就是真的了解了
you need to know I mean that.

603
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,110
我明白  先生
Of course, sir.

604
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,780
还有别的事吗
Is there anything else?

605
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,580
没了  先生
No, sir.

606
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,300
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

607
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,120
你让我失望了
You disappointed me.

608
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,420
我说了我需要时间
I told you it would take time.

609
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,590
有线索吗
Any leads?

610
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,070
我在查他当州参议员时的事
I've been going over his state senate days.

611
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,440
这没法快
It's a slow process.

612
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,840
我得彻底排查
I have to be thorough.

613
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,850
那为什么我两天找到的
So how is it that i've found more in two days

614
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,290
比你两个月查到的还多
than you have in two months?

615
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,780
什么意思
What do you mean?

616
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,460
我还得替你完成差事
I've had to do your job for you.

617
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,630
你有发现吗
You found something?

618
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,450
应该是我来问你这个问题
I'm the one who's supposed to ask that question.

619
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,680
你发现了什么
What'd you find?

620
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,860
我说不定能帮忙
Maybe I can help.

621
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,290
你在给弗兰克干活儿吗
Are you working for Frank?

622
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,990
是啊  我是他的媒体主管
Yeah, as his communications director.

623
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,090
我是问你在帮他收集情报吗
No, are you working for him?

624
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,610
拜托
Come on.

625
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
你给的钱比他能给的要多得多
He couldn't pay me a fraction of what you're offering.

626
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,210
别骗我了
Don't lie to me.

627
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,120
要是你对我的能力没信心了
Look, if you've lost confidence in my ability--

628
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,380
别他妈再唬我了
Stop fucking around.

629
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,220
你的选择是错的  赛斯
You made the wrong choice, Seth.

630
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,770
我不觉得
I don't think so.

631
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,730
你什么也不是
You're nothing.

632
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,510
就是只寄生虫
You're a parasite.

633
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,700
你一样  丹顿
So are you Danton.

634
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,720
只不过更人模狗样一点
Just in a nicer suit.

635
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,860
你知道可能是什么吗
Do you know what it might be?

636
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,000
注意打听
Well, keep your ear to the ground.

637
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,210
是赛斯
That was Seth.

638
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,590
他觉得雷米可能找到了我们的把柄
He thinks Remy may have something on us.

639
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
是什么
What?

640
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,470
他不知道
He doesn't know.

641
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,940
-你觉得可不可能是...  -不
- Do you think it could be-- - No.

642
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,920
就算有  也肯定是无关痛痒的小事
If it's anything I'm sure it's innocuous.

643
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,610
我们撑得住
Nothing we can't weather.

644
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,800
但我猜  他们是在虚张声势
But my bet is they're bluffing.

645
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,360
只不过想吓唬我们
Just to make us paranoid.

646
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,000
但他是个危险的人  不是吗  我是说雷蒙德
But he's a dangerous man, isn't he? Raymond?

647
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,440
我们也可以很危险
We can be dangerous too.

648
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,740
如果情势需要
When we need to be.

649
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,070
*主啊  情不自禁*
*Lord, I just can't*

650
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,980
*偶尔洒泪*
*keep from crying sometimes.*

651
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,900
*主啊  情不自禁*
*Lord, I just can't*

652
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,360
*偶尔洒泪*
*keep from crying sometimes.*

653
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,130
*世界充满哀伤*
*When the world's filled with sorrow*

654
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,040
*而我饱含热泪*
*and my eyes are filled with tears.*

655
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,840
*主啊  情不自禁*
*Lord, I just can't*

656
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:27,410
*偶尔洒泪*
*keep from crying sometimes.*

657
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,540
别停
Don't stop.

658
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,380
我曾经当过应召女郎
I used to be a call girl.

659
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,420
我要逃离那种生活
I had to get away from it.

660
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,100
所以才来这里
And that's why I came here.

661
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,540
关于我  你还有很多不知道
There's a lot of stuff you don't know about me.

662
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,900
如果你不想说  就什么都不用说
You don't have to say anything you don't want to.

663
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,790
你在公交车上拍我肩膀的时候
When you tapped on my shoulder on the bus,

664
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,870
我有一种感觉...
there was something...

665
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,570
你的眼睛
Your eyes.

666
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,560
-这么说真是太蠢了  -不
- That sounds really, really dumb. - No.

667
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,160
我也不知道怎么说
Um, I don't know.

668
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,990
我就是想把一切都告诉你
I felt like I wanted to tell you everything.

669
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,310
觉得我能信任你
Like, that I could trust you,

670
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,620
-尽管与你素昧平生  -你可以信任我的
- even though I didn't know you. - You can.

671
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,670
我从没信任过任何人
I never trusted anyone.

672
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,340
你爱过别人吗
Have you ever loved anyone?

673
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,110
没有
No.

674
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,340
我对这个世界没什么期望
I've never expected much from the world.

675
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,660
总觉得它很丑恶
It's ugly.

676
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,450
不是个公平的地方
It's not a fair place.

677
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,550
我对我现在拥有的很知足
I'm happy to have what I have.

678
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,460
我很高兴我拥有现在
I'm glad I have this.

679
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,690
我都想清楚了
I've thought it all out.

680
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,690
有一种方式
And there's a way to do it

681
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,660
没有曝光的风险
so we don't risk any exposure.

682
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,060
非要现在聊吗
Do we have to talk about this now?

683
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,380
我累了
I'm beat.

684
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,180
我的脑袋一团浆糊
My brain is f...

685
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,710
对  现在聊
Yes, we do.

686
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,370
因为这是我们的婚姻
Because it's our marriage.

687
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,570
如果想要捱过接下来两年
If we're going to survive the next two years...

688
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,380
或六年
or six.

689
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
就得做点什么
We need to do something.

690
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,550
我们应该互相支持
We should be each others' support system.

691
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,630
而不是互相施压
Not cause each other stress.

692
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,940
白宫的基础不是砖瓦
The foundation of this White House is not brick and mortar.

693
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,840
而是我们啊  加勒特
It's us, Garrett.

694
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,290
这对我很重要
This is important to me.

695
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,360
我希望你也能重视
And I want it to be important to you.

696
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,140
我得相信不管你在想什么办法
I have to trust that whatever you're managing,

697
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,570
不管你对我隐瞒了多少
to whatever extent you choose not to inform me,

698
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,950
既不会让我有危险
that I'm neither at risk,

699
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,660
也不会让我被动地纵容明显的违法行为
nor passively condoning something blatantly illegal.

700
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,900
所有风险都是我一人承担
Any risk solely falls on me,

701
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,640
您不知情  也不能被指责纵容
and you can't be accused of condoning what you're not aware of.

702
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,500
不知情也一样糟糕
Being not aware is just as egregious.

703
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,700
在这件事上不是
Not in this case.

704
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,360
我正在想办法避开麻烦
I'm steering the ship away from the rocks,

705
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,670
而不是迎头撞上
not toward them.

706
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,600
那我就给外资投资管理委员会打电话了
Then I'll call the committee for foreign investments.

707
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,750
您的选择很明智  先生
You're making the right decision, sir.

708
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,640
我还有个艰难的决定要做
I have another difficult decision to make.

709
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,300
琳达提交了她的辞职信
Linda submitted her resignation.

710
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,720
我很生她的气
I was furious with her.

711
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,590
这招让我很被动
That was a very manipulative move.

712
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,900
我能猜到她为什么这么做
I can speculate as to why she made it.

713
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,400
她的不满有道理吗
Are her complaints valid?

714
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,260
我对这个问题的看法很主观
I have a very biased view on that subject.

715
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,490
我已经听过她的想法了
Well, I've heard hers.

716
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,820
说说你的吧
Give me yours.

717
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,280
琳达和我时不时会有争执
Linda and I don't always agree.

718
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,100
但她对您忠心耿耿
But she's been very loyal to you,

719
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,510
是一名非常得力的幕僚长
and a more than competent Chief of Staff.

720
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,240
你觉得我该挽留她吗
So you think I should keep her?

721
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,730
我觉得她有时会管太宽吗
Do I think she oversteps sometimes?

722
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,670
没错
Yes.

723
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,200
她错以为自己的意见和我的一样重要吗
Does she wrongly equate her advice with mine?

724
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,470
常有的事  但是
Often. But...

725
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,780
我想到的问题不在于琳达
the question that occurs to me is not about Linda.

726
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,390
就算您回绝了她的辞呈
Let's say you refuse her resignation,

727
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,380
消息很有可能传出去
if this gets out, and it could,

728
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,940
这样所有为您的工作的人  不是都会觉得
won't you be sending a signal to anybody who works for you that...

729
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,280
他们可以跟您谈判
...you can be leveraged.

730
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,840
她已经递了辞呈
She offered her resignation.

731
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,160
即便留下来心也不在这儿了
She's already gone even if she stays.

732
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,790
梅根  他们准备好了
Megan. They're ready.

733
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,910
我不知道  我手一直在抖
I don't know, my hands are shaking.

734
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,350
你没问题的  梅根
You can do this, Megan.

735
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,460
我也会在场
I'll be there.

736
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,140
我有时会恐慌发作
I get panic attacks sometimes.

737
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,870
-你怕待会儿会发作吗  -对
- You're afraid you'll get one? - Yeah.

738
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,510
好吧  那我们再多等几分钟吧
OK, why don't we ask for a couple more minutes,

739
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,590
-不成问题  -不是时间的问题
- that's not a problem. - It's not about that,

740
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,790
恐慌说来就来
they just come.

741
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,860
我无法控制
I can't control them.

742
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,130
我不想做了
I don't want to do this.

743
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,390
梅根  屋里面有很多
OK, Megan, there's some of the most senior congressmen

744
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,320
资深国会议员
and women in the room,

745
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,780
还有媒体  他们专程为你而来
and the press, they've shown up just to hear from you.

746
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,630
我知道
I know.

747
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,250
好  我不想给你施压
OK, I don't want to pressure you,

748
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,990
但是我们为了这个策划了很久
but a lot of planning has gone into this.

749
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,260
请别逼我做这个
Please don't make me do this.

750
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,410
我们不是想逼你做什么
We're not making you do anything.

751
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,850
那我可以回家吗
Then can I just go back home?

752
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,740
-回芝加哥  -听着  你紧张
- Back to Chicago? - Listen, you have nerves,

753
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,570
这可以理解
that's understandable.

754
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,420
我他妈不想做了  好吗
I don't wanna fucking do it, OK?

755
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,820
我理解你  没关系
I understand, it's OK.

756
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,080
但你要是现在退缩  梅根
But if you back out now, Megan...

757
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,110
这根本不是为我  对吧
This isn't about me at all, is it?

758
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,580
对我们会很不好  有损我们的形象
...this is not good for us. It hurts us,

759
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,410
让人觉得我们很松散
it makes us look unorganized.

760
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,200
这他妈是你亮相的机会
This is about your fucking moment to shine.

761
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,720
你根本不在乎我怎么样
You don't fucking care if do...

762
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,430
我在乎  真心在乎
I do care. I do care.

763
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,060
这是为了我  也是为了你
It is about me and about you!

764
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,890
不管是为什么
And for whatever reason,

765
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,660
我们都说出了我们的经历
we both decided to share what happened to us.

766
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,280
人们在乎  人们愿意倾听
And it mattered and people listened

767
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,890
所以我们进去善始善终吧
so let's go in and finish what we started.

768
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,930
我做不到  我不合适
I can't, I'm not the right person.

769
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,620
来吧  梅根
Come on, Megan.

770
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,090
你知道我昨晚做了什么吗
You know what I did last night?

771
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,730
我在酒吧里找了个男的
I picked up some guy at a bar.

772
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,800
我完全不认识他
A total stranger.

773
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,470
我让他在酒店里疯狂地干我
I let him fuck my brains out at the hotel.

774
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,690
前天晚上也是如此
Night before, same thing.

775
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,490
我停不下来
I can't stop.

776
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,950
只有这样我他妈才能...
It's my only way to fucking...

777
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,420
老天  真讨厌这样
Jesus, I fucking hate this

778
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,180
我的手一抖我就...
when my hands shake like this and I...

779
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,420
没事的
It's OK.

780
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,230
-没事的  -我不是你想要的代言人
- It's OK. - I'm not who you want to be your poster girl.

781
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,670
你不想的话就算了  不想就算了吧
You don't have to be. You don't have to be.

782
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,180
很抱歉我让你失望了
I'm sorry I'm letting you down.

783
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,580
没事的  你没让我失望
It's OK, you're not letting me down.

784
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,530
没事了  没事的
It's OK. It's OK.

785
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,580
什么时候发表正式声明
When will it become official?

786
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,500
总统今天下午就打电话
President will make his call this afternoon.

787
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,790
正式批准将在明天上午宣布
Official approval will be announced in the morning.

788
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,610
协议内容没有改动吧
No revisions to the agreement?

789
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,810
没有  一切都写在提案里了
None. Everything is as spelled out in the proposal.

790
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,250
那我会履行我的承诺
Then I will uphold my end of the bargain.

791
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,720
切断资金流
The money will be cut off.

792
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,130
你说要证明  现在我们也要
You required proof. Now we want some.

793
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,490
什么证明
What sort?

794
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,210
你的诚意
Of your commitment.

795
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,140
你终止和塔斯克的合资项目
You kill your co-venture with Tusk.

796
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,670
我们当初可没说到这个
That was never part of the deal.

797
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,770
现在说了
It is now.

798
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,890
贸易战持续的话  精炼厂的事也成不了
The refinery can't proceed while we're in a trade war.

799
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,900
我们要你彻底取消跟他的合作
We want you to kill it for good.

800
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,650
并且今天就办
And we want you to kill it today.

801
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,250
给塔斯克打电话吧
Make the call to Tusk.

802
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,740
现在是上班时间  要说公事吗
It's business hours. Is this a business call?

803
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,050
不是
No...

804
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,290
我也希望不是公事
I was hoping it wasn't.

805
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,880
你今晚有什么安排吗
What are you doing tonight?

806
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,490
我马上要上飞机了
Just about to get on a plane.

807
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,840
到哪里去
Where to?

808
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,040
不是说了分清界限吗
Boundaries, remember?

809
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,120
公事才有界限
Work related.

810
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,530
我不是去度假
I don't take vacation.

811
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,360
你什么时候回来呢
Can you tell me when you'll be back?

812
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,760
明天  很快就回来
Tomorrow. It's a quick trip.

813
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,420
想和我共进晚餐吗
Do you want to have dinner?

814
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,860
好啊
I'd like that.

815
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,400
带上你的行李吧
Bring your carry-on.

816
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,340
吃完饭顺便过夜
You can stay over after.

817
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,990
进来
Yes.

818
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,140
你有空吗
Do you have a moment?

819
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,070
当然有
Absolutely.

820
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,680
总统一个小时前接受了我的辞呈
The president accepted my resignation an hour ago.

821
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,410
我知道
Yes, I know.

822
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,280
我差点说我改变心意了
I almost told him that I changed my mind,

823
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,210
但我意识到没有挽回余地了
but I realized it wouldn't make any difference.

824
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,180
不管怎样
For whatever it's worth,

825
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,480
我提到了你的忠诚
I did bring up your loyalty

826
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,060
以及你出色的工作
and how good you are at your job.

827
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,720
虽然他并不需要我的提醒
Not that he needed me to remind him.

828
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,410
你举荐了我  我会一直心怀感激
And I will always be grateful you recommended me.

829
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,110
这段路很精彩
It has been quite a ride.

830
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,440
虽然比我想的短了一点
Shorter than I would've hoped,

831
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,050
但还有大好前途等着我呢
but I have a long career ahead.

832
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,110
当然了
No doubt.

833
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,300
我想告诉你
And just so you know,

834
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,540
我不想造成任何舆论风波
I don't plan on making any fuss in the press.

835
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,710
如果有人问  我一定都是溢美之辞
You'll hear nothing but my praises if I'm asked.

836
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,100
我有样东西要给你
I have something for you.

837
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,830
几星期前
A few weeks ago,

838
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,490
总统跟我说起在你家的那顿晚饭
the president told me about a dinner he had at your house.

839
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,000
他不停地说你的内战模型
He went on and on about your Civil War models.

840
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,610
还说跟你一起给玩具士兵上色可开心了
How much fun he had painting the toy soldiers with you.

841
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,910
这是史密森尼的主管给我的
This was given to me by the director of the Smithsonian.

842
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,910
{\an8}位于美国华盛顿的一系列博物馆和研究机构的集合组织

843
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,850
是第一枚授予美籍西班牙人的荣誉勋章
It's the first Medal of Honor awarded to a Hispanic-American.

844
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,860
是授予约瑟夫·德·卡斯特罗下士的
Corporal Joseph De Castro.

845
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,190
他为联军作战
He fought for the Union.

846
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,930
琳达  我不知道该说什么好
Linda, I don't know what to say.

847
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,100
很显然总统把你当朋友看
It's clear the president sees you as a friend.

848
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,310
但没把我当过朋友
I've never been that to him.

849
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,630
但是他的工作超过友谊
But his job is bigger than friendship.

850
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,980
比我们俩都要重要
It's bigger than you and me.

851
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,590
我希望你能好好辅佐他  弥补我的遗憾
I just hope you'll look out for him the way I've tried to do.

852
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,630
我会的
I will.

853
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,870
我也会好好珍惜这枚勋章
And I'll treasure this.

854
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,790
再见  副总统先生
Goodbye, Mr. Vice President.

855
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,030
我从未像此刻这样尊敬她
I've never thought higher of her than I do at this moment.

856
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,660
她输了  但她拼尽全力了
She lost, but she played to win.

857
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,210
安德伍德买通冯了
Underwood got to Feng.

858
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,520
精炼厂没戏了
The refinery's dead.

859
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,860
格雷森耍了我们
Grayson played us.

860
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,600
我们别无选择
We're running outta options.

861
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,410
你怎么想  珍
What do you think, Jean?

862
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:33,890
去他的
Fuck him.

863
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,100
动手
Do it.

864
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,830

他的情况时好时坏
He has his good days and his bad.

869
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,990
今天还不错
This is a good day.

870
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,650
他希望在你们结束后能和你聊聊

871
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,750
当然可以
Of course.

872
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,250
牧师在里面
The reverend's in here.

873
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,150
沃克夫人
Mrs. Walker.

874
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,290
你好
Hello.

875
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,050
总统先生
Mr. President.

876
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,540
牧师
Reverend.

877
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,280
有什么可以效劳
How can I help?

878
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,730
你得在这屋里装个电扇  弗兰西斯
You need to get a fan in here, Francis.

879
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,340
空调已经在全速运转了
Well, the AC is all the way up to full blast.

880
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,690
我是说胶水的味道
I mean from the fumes, the glue.

881
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,300
这也是乐趣的一部分嘛
Oh, that's half the fun.

882
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,140
梅根·汉纳希今天临阵退缩了
Megan Hennessy bailed on us today.

883
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,830
为什么
Why?

884
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,820
她太紧张了
Her nerves got to her.

885
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,580
她决定不在公众面前露面
And she decided she didn't want to be in the public eye.

886
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,820
那倒也可以理解
Well, we can sympathize with that.

887
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,560
道格的电话
That was Doug.

888
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,660
怎么了
Yes.

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}琳达所担任的白宫幕僚长是美国联邦政府内一个非常重要的职务
在白宫内可谓"一人之下  万人之上"  不仅直接对总统负责
管理白宫内其他所有雇员  担任着"大内总管"的角色
同时也是总统应对危机  制定政策时最依赖的顾问和心腹
奥巴马上任五年  白宫内迎来过五位幕僚长
首任幕僚长伊曼纽是奥巴马在芝加哥的老乡  曾在克林顿政府任职
据说美剧《白宫风云》中乔什·莱曼的角色就是以伊曼纽为原型
他也是奥巴马白宫迄今为止最有影响力的一名幕僚长
正是在他的努力推动下
奥巴马才得以在入主白宫后不久就通过了全民医保法案
伊曼纽担任幕僚长两年后"告老还乡"  回芝加哥担任市长
此后几名幕僚长都没有太大的影响力

美国政府一度打算用武力打击阿萨德政府
但是奥巴马对是否动武一直犹豫不决
一天晚餐后  他同现任幕僚长麦当诺在白宫草坪散步45分钟
散步结束  奥巴马连夜召开会议  决定放弃直接武装打击的策略
转而寻求国会授权  武力干预叙利亚的决定最终被搁置

他们对其所居住的保留地享有一定程度的自主权
1976年美国最高法院裁定地方政府无权干涉印第安人对保留地的开发使用
随后大量赌场开始在印第安保留地出现
虽然美国各州政府一度试图对赌场进行限制
但是1988年美国国会通过的《印第安赌博管理法案》
正式承认了印第安人在保留地上开设赌场的权利
由于法案规定只有传统的印第安部落才有资格进行赌场运营
所以1988年之后  出现了大量要求印第安人事务局进行认证的部落
目前美国有326个印第安保留地  约500多个被认证的部落
其中240个部落经营着460间赌场  每年赌场收入高达270亿美元
