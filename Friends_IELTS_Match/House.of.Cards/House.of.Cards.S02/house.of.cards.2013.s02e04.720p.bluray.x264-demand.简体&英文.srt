00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,240
{\an8}{\pos(191,62.2)}多数党党鞭办公室  杰奎琳·A·夏普

2
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,620
{\an8}倾向同意

3
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,620
{\an8}中立

{\an8}{\pos(297.6,178.2)}弗兰克·安德伍德

{\an8}{\pos(290.64,189.64)}国会封锁

6
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,500
{\an8}{\pos(297.84,203.14)}我困在这儿了

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,160
换了名字真不习惯
Strange not seeing your name up there.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,760
"变则善"
"To improve is to change."

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,560
"常变则至善"
"To perfect is to change often."

10
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,220
很熟悉丘吉尔的名言嘛
You know your Churchill.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,000
我离职去格兰顿-希尔时  你送我的表上刻的
It's inscribed on a watch you gave me when I left for Glendon Hill.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,430
是吗  礼物的事都是南茜安排
Was it? Nancy arranges all the gifts.

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,410
她真了解你
She knows you well.

14
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,490
虽然我很喜欢跟你...
As much as I am enjoying this little --

15
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,570
我又争取到两票  帕崔奇和克劳斯
I got you two more votes. Partridge and Krauss.

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,110
雷蒙德是在向我递橄榄枝吗
Is this Raymond's way of extending an olive branch?

17
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,850
算个开端吧
It's a start.

18
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,960
两票太少  算不上树枝
Two votes is a twig. It's not a branch.

19
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,400
所以我来了
Which is why I'm here.

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,350
五点开始投票  还剩不到三小时
Well, the vote's at 5:00. We have less than three hours.

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,240
2小时49分钟
Two hours and forty-nine minutes.

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,090
足够我们拉票了
We have made more happen in less.

23
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,450
是我送的表吗
Is that the watch?

24
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,810
不是  比那个好
No. It's nicer.

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,480
雷蒙德为什么改主意了
So, why did Raymond have a change of heart?

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,040
政府停转对谁都没好处
If the government grinds to a halt, that benefits no one.

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,720
我们想让总统专注于中国问题
We want the President focused on China,

28
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,360
而不是为停转和抗议分心
not distracted by furloughs and protests.

29
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,650
听杰奎琳的安排吧
You take direction from Jacqueline.

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,220
她恐怕不会喜欢那样
She's not gonna like that very much.

31
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,300
不喜欢支使你吗
Bossing you around?

32
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,330
不喜欢见我
Having me around.

33
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,810
不怪她
Oh, I don't blame her.

34
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,920
阿什利会先问
Ashleigh will start the interview with questions

35
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,120
你和丈夫的相识  早期的婚姻
about how you and your husband met, your early marriage.

36
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,980
好
Fine.

37
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,630
然后会问一些关于你近况的
Then she'll move on to more specific questions

38
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,450
具体问题
about your recent transition.

39
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,360
好的
All right.

40
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,000
她还要问你不要孩子的事
She's gonna ask about you having no children.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,880
不是说好不问这个吗
I thought we'd agreed to take that off the table.

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,980
是的  但他们一定要问
We did. But they insisted.

43
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,770
我可以直接找阿什利争取
Now I can speak to Ashleigh directly and fight for --

44
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,860
没事  以前也有人问过
No. It's fine. I've been asked the question before.

45
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,960
我知道怎么回答
I know how to answer it.

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,060
尽可能短  不戳痛处
It'll be quick and painless.

47
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,240
阿什利来了我跟她确认一下
And I'll confirm that with Ashleigh when she gets here.

48
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,120
这件不错
I like it.

49
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,970
还是别这么中性化
Maybe something less neutral.

50
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,070
你穿什么都好看
I'm sure you'll look good in whatever you choose.

51
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,190
我去楼下等
I'll be downstairs.

52
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,440
狄所里欠你的  你帮他搞定了天桥的资金
Disori owes you -- for the overpass funding you secured.

53
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,500
-没错  -我给他打电话
- Yes, he does. - I'll call him.

54
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,370
道格呢
Where's Doug?

55
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,860
四处巡视  巩固来之不易的胜利
He's doing the rounds, making sure our hard-won stay hard.

56
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,800
博奇和乌麦克也是  不过还是少15票
Birch and Womack are doing the same. But we're still 15 short.

57
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,920
我跟他们都有联系
Got relationships with most of these folks.

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,000
钱还不够
Money's not enough.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
我试过民主党议会竞选委员会拨款的路数了
I already tried the D-trip route.

60
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,020
退休问题是关键对吧
Retirement is the main sticking point, correct?

61
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,690
老人也有投票权的
Old people vote.

62
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,360
我去找退休人员协会  应该能减轻压力
I'll target the AARP. That'll take most of the heat off.

63
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,520
这是浪费时间  我得去工作了
We're wasting our time. I gotta get to work.

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,930
带上雷米吧
Take Remy with you.

65
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,910
不该分头行动吗
Shouldn't we divide and conquer?

66
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,380
两个人更有说服力
It's harder to say "no" twice than once.

67
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,450
我尽量不碍事
I'll stay out of your way.

68
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,890
像《特拉华河流域法案》那次吗
Like you did on the Watershed Act?

69
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,430
这次我们在一边
We're on the same side of the fence this time.

70
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,970
你来晚了
You're late to the party.

71
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,770
就当雷米是你走投无路
Well, think of Remy as the guy who shows up

72
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,650
给你雪中送炭的人吧
with a six-pack after the liquor store is closed.

73
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,040
接下来见谁
Who's on your plate?

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,600
唐纳德·布莱斯
Donald Blythe.

75
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,500
见他不浪费时间吗
Do you really think that's the best use of your time?

76
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,650
除非他能说服他的同盟
If I can get him to turn his people.

77
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,380
这么多鸡蛋放一个篮子里够冒险的
That's a lot of eggs to put in one basket.

78
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,480
可只有一个篮子
We only have one basket.

79
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,340
杰奎琳  能借用你的办公室吗  我比较恋旧
Uh, Jacqueline, may I use your office, for old time's sake?

80
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,350
全听副总统的
I serve at the pleasure of the Vice President.

81
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,730
2小时17分钟
Two hours and seventeen minutes.

82
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,920
有时间和耐心通常就能说服唐纳德·布莱斯
Normally, all I need to sway Donald Blythe is patience and time,

83
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,240
可现在我两样都没有
neither of which I have right now.

84
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,380
时间不多了
Tick, tock.

85
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,470
唐纳德  你好
Donald. Good to see you.

86
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,460
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

87
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,590
别客气  还是叫弗兰克吧
Please, it's always "Frank" to you.

88
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,660
你找我  所以我来了  但我不会帮你
I came because you asked me, but don't mistake that for false hope.

89
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,570
抓紧时间去说服别人吧
If you have other people to lobby, you should.

90
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,720
十分钟
Ten minutes.

91
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,910
无济于事的
It won't change anything.

92
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,190
至少喝杯咖啡  反正不要钱
Well, at the very least, enjoy the free coffee.

93
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,580
我不喝咖啡因饮料
I don't drink caffeine.

94
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,720
那就脱咖啡因的
Then decaf.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
那不还是咖啡因吗
Still has caffeine.

96
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,100
那就享受一下免费的氧气
Well, enjoy the free oxygen.

97
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,510
众议院办公楼那边待久了会闷
It's gets stuffy over there in the Longworth Building.

98
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,040
给我来杯咖啡  然后
Coffee for me, and, uh...

99
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,340
气泡矿泉水  如果你们有的话
Seltzer water, if you have it.

100
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,550
我们肯定有
I'm sure we do.

101
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,040
如果你记仇的话  我很理解
Now I can understand if you might hold a grudge.

102
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,140
我不记仇  弗兰克
I don't hold grudges, Frank.

103
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,630
我只是不和本性虚伪的人谈判
I just don't negotiate with people who are fundamentally deceptive.

104
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,340
我从没对你说过谎  唐纳德
I never lied to you, Donald.

105
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,150
你保证说要和我讨论  结果你并没有
You promised to seek my counsel, which you never once did.

106
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,500
当时我们不得不把《教育法案》推到
We had to move the education bill in a direction

107
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
我知道你不会喜欢的方向上去
I knew would make you unhappy.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,790
-我觉得不该去伤...  -你重创了工会的元气
- I saw no reason to frustrate  - You eviscerated the unions.

109
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,530
你把绩效标准交由联邦统一
You federalized performance standards.

110
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,800
我们要是不那么做  法案就完蛋了
If we hadn't done that, the bill would've been dead in the water.

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,430
然后现在你又想再继续克扣你通过的那点资金
And now you want to cut the pathetic level of funding you did manage to pass.

112
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,720
有点钱总比没有好吧
Isn't some funding better than none?

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,750
死了比变成植物人更能说明问题
A flat-line will send a louder message than life support.

114
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,850
听着  你凑出来的这个小同盟
Look, I, I'm impressed with the little coalition

115
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,880
确实了不起
that you've cobbled together,

116
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,020
-但是我们  -也没那么小
- But we  - Not so little.

117
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,990
28票  你需要每一票
Twenty-eight votes. And you need them all.

118
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,640
其实一半就够了
Well, really only half.

119
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,630
零的一半还是零
Half of zero is still zero.

120
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,360
为了让福利改革通过参议院
I had to pull every trick in the book

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,830
我什么手段都用了
to get entitlement through the Senate.

122
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,040
如果众议院没通过  我们没有再来的机会
If it fails in the House, we don't get a round two.

123
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,420
这是一锤子买卖
This is a one-time deal.

124
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,930
在参议院就不该通过
It never should've passed the Senate to begin with.

125
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,520
我们从头开始好吗  我可以向你道歉吗
Can we start over? May I offer you an apology?

126
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,230
我不想听  弗兰克
Deaf ears, Frank.

127
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,760
我退出了《教育法案》
I withdrew myself from the education fight,

128
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,720
那是我必须抗下的负担
and that is my cross to bear.

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,560
但我一个错误绝不会犯两次
But I will be damned if I will make the same mistake twice.

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,820
你这么固执  沦落到茶党的档次上了
This sort of stubbornness makes you no better than the Tea Party.

131
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,760
只不过  我们是正确的一方
Except for the fact that we happen to be right.

132
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,950
再坐几分钟  唐纳德
Just a few more minutes, Donald.

133
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,140
你水都还没喝呢
You haven't even had your seltzer yet.

134
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,550
他们在东北部还有七个数据中心
They have seven other data centers spread across the Northeast.

135
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,750
那希望太渺茫了吧
Those aren't good odds.

136
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,930
如果我们能进入一个
Well, if we can access one,

137
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,300
我应该就能和另七个通信
I should be able to talk to the other seven.

138
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,240
它们都长那样  像是核掩体里的诺克斯堡
And they all look like that, Fort Knox wrapped in a nuclear bunker.

139
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,220
我们怎么进去呢
How do we get in?

140
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,170
不是我们  是你
Well, we don't. You do.

141
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,490
怎么进  我用什么理由进
How? Wh--what's my reason?

142
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
你要写一篇关于网络恐怖主义的文章  免费宣传
You're writing a story on cyber terrorism. It's free publicity.

143
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,650
但是如果他们安保那么严密
But if they're so secure, I'm --

144
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,290
他们经常安排参观  主要面向潜在客户
They give tours all the time, mostly to prospective clients.

145
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,990
那你自己为什么不去呢
Then why haven't you done it yourself?

146
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,800
因为我开了家网络安全公司
Because I run a white-hat firm.

147
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,690
如果我刚参观完  那里就遭入侵
And if I were to show up in the tour logs before a breach,

148
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,080
会引起注意的
it would raise alarms.

149
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,670
好吧  我进去之后呢
Okay, once I'm in?

150
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,140
服务器都是这个样子的
These are what the servers look like.

151
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,040
你得进入随便一个笼子里
You're gonna get inside one of these cages.

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,060
你拿着这个  插到服务器上
You will have this. You slide it into the server.

153
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,240
-就这样  -就这么简单吗
- Voila.  - It's that simple?

154
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,470
你要做的就这些  我可不是  代码极端复杂
Yeah. Well, your part. Not mine. The code's extremely complex.

155
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,780
我怎么做到这些还不被他们发现呢
How do I do it without them noticing?

156
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,270
和想要做好任何事一样
How you get good at anything:

157
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,120
熟能生巧
Practice makes perfect.

158
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,960
出了个状况
We've got a problem.

159
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,200
所有人  停下手头的工作  去最近的办公室
Everyone, stop what you're doing, head into the nearest office,

160
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,640
把门关上
and shut the door.

161
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,250
你  原地不动
You, stay exactly where you are.

162
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,680
退休年龄已经敲定了
Retirement age is a done deal,

163
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,920
但我也许能拨一些款项去...
but I might be able to redistribute some appropriations to oth--

164
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,530
那不是我想要的
That's not what I'm after.

165
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,200
你不能安个新轮毂罩就当修车了
You can't fix a wrecked car with new hubcaps.

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,260
一个姊妹法案怎么样  完全针对教育问题
How about a sister bill, one that focuses entirely on education.

167
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,160
我的同盟是在为党的尊严而战
My coalition is fighting for the integrity of the party.

168
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,860
-我们并不是只注重教育  -不好意思  唐纳德
- Tha- We're not just focused on Education.  - I'm sorry, Donald.

169
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,720
稍等一下
Excuse me for a moment.

170
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,290
南茜  我说了  勿扰
Nancy, I said, 'No interrup'—

171
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,490
什么时候
When?

172
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,420
但还有不到一小时就开始投票了  我
But the vote is in less than an hour. I

173
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,630
我才不管什么程序
I don't care what protocol it--!

174
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,900
隔离  邮件中有白色粉末
Quarantine. There's white powder in the mail.

175
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,950
我们被关在这儿了吗
We're locked in?

176
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,460
先生  马上把门关上
Sir! Close the door now!

177
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,280
听着  我必须
Look, I have to --

178
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,850
马上  先生  请关门
Now, sir! Please!

179
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,680
我得给我太太打电话
I should call my wife.

180
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,270
我也得给克莱尔打个电话
And I should call Claire.

181
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,870
我应该告诉康纳吗
Should I tell Connor?

182
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,790
不要  最好别让媒体知道
No. It's better the press doesn't know.

183
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,590
检测结果应该能在投票开始前出来
The field tests should come in before the vote.

184
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,340
投票结束我就回家
And as soon as the tally's in, I'll come home.

185
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,540
情况怎么样
How's it looking?

186
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,810
挺危险  这次可能通不过
Shaky. We may lose this one.

187
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,650
那采访就难办了
That could make for a tough interview.

188
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,600
我本来就不想接受采访
Well, I didn't want to do it in the first place.

189
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,410
现在没法后悔了
Well, we're committed now.

190
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,170
我得回去应付"圣十字军"了
I better get back to the Holy Crusader.

191
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,610
检测一旦确认安全  就告诉我
Let me know as soon as the tests have cleared.

192
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,050
如果走运  是炭疽病毒
If we're lucky, it'll be anthrax,

193
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,930
我也不用亲眼看着法案不通过了
and I won't live long enough to see the bill fail.

194
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,030
别这么说
Don't say that.

195
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,700
会没事的
We're gonna be fine.

196
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,730
这样的隔离我们都经历过多少次了
How many of these quarantines we been through?

197
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,690
我都算不清了
I've lost count.

198
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,520
祝我能劝动唐纳德吧
Wish me luck with Donald.

199
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,000
土地爷保佑
Heels crossed.

200
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,760
-党团为此四分五裂  -当然
- It's ripping the caucus apart. - Of course.

201
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,990
我们要一起坚持用我们这版法案
We take a united stand on our version of the bill.

202
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,720
我们有些人得立场坚定
Some of us have to stay on our feet.

203
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,490
事关党内团结
This is about party unity...

204
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,370
这是让我们放弃根基
It's about abandoning our base.

205
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,840
不  冻结开销才是动摇根基
No, that's what the Freeze is.

206
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,680
刀兵相向对我们的根基没什么好处
Our base doesn't benefit from sword-rattling.

207
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,520
只会搞得乌烟瘴气
It gets left bleeding on the field.

208
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,720
我的选区内的老年人数目在国内第三多
My district has the third largest number of seniors in the country.

209
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,350
如果提高退休年龄  退休人员协会肯定要吵翻天
If we raise the age of retirement, the AARP will raise hell.

210
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,980
我今早和退休人员协会的主席谈过
I spoke with the President of the AARP this morning.

211
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,890
他下周将收到一笔四千五百万的捐款
He'll be receiving a $45 million endowment next week.

212
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,230
选民还是会抗议的
Voters will still revolt.

213
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,970
中期选举会很艰难
The midterms are gonna be ugly.

214
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,980
我们很多人  当然也包括我...
Many of us – And I can certainly speak for myself – are fac --

215
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,070
现在的选择是  政府立刻停摆
The choice is between immediate discontinuation of services

216
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,740
或是五年后提高退休年龄
and an age bump five years from now.

217
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,710
你是在拿假想的不适跟眼前的痛苦相比
You're comparing theoretical discomfort to imminent pain.

218
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,670
我只是觉得我们在跟核心价值观背道而驰
I just feel like we're losing touch with our core values.

219
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,480
《教育法案》就是个很好的例子
The Education Bill is a good example.

220
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,860
我们跟着弗兰克走
We all followed Frank's lead,

221
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,220
希望能靠他多少牵制一下共和党
hoping it would buy us traction with the Republicans.

222
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,750
失陪一下  马上回来
Would you excuse me, just one moment?

223
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,950
-媒体知道了吗  -还不知道
- Does the press know? - Not yet.

224
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,350
能和他保持联系吗
Can you keep in touch with him?

225
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,640
我得想办法让午餐宾客从命
I need to pommel our lunch guests into submission.

226
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,660
你已经很接近了  放轻松  多听
You've got 'em close. But relax. Listen more.

227
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,690
他们想要的是支持  而不是打击
They want their hands held, not someone in their face.

228
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,050
我知道怎么拉票
I know how to whip votes.

229
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,520
请享用特区最好的鱼子酱  女士们先生们
Best caviar in D.C., Ladies and Gentlemen.

230
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,030
我们怎么能让你付钱
We can't let you pay for that.

231
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,880
那就别吃  如果吃了我也不会说出去
Then don't eat it. But if you do, I won't tell anyone.

232
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,250
你刚刚说到《教育法案》是吗
You were saying about the Education Bill?

233
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,030
不  玛乔莉亲爱的
No, Marjory, honey.

234
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,850
记得吗  我们刚刚才说过
Remember, we just talked about it.

235
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,300
我刚刚在说...
I was telling you –

236
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,860
对  没什么好担心的
Right. Nothing to worry about.

237
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,850
如果有什么疑问  就去问莫莉
If you have any questions, ask Molly.

238
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,230
她知道怎么回事
She knows what's going on.

239
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,190
我知道任何消息就会马上联系你
I will call as soon as I know anything.

240
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,970
我爱你
I love you.

241
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,780
玛乔莉怎么样
How's Marjory?

242
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,170
她还好
She's okay.

243
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,730
电话打得挺长
Long call.

244
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,310
她情绪比较激动
You know, she gets emotional.

245
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,830
莫莉休学了一个学期待在家里
Molly took a semester off to be at home.

246
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,710
我告诉她  她春季必须回去
I told her she needs to head back in the spring.

247
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,700
我不希望她妈妈拖她后腿
I don't want her mother dragging her down.

248
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,040
你真是不容易
Must be hard on you.

249
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,010
我觉得女儿们更不容易
Harder on the girls, I think.

250
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,960
-她意识清醒吗  -一半时间是吧
- Is she lucid? - About half the time.

251
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,460
勉强能明白自己恶化得多快
Just enough to be aware of how quickly she's going.

252
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,710
真糟糕
Awful.

253
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,280
我知道我不该这么说
I feel terrible saying it,

254
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,000
但我心底更希望她别清醒过来
but part of me is looking forward to her not being lucid.

255
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,600
至少那样她就不会知道发生了什么
At least then she won't realize what's happening.

256
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,720
我之前就该想到的
I should have thought of this before.

257
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,910
将心比心  而不是靠讲道理
Appeal to the heart, not the brain.

258
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,000
我对这方面不太了解  但
Forgive my ignorance, but

259
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,180
这方面的研究有什么进展吗
has there been any progress with research?

260
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,340
一些  基因测试  血管改造  但进展很慢
Some. Genetic testing, vascular manipulation, but it's slow.

261
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,970
玛乔莉赶不上这些研究的成果了
They won't come up with anything in time for Marjory.

262
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,530
所以我们只想提高生活质量
We're focusing on quality of life.

263
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,080
听着  我知道你还有事  我...
Look, I -- I know you have work to do, so...

264
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,340
我已经不是党鞭了  那是杰奎琳的工作
Oh, I'm no longer the Whip anymore. That's Jacqueline's job.

265
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,160
我同意见你  是因为我们有交情
I just agreed to meet with you because we have a history.

266
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,220
很难拒绝她吧
She would be tougher to say not to.

267
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,410
-但还是该拒绝的  -没错
- But still it would've been a "no". - Yes.

268
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,510
我佩服你的信念  唐纳德
I admire your convictions, Donald.

269
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,430
如今像你这样的人凤毛麟角了
You're a rare breed nowadays.

270
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,090
你拿我们跟茶党比的时候  可不是这么说的
It didn't sound that way when you were comparing us to the Tea Party.

271
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,110
我不该那么说
I was being unfair.

272
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,450
你不是反动派  是进步分子
You're not a reactionary. You're a progressive.

273
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,860
我明白你的意思
I see where this is going.

274
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,800
什么意思
How do you mean?

275
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,130
我坐了这么久冷板凳
When you've been in the wasteland as long as I have,

276
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,910
对奉承已经有免疫力了
you become immune to flattery.

277
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,160
我知道你认为我是个本性虚伪的人
I know you think I'm fundamentally deceptive,

278
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,180
但我也能真诚地赞美别人
but I am capable of a genuine compliment.

279
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,230
那我就谢谢你了  但这不会动摇我的决心
Then I will take it as one, but it won't soften my resolve.

280
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,000
当然  否则你就配不上这赞美了
If it did, you wouldn't deserve the compliment in the first place.

281
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,000
如果你们投了反对票  我也不会指责你们
If you vote ':no,' I won't hold it against you.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,410
我们是一条阵线的  中期选举也是
We're all in this together through the midterms.

283
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,390
但如果你们跟我走
But if you stick with me,

284
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,030
我们就让共和党和美国人民知道
we can show both the Republicans and the American people

285
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,620
我们不是就会闹僵
that we are capable of more than stagnation.

286
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,020
这是很重要的  就算会有些痛苦
And that's worth something, even it if hurts.

287
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,780
你们谁跟我走
Who can I count on?

288
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,280
收到
Copy that.

289
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,300
我们之间还隔着道门  我猜不是好兆头
The fact that there is still a door between us, I take as a bad sign.

290
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,730
一份样本检测呈阴性  一份不确定  先生
One tested negative, one inconclusive, sir.

291
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,630
所以我们必须把样本带回实验室
That means we have to take the samples to the lab.

292
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,900
那还要多久
So, how much longer?

293
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,580
还需要三四个小时吧
Another three or four hours.

294
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,640
我们有一项重要投票要举行
We have an important vote going to the floor.

295
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,680
我必须跟我的人谈谈
I have to be talking to my people.

296
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,290
投票已经延期了  先生
The vote is delayed, sir.

297
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,220
我们正在疏散国会大厦这一侧
We're evacuating this side of the Capital.

298
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,450
不投票了吗
So no vote?

299
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,330
在我们确认没问题之前不会投票了
Not until we get the all-clear.

300
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,080
好人有好报
Good things happen to good people.

301
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,160
还有一件事  先生
Another thing, sir.

302
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,180
所有的手机服务  无线网  座机
All cell phone service, Wi-Fi, land lines --

303
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,210
我们都会封锁  以防潜在安全威胁
We'll be blocking them, in case there's a legitimate security threat.

304
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,410
我得跟我妻子保持联系
I need to be able to call my wife.

305
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,470
抱歉  先生  我们可以找人通知她
I apologize, sir. We can have someone notify her.

306
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,730
不  必须是我才行
No. It needs to be me.

307
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,480
如果是陌生的声音  会让她非常紧张
She gets very anxious if she doesn't recognize the voice.

308
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,440
议员先生  我被严令禁止...
Congressman, I have strict instructions not to allo—

309
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,610
想办法解决  除非你想让我把白宫扯进来
Figure it out. Unless you want me to get the White House involved.

310
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,000
我会想办法的  先生
I'll find a way, sir.

311
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,150
当副总统还是有好处的
There are advantages to being Vice President.

312
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,010
夫人  我们得要求您暂时留在这里
Ma'am? We'll have to ask you to remain up here for a little while.

313
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,240
是因为隔离吗
Is it the quarantine?

314
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,150
国会大厦正在疏散
The Capitol is being evacuated.

315
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,150
应该不会有问题
We expect everything to be fine.

316
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,560
只是标准程序
It's just standard procedure.

317
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,870
打不通的  通讯中断了
Uh, you won't be able to get through. Communication is being jammed.

318
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,950
我没法跟弗兰西斯通话吗
You mean I can't even speak to Francis?

319
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,010
确认安全之前不行
Not until the all-clear.

320
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,950
要多久
How long?

321
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,660
现在估计要四小时
Four hours is the estimate right now.

322
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,540
25分钟后就要录影了
We're supposed to tape it in 25 minutes.

323
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,600
我们无能为力
Nothing we can do.

324
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,590
你还好吗
You okay?

325
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,060
是的
Yes.

326
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,020
我去找艾玛谈谈
I'll go talk to Emma.

327
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,580
没事了  谢谢你
You know, I'm fine. Thank you.

328
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,650
艾玛
Em.

329
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,250
我们可能有点问题
So we might have a problem.

330
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,590
新闻里都报道了
It's all over the news.

331
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,500
可能还要一阵子
It could be a while.

332
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,130
我们能通过音频采访副总统吗
Can we get audio from the Vice President?

333
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,000
在疏散结束之前通讯都是中断的
Communications are being jammed until the evacuation is over.

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,940
你跟阿什利谈过了吗
Have you spoken to Ashleigh?

335
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,350
她觉得我们该弄辆转播车来  回头直播
She thinks we should get a sat truck down here. Wait and go live.

336
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,090
我没法保证什么时候能恢复
I can't guarantee when that will be.

337
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,980
副总统被隔离在国会大厦  我们有独家新闻
The Vice President is quarantined in the Capitol, and we have an exclusive.

338
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,370
不管我们何时开工  电视台都会转播的
The network will broadcast whenever the hell we tell them to.

339
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,740
他们会等你到达
They're holding off until you get here.

340
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,230
你应该独自做采访
You should do the interview solo.

341
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,280
我想等你
I'd rather wait.

342
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,050
谁知道我们能不能赢得投票
Who knows whether we'll win the vote?

343
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,710
如果我们输了  我可不想上全国电视台
If we lose, I don't want my face on national television.

344
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,640
这或许也是好事
This could be a silver lining.

345
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,200
我不知道  弗兰西斯
I don't know, Francis.

346
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,250
你肯定会很棒的
I'm sure you'll be terrific.

347
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,620
我跟康纳商量一下吧
Let me run it past Connor.

348
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,050
好的  谢谢  我们说完了
Okay. Thank you. We're done.

349
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,380
先生  我们接通了布莱斯太太
Sir, we were able to get Mrs. Blythe.

350
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,520
唐纳德
Oh, Donald...

351
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,010
玛乔莉
Marjory?

352
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,070
-喂  -对  是我  亲爱的
- Hello? - Yes, it's me, sweetheart.

353
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,560
听不清你说话
It's hard to hear you.

354
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,150
我们还被困在办公室里
We're still stuck inside the office.

355
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,480
什么办公室
What office?

356
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,860
在国会大厦  还得要一阵子
At the Capitol. It --it's going to be a l—a little while longer.

357
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,260
但你为什么去那里  今天是星期天啊
But why are you there? It's Sunday.

358
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
不  今天是星期五  亲爱的
No, it -- it's Friday, sweetheart.

359
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,190
-唐纳德  -我在呢
- Donald? - I'm here.

360
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,060
跟我在一起的男人是谁
Uh, who is this man with me?

361
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,900
他是一位警察
Uh, he's a police officer.

362
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,760
他们用对讲机让我们通话
They're using walkie-talkies so we can speak.

363
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
我在跟谁说话
Who am I talking to?

364
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,670
是您丈夫  夫人
It's your husband, ma'am.

365
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,690
我没结婚
I'm not married.

366
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,830
是我  是唐纳德
It -- It's me. It's Donald.

367
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,830
关上  我不认识那个人
Turn it off. I don't know that man.

368
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,060
玛乔莉
Marjory...

369
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,700
她去另一个房间了  先生
She went into the other room, sir.

370
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,750
好的
Okay.

371
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,870
谢谢
Thank you.

372
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,800
能麻烦你陪着她吗
If you could stay with her, please...

373
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,910
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

374
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,610
喝一杯吗
Drink?

375
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,060
好啊
Sure. Why not?

376
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,780
他可能要到午夜才有空
For all we know it could be midnight before he's out.

377
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,250
然后他还要主持投票
And then he still needs to manage the vote.

378
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,510
凌晨两点我们也没问题
We're fine if it's two a.m.

379
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,540
大家都睡着的时候播吗
When everyone's asleep?

380
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,890
人们会为这个熬夜的
People would stay up for this.

381
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,360
关键就是想在黄金时段播
The whole point was prime time.

382
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,410
那我们明天再进行
Then we do it tomorrow.

383
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,100
我们已经为这个推掉半天的日程了
We've already set aside half a day for this.

384
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,510
副总统不会为一个访谈重新安排一整天的日程
The Vice President can't rearrange his entire schedule for an interview.

385
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,400
眼下也没有其他的选择
I don't see any other options.

386
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,510
我和弗兰西斯用对讲谈过了
I spoke to Francis over the radio.

387
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,960
我们认为我应该单独接受采访
We think I should do it alone.

388
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,800
只有您一人
Just you?

389
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,410
安德伍德夫人和阿什利  一对一
Mrs. Underwood and Ashleigh, one-on-one.

390
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,580
也许我们可以转播他的录音
Maybe we can broadcast his voice

391
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,640
弗兰西斯不希望访谈完全是关于隔离的
Francis doesn't want the entire interview to be about the quarantine.

392
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,570
我也一样  那只是个小插曲
Neither do I. That's just spectacle.

393
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,360
隔离是新闻  这是难得的机会
The quarantine is news. We have a unique opportunity --

394
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,450
那好  我们取消吧
Fine. We're done.

395
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,250
-什么  -取消访谈  不重新安排
- What?  - Cancel the interview. No reschedule.

396
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,930
别这样  康纳
Come on, Connor.

397
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,330
请你收拾好东西离开
Please pack up everything and leave.

398
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,420
好吧  我给阿什利打电话
Okay, wait. Let me call Ashleigh.

399
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,070
我以为我会逐渐习惯
I thought I'd get used to it,

400
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,220
但我没有  每次还是很痛苦
but no. Hurts every time.

401
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,270
你和一个人一起生活了三十年
You spend 30 years with someone,

402
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,250
而现在她甚至不知道你是谁
and then they don't have a damn clue who you are.

403
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,370
我真的不应该
Ugh... I really shouldn't...

404
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,660
如果我们不该做的事就不做
If we never did anything we shouldn't do,

405
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,350
那就体会不到做该做的事的成就感了
we'd never feel good about doing the things we should.

406
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,980
说的好
Excellent point.

407
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,130
如果这是我们生命最后的时刻
And if these are our last moments on earth

408
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,420
我不知道你怎么打算  我倒宁愿喝醉了
I don't know about you, but I'd rather go out with a buzz on.

409
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,900
敬玛乔莉
To Marjory.

410
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,360
你非常爱她
You love her dearly.

411
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,450
胜过其他一切
More than anything.

412
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,460
我不敢想象没有克莱尔我该怎么办
I can't imagine what I'd do without Claire,

413
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,500
或是如果她记不起我是谁
or if she didn't remember who I was.

414
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,790
但愿你不会遇到这样的情况
Hopefully, you'll never have to.

415
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,530
可你  或是任何人遇上这种事都让我觉得生气
Well, it makes me angry that you do, that anybody does.

416
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,200
没必要为你不能改变的事而生气
No sense being angry over what you can't change.

417
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,440
老年痴呆的研究有多少经费
How much funding does Alzheimer's research get?

418
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,890
不到五亿
Just under $500 million.

419
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,810
我不是专家  但这个数听上去有点少啊
Well, I'm no expert, but that sounds inadequate to me.

420
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,540
确实是  如果分配一百块用于研究
It is. For every $100 we allocate to research,

421
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,600
就得花将近三万用于看护
we spend nearly $30,000 on care.

422
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,930
得改变这种情况
We oughta change that.

423
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,000
我试过了  我的法案都没通过委员会
I tried. My bill didn't even leave committee.

424
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,900
谁反对
Who opposed it?

425
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,110
霍华德·韦伯
Howard Webb.

426
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,760
拨款委员会的
Ugh. Appropriations.

427
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,350
他都没让法案投票
He didn't even put it to a vote.

428
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,230
我向来不喜欢霍华德
I've never been fond of Howard.

429
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,100
我也一样
That makes two of us.

430
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,850
他的原因是什么
What was his argument?

431
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,460
他觉得他不欠我的
He didn't feel he owed me one.

432
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,450
"浪费开销"  他就说了这一句
'Fiscally irresponsible,' is all he said.

433
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,020
跟我好好说说你的法案
Walk me through the specifics of your bill.

434
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,980
我知道你要干什么了
I see what you're doing.

435
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,410
干什么
Doing what?

436
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,020
你真让人恶心  弗兰克
You're disgusting, Frank.

437
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,140
你说什么
Excuse me?

438
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,570
利用我妻子
Using my wife.

439
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,960
唐纳德  你在说什么
Donald, what are saying?

440
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,430
你以为你多给老年痴呆一点研究经费
You think I'll give in on Entitlement

441
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,660
我就会在福利改革修正案上妥协
if you slap some extra Alzheimer's funding on the table?

442
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,650
我完全没这个意思
I was not suggesting that at all.

443
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,820
胡说  弗兰克
Bullshit, Frank.

444
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,640
你可以随便看低我
You think as little of me as you want,

445
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,470
但我不拿健康作交易筹码
but I do not barter with people's health.

446
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,690
那你为什么要上调退休年限
Then why are you trying to raise the age of Retirement?

447
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,440
医疗研究  我们负担得起
Medical research we can afford.

448
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,840
医疗保险  我们负担不起  这是现实  唐纳德
Medicare, we can't. There are realities, Donald.

449
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,220
别和我谈什么现实  我妻子在渐渐死去
Don't talk down to me about reality. My wife is dying.

450
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,560
这才是现实  如果你的法案通过
That's a reality. Other people will die, too,

451
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,820
还有其他人会死  这才是现实
if your package succeeds. That's a reality.

452
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,800
该死的
God damn it.

453
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,210
真希望我没跟你一起困在这儿
I wish I wasn't stuck in this fucking room with you.

454
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,810
唐纳德
Donald?

455
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,310
我不想再说什么了
I'm done talking.

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,670
-再来一次  -我能行
- One more time. - I've got it.

457
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,270
我希望听起来更自然
I want it to sound more natural.

458
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,500
弗兰西斯和我想献身公共事业
Uh, Francis and I both wanted to devote our lives to public service.

459
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,910
而我们一致认为投身公职
And we didn't feel that we could both do that

460
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,920
就难以善尽父母之责
and be the parents we wanted to be.

461
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,910
所以我们作了取舍  让我们有更多时间
And by making that choice it allows more time for us

462
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,300
为其他人服务
to be in the service of others.

463
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,640
很好  听起来很好
Good. That sounds good.

464
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,050
请过来吧  安德伍德夫人
We need you, Mrs. Underwood.

465
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,070
让德里克待在国会大厦
Keep Derek at the Capitol.

466
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,530
采访被疏散者和国土安全部
I want quotes from evacuees and Homeland Security.

467
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,810
让萨拉完成生化威胁历史的部分
And Sarah should be finishing that history of biohazard scares.

468
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,550
我很快就过去
I'll be there soon.

469
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,910
我要走了
I have to go.

470
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,770
不行  我们还没干完
No. We're not done yet.

471
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,880
这是个大新闻  我明天再过来
This is a major story. I'll come back tomorrow.

472
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,190
那样你就是连续两天都是如此  这就有了规律
Gonna be two days in a row, and this is how patterns emerge.

473
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,970
联调局喜欢规律  我们不能去撞枪口
The FBI likes patterns, and we do not give the FBI what the FBI likes.

474
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,890
我不能一整天都消失  现在正是...
I can't disappear all day in the middle of –

475
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,550
我有八个记者正在外面跑新闻
I have eight reporters out in the field,okay?

476
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,620
别说了
Stop.

477
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,750
告诉我  我为什么要买腰果
Tell me why I purchased Cashew.

478
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,320
我不知道
I don't know.

479
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,800
为了陪伴我吗
Companionship?

480
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,380
是的
Yes.

481
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,740
更重要的是  提醒我自己
More importantly, a reminder that I am never

482
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,590
我距离被关进笼子也只有一步之遥
more than one wrong move away from life in a cage.

483
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,450
你留下来
You stay.

484
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,100
我让你看看我要写的全部代码
I'll walk you through every line of code I intend to write,

485
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,980
我对防火墙的每一次攻击
every attempt I make to breach the wall.

486
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,900
如果我们被抓  你不能说自己一无所知
If we get caught, you don't get to plead ignorance.

487
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,880
我们一起进去
We go down together.

488
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,190
不  我不是来玩雌雄大盗的
No, I didn't sign up for Bonnie and Clyde.

489
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,340
你需要我做这一件事
You need me for this one thing.

490
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,970
我也需要你  但无论我来之前你做了什么
Just like I need you. But whatever you've done before me, that --

491
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,500
你知道我住在哪里  你知道我是谁
You know where I live. And you know who I am.

492
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,520
坐下  我们越早开始  就能越早结束
Sit down. The sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

493

国会大厦依然封锁
The Capitol is still on lockdown,

494
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,300
防化小组还在继续检查整栋大厦
as HAZMAT crews continue a thorough sweep of the building.

495
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,070
今天早上  一封寄给多数党党鞭
Earlier this morning, a white powder-like substance...

496
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,530
杰奎琳·夏普的包裹中
...was found in a package mailed to the office

497
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,450
发现了白色粉末状物质
of Majority Whip Jacqueline Sharp.

498
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,970
我们现在可以走了吗
Not are we free to go?

499
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,020
快了  不到一小时
Almost, sir. Less than hour.

500
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,910
我有一条你太太发来的消息
I've got a message from your wife.

501
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,980
什么消息
What is it?

502

她正在做现场采访
She's doing the interview live right now.

安德伍德夫人  我非常感激你
Mrs. Underwood, I so appreciate you

506
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,840
能在今天这种情况下与我们对话
taking the time to speak with us today in what,

507
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,450
你现在一定很担心
I am certain, is a very stressful situation.

508

谢谢  阿什利
Thank you, Ashleigh.

509
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,740
你今天跟你丈夫通过话吗
Have you spoken with your husband today?

510
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,300
是的  他状态很不错
Yes, I did. And he's in very good spirits,

511
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,110
特情局保护得很周到
and in good hands with the Secret Service.

512
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,090
当然  对于不能来他感到很失望
Of course, he's very disappointed he couldn't be here.

我想要从你在德克萨斯州
I'd like to begin with Claire Underwood

517
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,410
遇到你丈夫之前开始说起
before she met her husband, in Texas.

518
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,190
我有一些照片
And I have a couple of pictures.

519
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,050

你是个熟练的骑手吗
An accomplished rider?

522
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,620
狂热的骑手
Uh, an enthusiast.

523
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,910
这张是几年以后的照片
This one's from a couple of years later.

524
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,090
天呐
Oh, my goodness.

525
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,190
你喜欢这双皮便鞋吗
You like those penny loafers?

526
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,130
妙极了
Those are wonder—

527
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,300
这是两个截然不同的女孩
Those are two very different girls.

528
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,200
你更喜欢做哪一个
Which one are you more comfortable being?

529
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:04,170
我家的农场  那是我的家园
My family's ranch. That was home…for me.

530
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,130
你不喜欢预科学校吗
You didn't like the prep school?

531
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,690
不  我想我更喜欢泥巴
No. I think I preferred the dirt.

532
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,250
但你在达拉斯长大  在海兰帕克
You grew up in – in Dallas, though. Um, Highland Park.

533
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,320
是的  我父亲  他是个生意人
Yes. My father, um, well, he was a businessman,

534
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,860
所以我们住在城里  但我们是农场主
So we lived in the city, but we're ranchers.

535
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,890
我们家过去三代人都是
I mean, we – we go back three generations, our family.

536
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,010
你父母非常有钱
Your parents were very wealthy.

537
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,650
我们过得很舒坦  没错
Uh, we were comfortable, yes.

538
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,280
他们让我应有尽有
They made sure I wanted for nothing.

539
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,360
的确是个快乐的童年
It was a very happy childhood.

540
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,290
那段时间你最鲜活的记忆是什么
What is your most vivid memory from that time?

541
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,190
我"最鲜活的记忆"
My 'most vivid memory.'

542
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,340
可能是我九岁或十岁的时候
Probably when I was about nine or ten,

543
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,460
我父亲带我去了肯尼迪遇刺的迪利广场
my father took me to Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was shot.

544
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,110
他说"克莱尔  一位伟人死在这里"
And he said, 'Claire, a great man died here.'

545
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,520
我记得我当时还不完全理解死亡的概念
And I remember not fully comprehending the meaning of death yet.

546
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,420
我问他总统怎么死的  他就跟我说了
And I asked him how he died, and he told me.

547
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,810
我记得我感到十分难过和愤怒
And I remember feeling so sad, so angry.

548
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,190
这太不公平了
It seemed so unfair.

549
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,200
我哭了起来  然我后父亲抱起我
I started to cry, and my daddy picked me up.

550
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,420
他用胳膊搂着我
And he wrapped his arms around me,

551
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,450
然后说道  "别伤心  宝贝儿
and he said, 'Don't be sad, sweetheart.

552
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,000
他让世界变得更好了
"He made the world a better place,

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
但有时这是要付出代价的"
but sometimes that comes at a price.'

554
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,560
我想这就是我最鲜活的记忆了
I guess that was the most vivid memory.

555
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,150
我们就差八票了
We are only eight votes away.

556
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,610
抱歉  我心意已决
I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.

557
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,200
我也一样  我得坚持立场
Me, too. I've gotta stick to my guns on this one.

558
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,770
你们宁愿让政府关门...
You would rather let the government shut down --

559
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,880
你注意点
Hey, hey, hey.

560
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,050
这你怨不着我们
Don't put that on us

561
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,960
谁叫党鞭大人最后才想起来我们
just because we're on the ass-end of the whip list.

562
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,480
别误会  我们都很敬重你  杰姬
Don't get us wrong. We have a lot of respect for you Jackie.

563
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,420
弗兰克升任之后你一直干得不错
You're doing a fine job since Frank's gone.

564
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,120
也许风格不同  但还是很好的
Different styles, but a fine job.

565
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,300
请诸位稍候片刻
Excuse us just a moment.

566
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,550
他们根本不拿我当回事
They're not taking me seriously.

567
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,980
因为你不是弗兰克
'Cause you're not Frank.

568
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,310
你是说我不是个男人
You mean because I'm not a man.

569
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,880
不  我就是说弗兰克  他们都习惯了做交易
No. I mean Frank. They're used to being offered something.

570
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,920
问问他们有什么要求
Ask them what they want.

571
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,780
我知道保罗在垃圾处理厂的事上需要帮忙
I know Paul needs help with a waste treatment facility.

572
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,200
你也和他们一样瞧不起我
You're being just as condescending as they are.

573
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,110
有好建议送到眼前  就接受吧
Take some good advice when you get it.

574
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,230
我之前就说对了  是不是
I was right earlier, wasn't I?

575
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,400
保罗  雷米告诉我你需要一间垃圾处理厂
Paul, Remy tells me you need a waste treatment plant.

576
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,030
我们在申请联邦基金方面是有点麻烦
We've had some trouble getting matching federal funds.

577
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,820
本  你说你想在选区内盖一座葡萄酒博物馆
Ben, you mentioned once a winery museum in your district?

578
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,700
我们长岛如今的葡萄酒是很不错的
We are making some great wines in Long Island these days.

579
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,000
我喝过啊
I've tried some.

580
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,850
跟我们纳帕[著名酒乡]产的比起来难喝得要死
It tastes like piss, compared to what we have in Napa,

581
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,780
这种东西正好该送去保罗的垃圾处理厂
the sort of piss that belongs in Paul's waste treatment plant.

582
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,560
杰姬
Jackie--

583
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,830
我们刚遭遇了一场疑似恐怖袭击
We have a possible terror attack,

584
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,620
而你们还在这儿持票待沽
and you're holding out your plate for more pork.

585
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,130
你们真该为自己感到羞愧
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

586
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,730
我治下党团  党员只会因优异表现受嘉奖
In my caucus, people are rewarded for good behavior,

587
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,140
我不会鼓励拿选票换酬金
not trading their votes for ransom.

588
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,470
待会儿进去投票  你们两位都要投赞成
When we walk in there, I expect the both of you to vote 'yes,'

589
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,510
而且要毫不犹豫
without a moment's hesitation.

590
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,930
多谢两位回心转意
Thank you for your change of heart.

591
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,970
只剩六票了
Six more to go.

592
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,650
你离开德州  在著名的菲利普斯学院
You left Texas and, um, spent the last two years of high school

593
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,910
度过了中学最后两年
at the prestigious Phillips Academy.

594
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,030
-然后考进了拉德克利夫学院  -是的
- Um, and then, onto Radcliffe. - Yes.

595
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,030
{\an8}哈佛大学两个本科生院之一  专收女生

596
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,980
就是在那儿  你邂逅了未来的美国副总统
Where you would meet the future Vice President.

597
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,450
他那时只是个帅气的法学院学生
Back then just a dashing law student.

598
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,530
我从没想到他会成为副总统
I never dreamed he would become Vice President, of course.

599
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,270
有人认为你们的婚姻比你说的
Some people might think that your marriage may be a bit more

600
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,780
要有更多的算计
calculated than you let on,

601
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,450
也许他用得上你家的财富
that perhaps he needed your family's money.

602
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,860
不  不是这样的
No. That's just not true.

603
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,400
你父亲可是为他的竞选投入不少
Your father did contribute an awful lot to his campaign.

604
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,110
没错  因为他相信弗兰西斯
Yes, he did. Because he believed in Francis.

605
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,360
如果没有你父亲的资助
Would he have won that campaign

606
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,450
他还能赢得选举吗
had it not been for your father's contributions?

607
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,610
这不好说  我父亲的资助绝对起了作用
I don't know. I mean, it certainly helped.

608
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,480
但我认为  是弗兰西斯的理念和领导力
But I like to think that it was Francis' ideas and leadership

609
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,770
说服了选民  而不仅仅是竞选广告
that convinced voters, not just TV commercials.

610
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,930
你和副总统已结婚27年了
You've been married for 27 years.

611
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,110
是的
That's right.

612
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,610
你们结婚时还在上学  那时你们都很年轻
You were just in school. I mean, you married so young.

613
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:27,890
没错  但如果找到了真爱
We did. But when you've found 'the one'…

614
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,850
弗兰西斯就是我的真爱
well, Francis was the one.

615
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,170
你称呼他为"弗兰西斯"
You call him "Francis."

616
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,870
在老家  他们还是叫他"弗兰克"
Well, back home, they call him "Frank," still.

617
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,930
但他喜欢我叫他"弗兰西斯"
But he likes that I call him "Francis."

618
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:42,340
他说这称呼让他显得更老成
He said it makes him sound more sophisticated.

619
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,100
当政治家的妻子难吗
Is it hard being a politician's wife?

620
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,490
令人兴奋  但也有难处
It's thrilling. Not without its challenges.

621
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,810
甘居幕后  为了他的追求而委屈自己
Always in the background, subsuming your goals for his goals.

622
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,570
我倒不这么看
No, I don't see it that way.

623
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,580
我们都是非常独立的人
We're two very independent people who

624
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,300
只是选择共同经营生活而已
have chosen to live our lives together.

625
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,700
我支持他  他也支持我
I support him. He supports me.

626
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,500
这就回到了政治上的合作的话题上
Which, you know, goes back to the political partnership.

627
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,900
我丈夫的确是位政治家
Well, my husband happens to be a politician,

628
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,040
而我也正好从事政治工作
and I happen to do political work.

629
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,830
但我们的关系远不止如此
But our partnership extends far beyond that.

630
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,890
孩子呢
Children.

631
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,440
这是你们做的牺牲吗
Was that a sacrifice?

632
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,340
因为你们还没生过孩子
Because you haven't had any.

633
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,670
弗兰西斯和我想献身公共事业
Francis and I wanted to devote our lives to public service.

634
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,240
而我们一致认为投身公职
And we didn't feel that we could both do that

635
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,370
就难以善尽父母之责
and be the parents we wanted to be.

636
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,140
所以我们作了取舍
So, we made the choice.

637
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,220
这回答我们之前听过了
We've heard that answer before.

638
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,030
你说什么
Sorry?

639
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,430
你在以前的访问中给出过一模一样的回答
You have given the exact same answer in previous interviews.

640
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,240
因为这是事实
Because it's the truth.

641
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,680
不好意思  但是"工作"和"时机"
Forgive me, but 'career' and 'timing,'

642
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,240
人们总会找这样的借口
uh, those are often very convenient answers.

643
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,050
从有这个念头到真正去做之间有个过程
It is true that whatever it takes for people to get

644
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,500
而我一直没能走完这个过程
from 'maybe' to 'yes' never arrived for me.

645
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,160
你不觉得有压力吗  没有做母亲的渴望吗
Never felt the pressure? No maternal instinct?

646
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,410
没有
No.

647
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,550
那么这是你的选择  并不是你不能生育
And it was a choice? It wasn't because you couldn't have any?

648
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,960
弗兰西斯和我是为了大局着想
Well, Francis and I did what was right for us.

649
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,520
因为即使是现在
Because it is unusual, I mean, even now,

650
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,730
身在领导层的政治家没有孩子
for politicians at the executive level

651
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,450
也是不寻常的事
not to have children.

652
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,680
是的
Yes, it is.

653
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,700
你丈夫第二次参加国会竞选时
In your husband's second congressional campaign,

654
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,100
有一位反堕胎的共和党候选人
there was a Republican, a pro-family candidate,

655
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,880
他对你们做了一些相当难听的指责
who made some pretty unsettling accusations.

656
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,630
弗兰西斯是一位南方民主党人
Well, Francis is a Southern Democrat,

657
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,390
我俩的脸皮都很厚
and we have thick skins.

658
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,300
他说  为了保住你丈夫的政治生涯
He suggested, in order to keep your husband's political career on track.

659
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,080
孩子是很多人生活的中心
Children are the center of many people's lives.

660
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,500
我认为他们只是想确保
And I think they just want to make sure that

661
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,600
选出的议员会为了他们孩子的未来奋斗
their representatives will fight for their children's dreams.

662
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,610
而弗兰西斯已经一次又一次地证明了自己
And Francis has, again and again, proven that he will.

663
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,110
作为副总统他也会继续做出努力
And he will continue to do as Vice President.

664
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,390
他还声称在竞选时你可能已经怀孕
He claimed that you may have been pregnant during the campaign.

665
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,240
你当时怀孕了吗
Was there a pregnancy?

666
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,910
你怀过孕吗
Have you ever been pregnant?

667
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,520
-马上停播  -不行
- Break. Now. - That's not gonna happen.

668
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,020
怀过
Yes.

669
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,220
在竞选期间吗
During the campaign?

670
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,490
之前
Before.

671
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,170
是流产了吗
Was it a miscarriage?

672
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,250
不是
No.

673
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,660
你终止了妊娠吗
Did you – did you terminate the pregnancy?

674
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,720
如果我说"是"
If I said 'yes,'

675
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,400
我丈夫的政治生涯就会面临危险
my husband's political career would be in jeopardy.

676
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,000
我的信仰会遭质疑
My faith would be questioned.

677
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,480
同样  我的生活也会受到威胁
Likely, my life would be threatened.

678
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,370
但我不会感到羞耻  是的  我怀过孕
But I won't be ashamed. Yes, I was pregnant.

679
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,170
而且是的  我堕过胎
And, yes, I had an abortion.

680
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,460
能休息几分钟吗
Can you excuse me for one moment?

681
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,700
当然可以  稍后继续为您带来
Of course. We'll have more of our live interview

682
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,610
与克莱尔·安德伍德的直播访谈
with Claire Underwood when we return.

683
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,950
那可需要极大的勇气
That took a lot of guts.

684
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,290
是啊
Yes, it did.

685
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,290
不行  那看上去像是我觉得羞愧
No. It'll look like I am ashamed.

686
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,240
但我没有  我也不会
I'm not. And I won't.

687
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,140
你再怎么说都无法挽回
Nothing you can say will make this any better.

688
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,820
我宁愿去解决麻烦...
I'd rather deal with the dama--

689
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,160
我不会逃避这个问题
I'm not going to run from this.

690
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,010
她会问你为什么要堕胎
She's gonna ask why you had the abortion.

691
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,520
不止一次  是三次
I haven't had one. I've had three.

692
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,020
三次  不行  你必须坚称只有一次
Three? No. You need to stick to one.

693
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,030
好吧
Okay, fine.

694
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,140
告诉我你要说什么
Tell me what you'll say.

695
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,760
我不能说出真相
Well, I can't use the real reason.

696
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,000
前两次我还未成年  我做事不顾后果
The first two, I was a teenager, and I was reckless.

697
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,240
那第三次呢
What about the third?

698
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,810
那篇她给我看的文章写得没错
Well, the article that she showed, it's right.

699
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,070
我当时在吃避孕药
I was on the pill.

700
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,690
但没有起效果
It didn't work.

701
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,100
我们讨论过要小孩  最终决定不要了
We talked about having a baby, and then we decided against it.

702
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,970
为什么
Why?

703
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,020
因为我们在专心忙竞选的事
Because we were focused on the campaign.

704
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,120
怀孕多少个星期了
How many weeks in?

705
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,310
16周
Sixteen.

706
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,460
这些你绝不能说
You can't say any of this.

707
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,790
上楼去  我来应付阿什利
Go upstairs. I'll deal with Ashleigh.

708
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,080
如果要继续的话  还有20秒就开始了
If we're going to continue, we've got about 20 seconds.

709
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,220
康纳  我
Connor, I --

710
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,570
请相信我  不然你会犯大错的
Please, trust me. You'll be making a big mistake.

711
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,340
你愿意谈谈当时的情况吗
Are you willing to discuss the circumstances --?

712
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,110
我的怀孕是一次性侵造成的
I became pregnant as a result of a sexual assault.

713
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,510
你是说你被
Are you saying that you – you were --?

714
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,580
强奸了
Raped.

715
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,060
你之前从没公开说过这件事
You've never spoken about this publicly about this before.

716
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,050
没有人过问
No one ever asked.

717
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,870
你能讲讲发生了什么吗
Can you tell us what happened?

718
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,460
是上大学的时候  一个在和我约会的同学
Uh, it was college. A classmate, we were dating.

719
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,710
发生在...有一次我们吵架了
And it happened on a – We had a fight,

720
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,900
然后他强暴了我
and he forced himself on me.

721
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,960
你和别人说过这件事吗  他被起诉了吗
Did you tell anybody about it, and did he --? Was he charged?

722
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,510
没有  因为当时我觉得错似乎在我身上
No. Because at the time I felt that I was somehow at fault.

723
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,590
我知道我没错
I knew I wasn't,

724
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,300
但我不想被别人指指点点
but... just didn't want to be stared at.

725
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,670
我不想别人叫我"被强暴的女孩"
I didn't want to be known as 'the girl who got raped.'

726
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,790
当发现怀孕的时候  我不想辍学
And when I became pregnant, I wasn't going to drop out of school.

727
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,560
我不想让那个男人毁了我的生活
I wasn't going to let this man ruin my life.

728
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,710
所以我做出了决定  选择堕胎
So I made a choice. I ended it.

729
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,110
但是如果你选择保持沉默
But if you never told anybody about it,

730
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,860
袭击者可能还逍遥法外
the assailant could still be out there.

731
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,950
你能讲讲关于他的事吗
Can you tell us anything about him?

732
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,040
就在几个月前
I saw him, uh,

733
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,950
时隔三十年  我又见到了他
for the first time in almost 30 years just a few months ago.

734
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,130
在哪里
Where?

735
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,630
在弗兰西斯和我出席的授衔典礼上
At a commissioning ceremony that Francis and I attended.

736
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,530
你和他说话了吗
You speak to him?

737
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,660
说了几句  弗兰西斯为他授了衔
Briefly. Francis pinned stars on him.

738
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,250
他是授衔者吗
He was being commissioned?

739
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,260
道顿·麦金尼斯将军
General Dalton McGinnis.

740
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,840
我要声明一下  弗兰西斯知道那次强奸
And for the record, Francis has always known about the assault.

741
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,060
只是不知道是谁
He just didn't know the name.

742
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,620
这些年来  他一直十分支持我
And he's been nothing but supportive all these years.

743
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,050
我们得和将军取得联系
W—--w--we're gonna have to reach out to the General.

744
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,420
看看他对你的话作何回应
for a response to what you just said.

745
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,650
请问我们能不能  稍事休息
Would you mind if we took a quick break?

746
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,330
当然
Absolutely.

747
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,100
稍后继续克莱尔·安德伍德夫人的访谈
We'll be right back with Mrs. Claire Underwood.

748
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,190
不着急  慢慢来
Take all the time you need.

749
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,970
实验室检验结果全是阴性  先生
The lab tests all came back negative, sir.

750
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,780
那玩意是什么
What was it?

751
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,590
混了面粉的滑石粉
Talcum powder laced with flour.

752
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,240
小麦里的农药让检测呈假阳性
It was pesticide from the wheat that gave us the false positive.

753
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,710
-那我们可以走了吧  -是的  先生
- So are we're free to go? - Yes, sir.

754
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,510
-南茜  告诉他们我这就下楼  -已经告知了
- Nancy, let them 'em I'm on my way down. - I already did.

755
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,800
-不介意我用你的电话吧  -请便
- Mind if I use your phone? - Of course.

756
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,850
还有  唐纳德  我会帮你搞到研究资金的
And, Donald? I'm gonna get you that research funding,

757
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,530
无论投票结果如何
no matter how the vote goes.

758
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:58,330
-你自己看着办  我还是会投反对票  -理解
- It's your call, because I'm still voting against it. - I understand.

759
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,620
你妻子很勇敢  弗兰克
You have a brave wife, Frank.

760
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,690
你妻子也是  唐纳德
So do you, Donald.

761
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,720
弗兰克
Frank!

762
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,020
你怎么样
How'd you do?

763
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,410
-还剩四个  布莱斯怎么样  -还是不让步
- We're down to four. How about Blythe? - He won't budge.

764
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,200
你给了他什么好处
What did you offer him?

765
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,490
老年痴呆症的研究经费  他觉得这是侮辱
Alzheimer's research. He was insulted.

766
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,070
投票还有45分钟就要开始了
The vote's in 45 minutes.

767
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,070
我得联系上克莱尔  上车后我该打给谁
I need to get to Claire. Who should I call from the car?

768
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,210
我们没别的办法了
We've exhausted our options.

769
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,050
不说服布莱斯那边  就通不过投票
It's either Blythe's people, or it won't pass.

770
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,410
他们对他太忠心了
They're too loyal to him.

771
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,250
行  去吧  我来解决
Okay. Go. I'll figure it out.

772
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,350
如果需要我  我可以留下来
I can stay if you need me.

773
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,320
不用  去找你妻子  我知道去哪找你
No. Get to your wife. I know where to find you.

774
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,280
南茜  手头所有的纸都给我  再找些推车
Nancy, I need every ream of paper you have. And get me dollies.

775
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,550
就快完成了  还有20分钟
Almost done. Twenty more minutes.

776
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,710
我讨厌撒谎
I hate lying.

777
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,420
-他做了那事吗  -做了
- Did he do it? - Yes.

778
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,750
那就别内疚
Then, don't feel bad.

779
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,390
要是他否认了呢
What if he denies it?

780
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,290
那就兵来将挡  水来土掩
Then we'll cross that bridge.

781
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,560
-康纳  -再等一分钟
- Connor? - Give us one more minute.

782
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,960
有个年轻女人打电话来  是内线
We have a young woman on the phone, a private.

783
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,180
她说她也被将军强奸了  两年前
She says she was also assaulted by the General. Two years ago.

784
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,830
她想说出她的故事  但不肯透露姓名
She wants to share her story, but she won't give her name.

785
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,320
如果她不透露姓名  就不能报道
We can't put her on if she's anonymous.

786
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,860
-你想让我说服她吗  -她很害怕
- You want me to convince her? - She's frightened.

787
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,730
她还在线上吗
Is she still on the phone?

788
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,070
我没和任何人说过
I've never told anyone.

789
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,020
我过了大半辈子  才有勇气说起这件事
It took me almost half my life before I could say anything.

790
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,810
但你现在能说了
But you can say something now.

791
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,650
我不知道
I don't know.

792
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,470
想想还可能有多少其他受害者
Just think of how many others there must have been.

793
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,400
但你想让我说出来
But you want me to talk.

794
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,140
如果你不想说  就不会打电话了
Well, would you have called if you didn't want to?

795
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,670
我没想到还得公开姓名
I didn't think I'd have to use my name.

796
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,510
听着  我理解你害怕后果
Listen, I understand you're afraid of the consequence.

797
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,550
我是个二等兵  而他是将军
I'm a private. He's a general.

798
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,690
而我丈夫是美国副总统
And my husband is the Vice President of the United States.

799
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,350
我们会保护你  我向你保证
We will protect you. I promise you that.

800
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,350
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

801
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,760
二等兵梅根·汉纳希
Private Megan Hennessey.

802
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,500
这是什么
What is this?

803
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,190
一旦开销冻结
The names of every person in America

804
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,980
以下所有人就会失去家庭医保
who will lose home care when the Freeze sets in,

805
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,810
失去一半的社会福利
who will lose half of their welfare benefits,

806
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,950
被迫休假  失去学生贷款
who will go on furlough, who will lose their student loans,

807
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,250
交通服务  战后创伤心理咨询  还要我继续吗
transportation services, post-combat counseling. Shall I go on?

808
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,660
我们得为大局着想  杰奎琳
This is about the big picture, Jacqueline.

809
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,280
我觉得这个局面已经很大了
This picture looks pretty big to me.

810
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,500
我不能投赞成票
I can't vote for the package.

811
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:59,470
那就别投  你们中有四个人就行
Then don't. Just get four of your people to do it.

812
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,040
避免政府关门后跟我合作
And then work with me after we avoid the Freeze.

813
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,650
我不是弗兰克·安德伍德
I'm not Frank Underwood.

814
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,440
那年至少还有另外两个女孩
At least two other girls that same year.

815
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,420
如果属实  那么他服役的这些年来...
If that was true for all the years he's served...

816
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,120
太让人震惊了
It's just staggering.

817
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,290
而且我觉得非常无助
And I felt so helpless.

818
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,350
然后他一直晋衔  受到体制的保护
And he keeps rising in the ranks. The system protects him.

819
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:28,460
你觉得为什么从来没有人告过他
Why do you think no one has ever reported him?

820
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,740
你想加入吗
Do you wanna join her?

821
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,590
-我们知道根本没用  -不想
- We know it won't do anything.  - No.

822
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,820
官大一级压死人
Chain of command.

823
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,750
你愿意出生入死地保卫我们的自由
It's inexcusable that you're willing to put your life on the line

824
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,000
然而你却无法自由说出实情
to defend our freedom, and yet you don't feel

825
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,950
这实在不可原谅
the freedom to come forward.

826
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,560
我热爱我的国家
I love my country.

827
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,050
我也喜欢在海军陆战队服役
And I love serving in the Marines.

828
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,230
但不是这样的
But not like this.

829
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:52,150
二等兵汉纳希  感谢你今晚如此勇敢  接受采访
Private Hennessey, thank you for your courage in joining us this tonight.

830
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,680
是安德伍德夫人给了我勇气
It was Mrs. Underwood who gave me the courage.

831
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,480
安德伍德夫人  也感谢你的坦诚
And, Mrs. Underwood, thank you, for your honesty.

832
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,650
长官  您夫人来电
Sir, your wife is on the phone.

833
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,990
你给了我们很多需要思考的东西
You've given all of us a great deal to think about.

834
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,580
谢谢你  阿什利
Thank you, Ashleigh.

835
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,640
与克莱尔·安德伍德的
And that concludes our live,

836
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,170
面对面独家直播专访到此结束

今天的专访就到这儿  感谢收看  晚安
But, for now, thanks for watching. And good night.

841
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,430
结束
And we're out.

842
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,130
这会引起超出你想象的轩然大波
This is going to make waves like you never imagined.

843
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,120
谢谢
Thank you.

844
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,000
卡特呢
Where's Carter?

845
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,910
你现在向我汇报了
You'll be reporting to me now.

846
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,580
那你是谁
And who are you?

847
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,830
卡特的上司
Carter's boss.

848
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,990
嘉文  你干得不错
You're doing good work, Gavin.

849
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,470
但是你不能对目标动手  那可能会让我们暴露
But you can't be assaulting the target. That could compromise us.

850
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,030
我都不知道为什么我们要追查这个人
I don't even know why you're going after this guy.

851
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,940
他根本不入流
He's small-time.

852
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,060
这不是你的事
That's not your concern.

853
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,830
他连写一行代码救自己的命都做不到
He couldn't write a line of code to save his life.

854
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,690
他想发动网络恐怖袭击
He intends to commit an act of cyber terrorism.

855
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,680
那只是个想法  不是能力  他不是真正的威胁
Well, that's intention, not capability. He's not a real threat.

856
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,060
也许卡特会跟你好言相劝
Maybe Carter talked things out with you.

857
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,310
我不会的
I won't.

858
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,590
还要多久
How much longer?

859
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:39,980
什么多久
Until what?

860
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,420
多久我才能收手
Until I can stop.

861
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,660
你更想进监狱吗
Do you prefer prison?

862
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,390
我帮你抓到了八个儿童色情制作者
I've given you eight child pornographers,

863
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,890
三个僵尸网络病毒制造者
three botnet masters...

864
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,280
但是你还是没有抓到AVunit
But you still haven't given us the AVunit.

865
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,270
我告诉卡特了  我不知道他在哪
Well, I told Carter I don't know where he is.

866
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,530
你知道
Yes, you do.

867
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,420
我不知道  谁也不知道
I don't. Nobody does.

868
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,710
那你在Dec-Sec的朋友呢
Then what about your friends in Dec-Sec?

869
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,470
我不会让你动我朋友的
I'm not giving you my friends.

870
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,960
那你就干这个吧  你是个很有用的线人  嘉文
Then you'll keep doing this. You're a productive asset, Gavin,

871
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,120
但等你没用了  什么律师也救不了你
but the moment you stop being productive, no lawyer can help you.

872
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,830
要是有根真的就好了
Wish we had the real thing right now.

873
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,120
时刻准备
Always prepared.

874
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,660
弗兰西斯
Francis.

875
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,450
我真怀念这样
I've missed this.

876
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,410
我也是

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2011年《新闻周刊》的一篇报道中指出
美国军队中女兵被战友性侵的可能要大于在战斗中阵亡的可能性
2013年美国国防部的报告认为
美军中每年发生的性侵犯案例可能多达1万9千宗
但只有1108名受害者报案
由于军队长官在军内性侵案的调查上有极大的决定权力
所以极少施暴者会受到军法处置
