提高退休年龄
Raising the age of retirement

40
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,770
是对美国梦不可容忍的侵蚀
is an unacceptable erosion of the American Dream.

41
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,530
如果共和党无法通过福利改革
If the Republicans fail to pass a reasonable Omnibus package

42
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,890
达成合理的综合解决方案
by demanding entitlement reform,

43
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,190
就会迫使联邦政府冻结开销
they will force the federal government into a spending freeze.

44
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,070
冻疮会长在他们手上  不是我们手上
The frostbite will be on their hands. Not ours.

45
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,330
这句是不是有点过了  冻疮那句
Do you think that's a bit much? The frostbite bit?

46
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,910
这是国情咨文  先生
Well, it's the State of the Union, sir.

47
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,540
我们想争取中部各州的支持
We want to appeal to the flyover states.

48
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,050
他们会喜欢那句话的
They'll like that line.

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,570
我想要点更有力的句子
I want something more forceful.

50
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,810
他们手上沾满血
Blood on their hands?

51
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,630
不行
No.

52
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,330
把我们丢回冰河纪
Throw us back into the ice age.

53
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,300
我喜欢那句  克里斯蒂娜  我们试试

琳达  克里斯蒂娜  你也过来
Linda. Christina, you come up here, too.

55
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,410
世上有两种副总统
There are two types of vice presidents.

56
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,480
受气包和斗牛士
Doormats and matadors.

57
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,530
你觉得我想做哪种呢
Which do you think I intend to be?

58
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,050
雷蒙德
Raymond.

59
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,270
他在为内政操心
He's hung up on the domestic agenda.

60
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,510
一句关于中国的话也没说
Not a single word about China.

61
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,790
他的直觉是对的
His instincts are right.

62
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,960
如果政府在演讲后第二天关门
If the government shuts down one day after the speech,

63
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,510
他讲了什么就完全不重要了
not a single word in the speech matters.

64
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,590
我们得马上解决冻结开销的问题
We have to address the freeze now.

65
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,820
中国的事得靠后
China comes later.

66
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,360
两党为了改革的事吵了几个月了
Both parties have been wrangling over entitlements for months.

67
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,660
未来三天里
What makes you think a miracle

68
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,810
怎么可能出现奇迹
is gonna happen in the next three days?

69
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,890
我们给共和党他们想要的
We give the Republicans exactly what they want.

70
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,220
退休年龄
Retirement age?

71
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,370
对
Yes.

72
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,680
那是不可跨越的界限
That's a line in the sand we cannot cross.

73
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,410
我们最终还是得跨  所以何必争下去呢
We will cross it eventually, so why keep fighting it?

74
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,910
我可以推动参议院通过法案
I can push this through the Senate.

75
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,080
一旦我做到  总统就能在国情咨文中
And once I do, the president will announce

76
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,370
宣布两党达成了一项重要协议
a major bipartisan agreement in the State of the Union.

77
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,990
我们避免了政府关门
We avoid a government shutdown,

78
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,180
而功劳归白宫
and the White House gets credit.

79
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,110
太冒险了
It's a huge risk.

80
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,500
一旦失败  会颜面扫地
And if it fails, a huge embarrassment.

81
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,630
那也是丢我的脸
The embarrassment will be entirely my own.

82
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,510
这事我来担
This is on my shoulders.

83
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,140
即使如此  也不好说服总统
Even so, the president is gonna require some serious persuasion.

84
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,830
我去跟他谈
I'm happy to talk to him.

85
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,360
别  我来吧
No. No. I'll do it.

86
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,100
朋友去说  他更容易接受
He'll be more amenable if it comes from a friend.

87
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,830
没错  可信的密友
You're right. A trusted confidant.

88
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,110
我去试试水吧
Let me test the waters.

89
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,110
塔斯克党  成员  一人
The Cult of Tusk. Membership: one.

90
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,790
不过那个信徒恰好是
But that one disciple just so happens to be

91
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,310
自由世界最有权力的人
the most powerful man in the free world.

92
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,140
至少目前还是
For now.

93
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,690
福利改革  把退休年龄提到67岁
The entitlements. Raising the age of eligibility to 67.

94
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,030
你们那边不会同意的
Your people will never go for it.

95
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,850
领导层同意  他们就会点头
They will if the leadership does.

96
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,210
而领导层会同意的
And the leadership will.

97
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,060
我还没断奶时这事就是两党的争议焦点
They fought us on this since I was in diapers.

98
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,420
假如我能说服我党同意提高退休年龄
Assuming that I can get this past my people and convince them,

99
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,410
你能说服你那边吗
can you convince yours?

100
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,620
这很困难
It's a tough sell.

101
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,200
你是参议院多数党领袖  赫克特
You're the Senate majority leader, Hector.

102
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,820
你不需要游说  可以直接命令
You don't have to sell. You can dictate.

103
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,290
你想要什么回报
What do you want in return?

104
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,530
一个正常运转的政府  避免开销冻结
A working government. We stave off the freeze.

105
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,840
你在《教育法案》上赢了
You won on education.

106
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,150
我们让你当上了副总统
We confirmed you as vice president.

107
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,740
共和党需要赢一次  弗兰克
The Republicans need a win, Frank.

108
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,310
我就是在提供赢的机会
And that's what I'm offering.

109
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,810
你们在福利改革上赢了
You get a win on entitlements.

110
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,730
我们避免了关门
We avoid a shutdown.

111
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,510
两党合作  双方都得分
Everyone gets points for bipartisanship.

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,870
你知道我担心谁
You know who I'm worried about.

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,170
柯蒂斯·哈斯
Curtis Haas.

114
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,700
他是个麻烦  弗兰克
He's a troublemaker, Frank.

115
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,260
还控制了你三分之一的党内成员
Who controls a third of your caucus.

116
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,980
他绝不会同意的
And he'll never go for this.

117
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,970
他就想看民主党不好过
He wants to see the Democrats suffer.

118
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,770
让他考虑一下
Just bring him to the table.

119
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,600
我只求这个
That's all I'm asking.

120
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,740
盖拉格小姐  我叫卢卡斯·古德温

我是《华盛顿先驱报》的副主编

123
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,070
只需要几分钟  我不求别的

124
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,330
如果我想跟你说话  就会回你的电话
If I wanted to talk to you, I would have returned your calls.

125

126
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,810
读了  所以我没联系你
Yes. Which is why I didn't call.

127
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,340
请给我个机会解释

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,840
弗兰克·安德伍德是幕后黑手

134
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,500
听着  这是一派胡言
Listen! This is nuts.

135
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,950
酒驾记录  听证会  所有都是...
The DUI. The brack hearing. All of it was part of --

136

你不能再这样了  好吗
This has to stop. Okay?

137

Whatever you think happened,

141
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,140
无论是什么让你这样跟踪我...
whatever compelled you to stalk me like this --

142
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,020
你是唯一可能知道点什么的人
You're the only person who might know something,

143
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,940
能理解得了的人
who could understand.

144
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,520
我没有别人可以说这事了
I've got -- I've got no one else I can talk --

145

149
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,670
守在楼外
Waiting outside of a building --

150
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,070
如果不是弗兰克·安德伍德  彼得可能还活着
Peter would still be alive if it wasn't for Frank Underwood.

151
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,950
我花了很大力气忘记彼得的事
I've worked really hard to put Peter behind me.

152
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,510
如果我再看到你  你再来找我
So if I see you again, if I hear from you again,

153
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,000
我不仅会报警
I'll not only contact the police,

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,960
还会让副总统知道你在对他说三道四
I'll let the vice president know what you're saying about him,

155
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,170
到时候你就等着特勤局找上门来吧
and then you can deal with the Secret Service, too.

156
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,580
都是正常的海外声音  中国那边有些杂音
It's the usual overseas chatter. Bit of a bum in China,

157
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,300
但我们觉得原因在贸易紧张
but we chalk that up to the trade tensions.

158
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,600
特勤局
Secret Service.

159
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,550
总统和副总统收到的死亡威胁数正常
Average number of death threats to both POTUS and the VP.

160
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,600
我们都交给了联调局的好伙伴们
We passed them along to our dear friends at the FBI.

161
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,260
联调局呢
FBI?

162
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,960
联调局向我们特勤局的
The FBI confirms the level of activity

163
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,290
好伙伴们确认了活动程度
of our dear friends at the Secret Service.

164
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,720
我们全部进行了追踪调查  没有高级别的威胁
We followed up on everything. No high-level threats.

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,320
我们没有需要直接
So nothing we need to report directly

166
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,810
向总统和副总统汇报的内容吗
to the president or vice president?

167
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,590
-没有  -谢谢  先生们
- No. - Thank you, gentlemen.

168
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,110
你发的邮件还有别人看过吗
The email you sent. Has anyone else seen it?

169
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,310
除了告知我的特工外  没有了
Except for the agent that alerted me, no.

170
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,880
其他机构可能会偶然看到
Other agencies might have stumbled upon this.

171
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,460
即使如此  他们大概也不会在意
Even so, they probably ignored it.

172
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,760
知道是谁发的帖子吗
Any idea who's making the posts?

173
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,970
暗网论坛
Deep Web forums.

174
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,460
几乎无法追踪  很可能就是一个人
Almost impossible to trace. Lone wolf most likely.

175
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,760
我要你找到这个人
I want you to find him.

176
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,900
得有对生命构成直接威胁的证据
We need a direct threat to life.

177
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,730
副总统刚刚上任
The vice president just assumed office.

178
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,580
这类阴谋论绝不能甚嚣尘上
I can't have this conspiracy stuff going mainstream.

179
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,870
-这类传言一般会渐渐平息  -我不能冒这个险
- This sort of thing usually fizzles out -- - I can't take the chance.

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,170
你去找到这个人  把他关起来
I want you to find him and put him away.

181
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,170
-他并没犯罪  -但他有这个倾向
- He hasn't committed a crime. - But he wants to.

182
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,100
那就来个推波助澜
So help him.

183
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,910
那要耗费人力
That requires manpower.

184
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,100
你手里有人
You've got men.

185
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,730
会暴露我的  道格
It exposes me, Doug.

186
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,830
我一直给你透露消息  因为你是老朋友了
I've always kept you informed because you're an old pal

187
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,180
我信任你  但...
and I trust you. But...

188
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,750
你这是要我展开正式行动
We're talking about an operation.

189
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,230
我是你在白宫工作的老朋友
I'm an old pal who now works at the White House.

190
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,860
老朋友之间说说
Between old pals,

191
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,990
我这个行政部门联络官已经当得太久了
I've been stuck as the executive liaison for way too long.

192
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:43,860
您是否担心
How worried are you

193
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,580
您所在社区的学校内会发生大规模枪击事件
that a mass shooting could happen in a school in your community?

194
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,950
非常担心  比较担心  不怎么担心
Great deal, somewhat, not so much,

195
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,850
完全不担心  还是不确定
not at all, unsure?

196
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,930
你的声音很性感嘛  人怎么样
You sound hot. Are you hot?

197
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,610
先生
Sir...

198
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,320
比较性感  非常性感
Somewhat hot? A great deal hot?

199
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,770
这里是林奇堡儿童医院小儿科
Lynchburg Children's, Pediatric Division.

200
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,770
我找谢莉尔·波斯纳
Can I talk to Cheryl Posner?

201
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,530
抱歉  她正在值班
Sorry. She's on duty right now.

202
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,330
我是她女儿
It's her daughter.

203
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,280
请稍候
Hold on one moment.

204
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,540
瑞秋  瑞秋吗
Rachel? Rachel?

205
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,640
甜心  你在听吗  请别...
Sweetheart, are you there? Please, do--

206
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,110
您好
Hello?

207
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,000
您好  杰伊先生
Hello, Mr. Jay.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,700
我叫瑞秋
My name is Rachel

209
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,680
代表全国枪支教育中心向您致电
and I'm calling on behalf of the National Firearm Education Center.

210
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,090
您能和我简单聊聊
Would you be able to speak with me briefly

211
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,450
您对枪支立法和第二修正案的看法吗
regarding firearm legislation and Second Amendment legislation?

212
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,270
你就是薇拉力荐的人
So, you're Willa's top choice.

213
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,220
那我丈夫和我为什么要选择你呢
Why should you be my husband's and my top choice?

214
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,400
在过去十年中
Over the past 10 years

215
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,740
关于你们夫妇的报道加起来还不到
the two of you combined have gotten less coverage

216
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,010
内布拉斯加州资浅众议员的平均水平
than the average junior congressman from Nebraska.

217
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,430
我们不想太受瞩目
Well, we don't seek the spotlight.

218
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,140
我不是说你们非要如此
I'm not suggesting you should.

219
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,840
但如果我没猜错
But am I correct in assuming

220
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,770
您丈夫会是一位行事积极的副总统
that your husband will be an active vice president?

221
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,000
想让媒体不去关注积极的副总统是比较难的
It's harder to keep an active VP out of the press than in it,

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,680
但我们可以让媒体刚好有些料可追
but it's possible if we give the media just enough

223
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,100
不至于什么都拿不到
to keep them from starving.

224
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,940
你在哪长大的  康纳
Where'd you grow up, Connor?

225
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,270
德州  和您一样
Texas. Just like you.

226
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,500
达拉斯吗
Dallas?

227
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,510
拉布克
Lubbock.

228
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,270
我想改口音可比你们难多了
I had a much thicker accent to get rid of you than y'all.

229
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,970
你怎么知道我有口音
How do you know I had one?

230
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,210
你俩第一次共同接受采访
Your first joint interview,

231
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,920
86年您丈夫竞选州议员时
when your husband was running for state assembly in '86.

232
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,780
网上有吗
That's on the internet?

233
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,920
没有  我联系了格林维尔当地的电视台
No. No. I contacted the local affiliate in Greenville.

234
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,340
他们不愿邮寄录像带
They wouldn't send me the tapes via mail,

235
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,020
我就亲自去资料库看了
so I went down there and watched in their vault.

236
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,490
跑到南卡罗莱纳吗
To South Carolina?

237
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,520
应聘就得做好准备工作
When I want a job, I do my homework.

238
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,500
很期待你的表现
I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

239
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,890
谢谢  安德伍德夫人
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.

240
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,630
周四见
Thursday.

241
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,520
这怎么能算胜利
I don't see how this is a victory for us.

242
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,210
我们要么面临开销冻结
Our choices are the freeze,

243
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,990
民主党会为这个饱受责难
which the Democrats get blamed for, or --

244
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,710
不一定  共和...
Not necessarily. The Republi--

245
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,120
我们也一样会受责难
No, which we definitely get blamed for.

246
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,730
-要么给他们  -福利改革吗  弗兰克
- Or we offer them -- - Entitlements, Frank?

247
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,660
我们已经表了态  不能回头了
We took a stand. We can't turn back now.

248
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,650
我宁可让政府停转
I'd rather see the government grind to a halt.

249
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,040
如果头条是
Think of the headline:

250
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,570
《民主党高层通过法案  避免开销冻结》
"Democrat Leadership Enacts Entitlement Reform, Staves Off Freeze."

251
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,260
这是团结和进步的表现
We show unity. We offer progress.

252
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,670
我们说服几个中坚保守派吧
Let's convert some lifelong conservatives.

253
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,800
门多萨答应合作了吗
You have Mendoza's assurance he'll work with us?

254
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,840
是的
I do.

255
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,450
我可不想把头伸出去
I don't want to put our necks out there

256
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,610
等人家落刀
just to have the guillotine fall.

257
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,080
不会的  我也会一起伸出去
You won't. My neck will be right out there with you.

258
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,350
弗兰西斯晕血
Francis faints at the sight of blood.

259
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,170
绝不会允许他们割伤他的皮肤
He'd never let them break the skin.

260
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,720
敬团结
To unity.

261
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,380
不不不  别这样
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

262
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,450
拉瑞  能来一趟吗
Larry, can you come by?

263
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,570
我电脑不知道怎么了
Something weird's going on with my computer.

264
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,650
谢谢
Thanks.

265
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,360
别这样
Come on!

266
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,950
怎么回事
Hey, what's the problem?

267
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,510
没事  我修好了
Nothing. It's fine. Uh, I fixed it.

268
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,800
好吧
Okay. Cool.

269
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,660
还不够革新
It's not as progressive as I'd like.

270
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,580
不够极端吧
You mean radical.

271
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,400
退休年龄升到67岁  2055年前政府都能负担福利
Raising retirement age to 67 makes entitlements solvent until 2055.

272
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,750
还能省一万亿
And it saves us over a trillion dollars

273
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,770
不花纳税人的钱
without a single penny of taxpayer income.

274
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,780
改到68岁能再省三千亿
68 would give us another 300 billion.

275
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,510
我还想禁止提前退休
And I'd like to eliminate early retirement.

276
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,260
完全禁止吗
Entirely?

277
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,230
不可能
Forget it.

278
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,550
68岁退  64岁早退呢
What about 68 and 64?

279
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,810
我要对选民负责
I have a responsibility to my constituents.

280
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,010
我承诺过某些问题绝不妥协
I promised I wouldn't waver when it comes to things --

281
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,820
难道要让茶党决定财政立法吗
Are we really going to allow the Tea Party to determine fiscal legislation?

282
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,820
{\an8}民共两党票数僵持时  茶党的倾向能决定局势

283
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,600
我从没指望他们帮忙
I've never been beholden to the Tea Party.

284
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,620
得了吧  柯蒂斯
Come on, Curtis.

285
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,690
没有茶党政治行动委员会
You wouldn't have won reelection

286
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,620
给你的一千万  你也赢不了重选
if their PACs hadn't dumped 10 million into your campaign.

287
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,820
如果他们对缩减开支的看法
If their definition of budgetary conservatism

288
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,210
与我不谋而合  那就正好...
happens to overlap with mine, that's a function--

289
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,270
柯蒂斯  柯蒂斯  友善一点
Curtis. Curtis. Let's show some goodwill.

290
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,650
68岁和64岁可以接受吗
Can you stomach 68 and 64?

291
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,810
马上生效吗
Effective immediately?

292
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,710
五年以后
Five years from now.

293
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,500
没兴趣
Not interested.

294
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,430
我们不能突然抛出这个提议
Well, you know we can't throw this on people without any warning.

295
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,130
得给他们时间消化
They need some time to digest.

296
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,080
对不起  就是不行
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

297
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,490
好吧  回去跟你们的幕僚和同事商量一下
Okay. Meet with your staff. Consult with your colleagues.

298
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,530
我也回去商量  明天再谈
I'll consult with mine. And let's talk tomorrow.

299
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,190
好吧  没问题
All right. I can agree to that.

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
这第一步很不错
But this is a good first step.

301
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,510
修正案通过后  法案进行表决时
How do we make sure Curtis can't filibuster

302
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,950
柯蒂斯阻挠议事怎么办
when we get the amendment passed?

303
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
如果能走到那步
Assuming we do.

304
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,850
只跟你说  我觉得我们可以改变他的想法
Between you and me, I'm sure we can turn him around.

305
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,710
我只是不想冒险
I just want to be on the safe side.

306
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,290
我们让修正案的表决
We make sure the passage of the amendment

307
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,860
成为法案表决的一部分
constitutes the passage of the bill.

308
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,840
事先约定
By previous agreement.

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,220
没错  修正案一通过
Yeah, that's right. We pass the amendment,

310
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,500
就完事了
and then we're done. Wham, bam.

311
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,930
能落到纸上吗
Can we put that in writing?

312
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,140
让艾瑞克森找我吧
Have Erikson reach out to me.

313
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,540
非常感谢
Muchos gracias.

314
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,890
慢用
There you go.

315
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,560
卢卡斯·古德温
Lucas Goodwin?

316
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,930
晚上好  卢卡斯
Good evening, Lucas.

317
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,780
对着麦克风说话
Speak into the microphone.

318
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,040
你是谁
Who are you?

319
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,540
返回主屏  打开另一个应用
Go to the home screen. Open the other app.

320
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,850
先告诉我你是谁
Tell me who you are.

321
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,390
你调查过我  想必已经知道我是谁了
You've done your research. You know who I am.

322
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,460
我怎么知道那是不是你的真实身份
I -- I know who you claim to be.

323
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,120
你要是现在还不相信我  那就不必谈了
And if you're not convinced by now, goodbye.

324
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,980
别别
Wait.

325
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,420
听你的  我返回主屏了
All right, I'm on the home screen.

326
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,280
打开验证程序
Open the notary app.

327
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,330
这是什么
What is this?

328
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,940
确保你不为执法部门工作
To ensure you aren't law enforcement.

329
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,250
我不是
I'm -- I'm not.

330
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,580
那就签了它
Then sign.

331
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
怎么签
How?

332
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,290
把你的拇指按在摄像头上  然后点"扫描"
Hold your thumb to the camera and press "Capture."

333
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,650
万一你是执法部门的呢
How do I know you're not law enforcement?

334
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,330
要么签了这文件  要么走人
Sign the document or walk away.

335
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,080
好了  我签好了
All right. I did it.

336
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,120
点"发送"
Press "Send."

337
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,660
发送到哪
Where is this going?

338
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,710
我用了伊朗和其他12个国家的代理
I'm VPNing through Iran and 12 other countries.

339
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,710
你不用担心  链接很安全
Don't worry. It's secure.

340
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,230
最后一件事
Now, one last thing.

341
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,540
我要《华盛顿先驱报》
I need the two-step verification code

342
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,740
内部服务器的两步验证码
for the Herald's internal servers.

343
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,830
我根本不知道该怎么做
I -- I don't -- I don't even know how to do that.

344
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,640
你当然知道  看你的邮箱
Yes, you do. Check your email.

345
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,950
把这平板毁了  尤其要把产品序列号抹干净
Destroy the iPad, especially the serial number

346
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,760
邮件记牢之后就删掉
and delete the email after you've memorized it.

347
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,380
祝你好运
Good luck.

348
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
还在吗
Hello?

349
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,910
雷蒙德  还在听吗
Raymond, are you there?

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,190
在
Yeah.

351
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,190
抱歉  弗兰克  我还以为看到了一只印加地鸠
Sorry, Frank. I -- I thought I saw an Inca dove.

352
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,570
肯定是冬迁飞错方向了
Must have flown the wrong direction for winter.

353
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,600
你那边好像风挺大  你在哪呢
It sounds windy. Where are you?

354
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,530
在我家楼顶  装了个野鸟喂食器
Top of my building. Got a bird feeder up here.

355
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,270
总统的工作做得不错  听说他同意了
Nice work with the President. I hear we have a green light.

356
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,540
他一开始也不愿意  但还是让步了
He pushed back in the beginning, but yeah.

357
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,560
他的写手正在改讲稿
His writers are reworking the speech now.

358
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,720
我这边也快成了  五年后  68退休  64早退
I'm very close to a deal.  68/64 in five years.

359
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,850
按说好的削减开支
Spending cuts as discussed.

360
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,860
说定了吗
Is that rock solid?

361
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,540
就差握手签字了
Soon as we shake hands.

362
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,250
那是谁在作梗
What's the hold-up?

363
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,340
柯蒂斯·哈斯  不过也在意料之中
Curtis Haas, which isn't a surprise.

364
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,080
我过会儿就和他见面  他是最后的障碍了
I'm meeting with him soon. He's the final hurdle.

365
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,680
时间掐得太正好了  弗兰克
Cutting it pretty close, Frank.

366
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,520
这可是历史性的时刻
Well, this is -- this is historic.

367
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,690
约翰逊当总统时共和党人就想推动福利改革了
The Republicans have wanted entitlement reform since Johnson.

368
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,360
柯蒂斯会同意的
Curtis will come around.

369
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,490
另外我们得在讲稿里提到延迟退休的事
In the meantime we should get the new retirement age into the speech.

370
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,530
我看还是别说得太详细  弗兰克
I would stay away from the specifics, Frank.

371
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,920
就算参议院通过了  众议院没准也...
I mean, I-- even if it passes, the House might--

372
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
我对众议院的了解
I know the House better

373
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,580
比你对鸟深入得多  雷蒙德
than you know birds, Raymond.

374
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,820
相信我  他们肯定会通过参议院的版本
Believe me when I say they'll pass the Senate version.

375
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,670
那我去跟总统说说
I'll talk to the President.

376
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,740
但这事绝不能有差错
Just make sure this is airtight.

377
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,960
多谢你  什么事
Thank you. What is it?

378
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,470
卢卡斯·古德温
Lucas Goodwin.

379
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,490
《先驱报》的那个
From the Herald.

380
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,160
他肯定在和佐伊一起调查
He must have been working with Zoe.

381
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,730
他知道多少
How much does he know?

382
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
不会比她多
No more than she did.

383
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,410
她知道的可不少
She knew enough.

384
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,560
我在办  先生
I'm on it, sir.

385
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,600
有证据吗
Proof?

386
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,750
还没有
Not yet.

387
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,230
怎么搞的  道格
Jesus, Doug.

388
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,520
局面在控制中  我只是想告诉你一声
It's under control. I just thought you should be aware.

389
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,710
我在跟总统  共和党和塔斯克周旋
I'm juggling the President, the Republicans, Tusk.

390
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,670
-我不能...  -你就继续忙你的
- I can't -- - And you should stay focused on that.

391
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,640
古德温交给我处理  你无须担心
Goodwin's on my plate. Not yours.

392
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,790
一直到20世纪
It wasn't until the 20th century

393
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,570
客观主义理念才成为主流观念
that the notion of noble objectivism came into the forefront.

394
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,100
但事实就是事实
But facts are facts.

395
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,290
1992年  事实  有人拿出一张
1992. Fact: George Bush, Sr.

396
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,200
老布什询问售货扫描机是如何工作的照片
is shown asking how a grocery scanner works,

397
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,040
进而攻击他无知
and he gets nailed for it.

398
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,860
真相是  他们向他展示的是一个新模型机
Fact? They were showing him a new model.

399
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,810
他只是在问新机器与旧机器的差别
He was asking how the new one was different than the old one.

400
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,250
好奇而已  并非无知
Curiosity, not ignorance.

401
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,420
但语境的缺失却传达了一个更有冲击力的观点
But the lack of context told a more powerful narrative.

402
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,050
在对事实的诸多整理中
There is no arrangement of facts

403
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,900
没有哪个是...完全客观的
that is, uh, purely objective.

404
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,460
我们总算可以做点什么了  终于有手段了
We can finally do something. We have the means to act.

405
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,300
哪个毛都没长全的少年黑客...
Some teenage pimple-faced hacker --

406
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,030
这是很高端的入侵
This was a sophisticated infiltration.

407
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,470
不是小孩子做得出来的
It's not the work of a child.

408
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,390
你看  邮件在这里
Look. Here's the email.

409
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,650
机器人希罗尼穆斯
Hieronymus Bot.

410
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,650
{\an8}希罗尼穆斯  古希腊史学家  以公正著名

411
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,710
联调局已经追捕他很多年了
The FBI's been hunting him for years.

412
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,430
卢卡斯  听我说
Lucas, listen to me --

413
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,400
如果我们拿到了通讯记录
If we get these records,

414
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,890
我需要你帮忙理顺时间先后
I'll need your help tracking timelines,

415
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,790
拼凑整件事的发展...
piecing together the chronology of the --

416
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,860
不  你只想找个人安慰你
No. You want somebody to hold your hand

417
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,380
告诉你  做这些无用功没什么不对
and say it's okay to go on this fucking goose chase.

418
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,350
你不该在伊萨卡教书  你的能力不止如此
You shouldn't be teaching in Ithaca. You're better than that.

419
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,190
-你该回华盛顿  -我就该待在这里
- You should be back home -- - I belong here.

420
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,190
对一群宿醉未消的英语专业大学生唠叨吗
Droning on to a bunch of hungover English majors?

421
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,920
没错
Exactly.

422
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,060
你对真相的看法是错的  客观事实是存在的
You're wrong about the truth. There is objective truth.

423
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,570
他杀了她
He killed her.

424
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,040
你知道这是事实
You know it's a fact.

425
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,030
事实就是
Here's a fact.

426
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,040
我妈最多只剩10到15年了
My mom has 10, 15 years left at best.

427
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,410
我毕业后加起来也没有上个月跟她相处时间久
I've seen her more in the past month than since I left for school.

428
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,130
这里更简单  也很安静
It's simpler here. It's quiet.

429
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,160
我需要这样的环境  她需要我
I need that. She needs me.

430
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,690
很抱歉  卢卡斯
I'm sorry, Lucas.

431
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,130
抱歉我那晚做出了那样的反应
I'm sorry that night how I reacted.

432
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,510
很遗憾你失去了你的女友
I'm sorry you lost your girlfriend.

433
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,100
很遗憾世界就是这么操蛋
I'm sorry the world is this fucked up.

434
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,500
我是真心的
I really am.

435
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,120
但我帮不了你
But I can't help you.

436
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,020
其他人在哪里
Where's everyone else?

437
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,220
我昨天给你帮了个倒忙
I did you a disservice yesterday.

438
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,860
不该在整个领导层面前让你为难
We shouldn't have put you on the spot in front of all the leadership.

439
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,180
请坐  柯蒂斯
Have a seat, Curtis.

440
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,170
我们知道你必须坚守立场
We know that you have an obligation to take a firm stance,

441
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,560
但承诺福利改革是你竞选的核心
but entitlement reform is something you ran on,

442
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,720
现在唾手可得了
and now it's within your grasp.

443
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,270
说说你的顾虑吧
So tell us your fears.

444
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,130
顾虑就是民主党又会赢一把
That the Democrats get another win.

445
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,490
我们在中期选举中失利
We suffer in the midterms,

446
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,470
下一届国会就会废除协议
and the next Congress dismantles the agreement.

447
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,180
你觉得我们在玩花招
You think we're being disingenuous.

448
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,630
我的选民不信任政府
My constituents don't trust the administration.

449
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,190
我不能让他们觉得我们受到了蒙骗
I can't have them thinking the wool's been pulled over our eyes.

450
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,750
如我所料  赫克特
As I suspected. Hector?

451
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,470
弗兰克和我建议
Frank and I propose this:

452
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,040
我们加入一项简单多数条款
We include a super majority point of order

453
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,140
十年内不再就这个问题进行新的立法讨论
against revisiting the issue for 10 years.

454
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,570
白纸黑字写下来
You have it in black and white.

455
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,970
达成一项长期的严肃承诺  不会被撤销
A serious, long-term commitment with no opportunity to dismantle.

456
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,280
这是加在其他要求之上
And that's on top of everything else we asked for.

457
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,580
退伍军人事务管理局和联邦救灾署的经费维持不变
VA services and FEMA stay at current levels.

458
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,210
其他机构的经费削减为你提议的80%到100%
Everything else at 80 to 100 percent of the cuts you propose.

459
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,550
你赢了  柯蒂斯
You get your win, Curtis.

460
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,890
我们只想避免灾难
We just avoid disaster.

461
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,240
也许国家应该见识一下灾难
Maybe the country needs to see what disaster looks like.

462
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,660
茶党的影响力很大  而你又为他们宣传
The Tea Party has a strong voice, and you're its bullhorn.

463
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,920
让你的选民看到  这份影响力能决定法律
Show your people that voice can translate into law

464
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,440
而不仅仅是激昂的口号
and not just add to the noise.

465
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,930
15年内不得重谈  10年不够
15 years before revisitation. Not 10.

466
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,260
可以
Okay.

467
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,360
如果我们通过法案后  众议院没有通过
And if the House fails to pass the bill after we do,

468
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,370
你得公开谴责是你们党造成了这种僵局
you go on record blaming your own party for the gridlock.

469
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,150
我们这就算达成协议了
I believe we have a deal.

470
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,570
你在听什么
What are you listening to?

471
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,010
抱歉  我关...
I'm sorry. I'll turn...

472
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,760
别  很好听  我能听吗
No, it's nice. Can I listen?

473
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,600
我的耳朵很干净  我保证
My ears are clean. I promise.

474
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,790
谢谢
Thanks.

475
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,720
-真美  -是啊
- It's beautiful. - Yeah.

476
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,230
好哀伤
It's so sad.

477
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,500
能让我放松
It helps me relax.

478
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,100
今天很辛苦吗
Long day?

479
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,290
我在呼叫中心上班
I work at a call center.

480
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,050
一小时打电话给两百个陌生人  是挺辛苦
So, yeah. 200 strangers an hour.

481
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,660
我就不打扰你了
I'll leave you alone.

482
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,810
你大概也不想再和陌生人聊天了
You probably don't want to talk to another one.

483
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,970
没关系  你不挂我电话就行
It -- it's all right. As long as you don't hang up on me.

484
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,070
你会和他们聊天吗  那些陌生人
Do you ever just talk to them? The strangers?

485
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,170
我们不允许
We're not allowed to.

486
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,970
换了我  肯定想问问他们是什么样
All I would want to do is ask them about who they are.

487
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,540
你呢  你做什么工作
What about you? What do you do?

488
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,460
我...在书店和托儿所上班
I, um, I work at the bookstore and the daycare center.

489
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,030
别人第一次给我宣传册时
I had that same look on my face the first time

490
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,060
我也是这个表情
somebody handed me one of those.

491
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,370
我只是...不信教
Yeah, I'm -- I'm just -- I'm not religious.

492
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,670
留着吧  看不看都无所谓
Just keep it. Check it out, or don't.

493
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,510
我们那儿有非常棒的音乐
We've got really good music there.

494
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,920
谢谢你
I'm -- thank you.

495
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,250
众议院向参议院提交了一份法案
The House sent a bill to the Senate.

496
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,910
和弗兰克想给众议院的那版完全不同
What Frank wants to send back bears zero resemblance.

497
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,960
因为那是两党联合的  不像我们的这份
Because it's bipartisan. Unlike ours.

498
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,620
听着像弗兰克的话
That sounds like something Frank would say.

499
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,690
我不是弗兰克
I'm not Frank.

500
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,400
他是你办公室的常客
He has a desk in your office.

501
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,940
如果法案在参议院通过
If this bill passes in the Senate --

502
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,150
不可能
It won't.

503
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,340
我们得有所准备  鲍勃
We should be prepared, Bob.

504
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,170
那我就拭目以待了
Well, I'm prepared to wait and see.

505
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,940
下午愉快  女士们
Have a good afternoon, ladies.

506
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,670
女士们
"Ladies"?

507
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,590
他受到了威胁
He's threatened.

508
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,640
蠢猪一个
He's a pig.

509
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,150
给他点时间
Give him time.

510
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,360
以前他身边有两个中年白人男子
He used to have two white middle-aged guys at his side.

511
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,200
现在他只能依靠一个黑人和一个小他20岁的女人
Now he's got a black guy and a woman 20 years his junior.

512
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,940
可这女人会开枪
Who knows how to shoot a rifle.

513
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,410
我们得继续劝他
We just need to keep at him.

514
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,970
什么事
Yes?

515
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,320
凯特琳娜·罗德里格斯在4号线
Catalina Rodriguez is on line four.

516
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,190
你先下去
Give me a moment.

517
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,260
凯特琳娜
Catalina.

518
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,930
泰德告诉我是你干的
Ted told me it was you.

519
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,560
你在听吗
You there?

520
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,310
是的  我在听
Yes, I'm here.

521
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,710
媒体对我们穷追不舍
The press won't leave us alone.

522
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,500
他们连续几周跑过来
For weeks they're showing up,

523
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,720
想拍到我和艾米莉的照片
trying to get pictures of me and Emily.

524
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,910
不是我泄的密
It wasn't me.

525
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,760
只有你知情
You're the only one who knew.

526
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,730
我不知道事情怎么会泄露
I do-- I don't know how the story got out.

527
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,440
泰德何必对我撒谎呢
Why would Ted lie abut that?

528
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,690
我不知道  也许他感到羞愧
I don't know. Maybe -- maybe he's ashamed.

529
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,080
那我该怎么办  他们什么时候才会放过我们
So what do I do? When will they leave us alone?

530
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,760
我也不知道  凯特琳娜
I -- I don't know, Catalina.

531
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,730
我受不了这样的生活
I can't live like this.

532
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,440
我很抱歉  我不知该说什么
I'm s-- I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

533
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,830
艾米莉还好吗
How -- how is Emily doing?

534
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,730
凯特琳娜
Catalina?

535
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,630
他自信满满
He's very confident.

536
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,520
但他有那个本事吗
Yeah, but does he have what it takes?

537
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,170
等他拿出媒体方案就知道了
We'll see when I get his media plan.

538
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,300
他个性如何
What about his personality?

539
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,690
迷人  直接  思维缜密
Charming. Direct. Very thorough.

540
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,470
他找到了86年我们第一次一起接受采访的录像
He found our first interview together, in '86.

541
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,270
我很想重温一下  他有副本吗
I would love to see that. Does he have a copy?

542
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,980
我想没有  电视台只允许他在台里看
I don't think so. The TV station made him watch it there.

543
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,550
我们该放给总统和第一夫人看
We should screen that for the president and the first lady.

544
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,980
让他们学学怎么接受采访
Show 'em how it's done.

545
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,150
克里斯蒂娜
Christina...

546
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,690
她怎么了
What about her?

547
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,080
你有没有注意到她和总统有什么不正常
Have you noticed anything strange between her and the president?

548
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,330
什么意思
How do you mean?

549
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,560
昨天我在走道里碰见他们
I passed them in the hall yesterday.

550
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,010
他们看上去  我说不好  很亲密
And they seem -- I don't know -- very intimate.

551
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,870
预备会议上他们是挺热络的
They did seem cozy at the prep session.

552
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,440
你觉得...
Do you think...?

553
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,260
不  不一定
No. Not necessarily.

554
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,720
不过这想法挺有意思
An interesting thought, though.

555
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,960
抱歉打扰  先生
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

556
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,020
我们在吃午饭
We're having lunch.

557
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,410
共和党人变卦了
The Republicans are backing out.

558
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,250
门多萨的幕僚长给我提了醒
Mendoza's chief of staff just gave me the heads-up.

559
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,660
马上帮我接门多萨
Get Mendoza on the phone.

560
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,410
是柯蒂斯·哈斯  他临阵退缩了
It's Curtis Haas. He got cold feet.

561
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,770
笼子  差不多像那样  不过
Cages. It's really kinda like but,

562
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,340
但大家会看  挺逗的
you know, people look at 'em. It's kind of fun.

563
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,050
我收到你邮件了
I got your email.

564
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,000
你现在有空吗
Now good for you?

565
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,480
当然  我过会儿打给你
Yeah, sure. Can I call you right back?

566
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,550
你究竟想问什么
What exactly did you need to know?

567
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,250
我们在做网络战的后续报道
We're doing some follow-up pieces on the cyber warfare thing.

568
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,230
我就想问问内行人知不知道
I just wanted to get a layman's understanding

569
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,010
中国人会如何越过防火墙
of how the Chinese might get through a firewall.

570
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,470
挺复杂的  不过我可以演示下基本原理
It's a bit complicated, but I could show you the basics.

571
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,840
那足够了
That's all I need.

572
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,020
我们使用的是标准多层体系结构
We use a standard N-tier architecture.

573
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,680
就像多层面包做成的大三明治
Think of it like a big sandwich with layers of bread.

574
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,000
每层之间夹着生菜  番茄  烤牛肉之类的
Between each is the lettuce, the tomato, the roast beef, whatever.

575
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,410
我现在输入的是组织代码
What I'm pulling up here is the org code,

576
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,160
隔离了数据库
which, uh, separates the database --

577
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,720
该死  我忘了马上要和销售部门开会
Shit. I forgot there's a meeting with sales in a couple minutes.

578
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,720
你想晚点继续吗
You want to do this later?

579
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,890
不用  我现在跑过去 
No. I'll just run over

580
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,000
跟他们说我要晚几分钟到  马上回来
and let them know I'll be a few minutes late. Be right back.

581
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,440
好  我就在这儿
Cool. I'll be here.

582
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,200
好的
Okay.

583
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,350
快点快点
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

584
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,170
来了
There.

585
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,700
快回复啊
Come on.

586
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,040
好
Okay.

587
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,460
好嘞
Go.

588
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,960
出什么事了
Something wrong?

589
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,580
我找不着手机了  真奇怪
Can't find my phone. It -- it's weird.

590
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,110
刚刚还在的
I had it just a minute ago.

591
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,170
找到了  不好意思
Here it is. Sorry about that.

592
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,240
没事
No problem.

593
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,210
那个多层体系结构
So the, uh, N-tier architecture.

594
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,600
我刚说的那个高科技三明治
The high-tech sandwich I was talking about.

595
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,710
我以为门多萨愿意合作
I thought Mendoza was willing to work with us.

596
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,130
他是愿意  问题在柯蒂斯·哈斯
He is. The problem is Curtis Haas.

597
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,210
你跟他谈过了吗
And have you spoken with him?

598
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,280
他办公室不回我们电话
His office isn't returning our calls.

599
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,220
门多萨也是
Neither is Mendoza's --

600
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,580
我不该让步的
I should've stuck to my guns.

601
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,630
明天下午才开始投票
The vote isn't until tomorrow afternoon.

602
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,160
我一早就会联系门多萨
I'll reach out to Mendoza first thing in the --

603
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,330
这可是国情咨文  弗兰克
This is the State of the Union, Frank.

604
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,450
我不能陷入尴尬境地
I won't be left in limbo.

605
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,620
如果我们得重写演讲
If we need to start rewriting that speech now,

606
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,140
我一分钟也不想耽误
I don't want to waste a minute.

607
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,360
我能扭转局面  先生
I can turn this around, sir.

608
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,050
雷蒙德告诉我这是你的点子
You know, Raymond told me this was your idea.

609
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,860
做出妥协
To pursue this compromise.

610
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,010
只是提出建议
I suggested it as an option.

611
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,630
他说是你逼他蹚这浑水的
He said you bullied him into it,

612
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,030
他认为这是个错误的决定
that he thought it was a -- a mistake.

613
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,740
如果他这么反对  他就应该劝阻你
If he felt so strongly, he should have advised you otherwise.

614
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,270
雷蒙德不是政客
Raymond is not a politician.

615
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,260
他依赖于我们的政治意见
He relies on our political expertise

616
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,330
正如我们依靠他的商业头脑
as much as we rely on his business acumen.

617
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,120
或许我们应该到真出现问题再相互指责
Maybe we shouldn't point fingers until there's a problem.

618
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,550
你管这不叫问题
Oh, you wouldn't call this a problem.

619
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,030
在成为问题之前解决掉就不是问题
Not if it's solved before it becomes one.

620
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,020
我要的是个能管理好国会的副总统
You see, I wanted a Vice President who can manage Congress.

621
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,210
而不是个不自量力的人
Not one who bites off more than he can chew.

622
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,430
那就相信您做出了正确的决定  先生
Then have faith you made the right choice, sir.

623
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,220
我的信念正在迅速地消失殆尽
Whatever faith I have is quickly evaporating.

624
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,280
别给政府丢脸  弗兰克
Don't humiliate the administration, Frank.

625
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,170
你也是其中一员了
You're part of it now.

626
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,430
是  先生
Yes, sir.

627
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,780
我们谈完了
We're done.

628
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,950
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

629
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,430
帮我接内线
Give me the private line, please.

630
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,110
塔斯克挡我道  古德温对我穷追不舍
Tusk is blocking my way. Goodwin at my heels.

631
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,110
现在一步也不能错
There can be no false steps now.

632
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,170
越往上爬  尔虞我诈越多
The higher up the mountain, the more treacherous the path.

633
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,400
卢卡斯·古德温去找她了
Lucas Goodwin went up to visit her.

634
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,580
他们可能也会来找你
They may be looking for you.

635
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,320
没人找过我  应该没人知道我在这儿
Nobody's contacted me. I don't think anyone knows I'm here.

636
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,270
那我们要确保你不会被人发现
Then we need to make sure it stays that way.

637
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,440
避免不必要的交谈
Don't speak to anyone you don't have to.

638
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,150
不要去不必要的地方
Don't go anywhere you don't need to be.

639
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,020
告诉我你听到我说的了
Tell me you heard what I said.

640
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,710
听到了  我知道了
I heard you. I get it.

641
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,340
我没事
I'm fine.

642
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,820
-敷点冰  -我说了我没事
- Put some ice on it. - I said it's okay.

643
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,200
这是什么
What is this?

644
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,150
你现在还翻我的垃圾吗
What, are you going through my garbage now?

645
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,220
在公交上别人给我的
Someone gave it to me on the bus.

646
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,860
有人联系你  就来告诉我
You let me know if anyone contacts you.

647
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,690
抱歉我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

648
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,690
没事
No worries.

649
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,640
现在你要纹多少
How much more you want to do right now?

650
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,820
填满这一块吗
Fill in this area?

651
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,400
嗯  然后下面再多加一个罂粟
Yeah. And, uh, one more poppy down here.

652
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,550
一次做这么多啊
That's a lot for one sitting.

653
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,660
我知道
I know.

654
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,180
好吧
Okay.

655
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,770
弗兰西斯
Francis?

656
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,050
这就走吗
You're heading in?

657
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,250
门多萨起的早
Mendoza's an early riser.

658
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,940
你会解决好的
You'll figure this out.

659
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,350
我得证明副总统不是吃素的
I need to prove what the Vice President is capable of.

660
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,070
别向他们证明  向我证明
Don't prove it to them. Prove it to me.

661
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,960
柯蒂斯抓着我的要害  弗兰克
Curtis has me by the tea bags, Frank.

662
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,440
没他我的党派就要乱套
I don't have a working majority without him.

663
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,090
可他不是多数党领袖
He wasn't elected leader.

664
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,100
是没错  但我也得选边站
True. But I have to pick my battles.

665
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,950
你要是在预算问题上无法控制他
If you can't control him on budgetary issues --

666
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,950
不光是他  还有听命于他的15个参议员
It's not just him. It's the 15 senators he has under his thumb.

667
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,800
没他们支持我就不能连任
I won't be the leader next year if they turn on me.

668
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,620
他想我们求他  把他找来
So he wants to be courted. Sit him down --

669
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,680
我试过和他谈了  但他不肯让步
I already tried talking to him. He wouldn't budge.

670
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,800
那我们一起去跟他谈
Then we'll both talk to him.

671
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,870
他已经表明立场了
He's made his position clear.

672
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,060
我们都在这张桌子旁握手了
We all shook hands at this table.

673
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,540
我最多只能保证限制替代修正案
The most I can do is put the substitute amendment

674
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,280
表决前的辩论
on the floor with limited debate.

675
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,940
你们那边公开怎么说随你们便
Now, your people can say whatever they want for the record.

676
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,620
但我们会投票否决修正案
But we're gonna vote the amendment down.

677
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,790
我对象征性姿态不敢兴趣
I am not interested in symbolic gestures.

678
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,950
我只能做到这样
That's all I can offer.

679
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,290
你的勇气哪去了
Where's your courage?

680
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,850
我权力有限  弗兰克
My power has limits, Frank.

681
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,940
再有五个共和党人  你那票就定胜负了
Five Republicans makes you the deciding vote.

682
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,940
{\an8}参议院投票打平时  作为参议院主席的副总统才能投出决定票

683
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,380
现在很难说
Now, it's highly doubtful

684
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,910
我们能不能让他们违反党派意志投票
we can get them to vote against their own party.

685
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,490
但他们可以弃权
But they might abstain.

686
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,330
那需要10人弃权
You'd need 10.

687
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,160
福利改革是共和党人的长期追求
Entitlement is the Republicans' white whale.

688
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,760
我至少能说通两个人
I can get at least two of 'em to flip.

689
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,500
那就只需要六票弃权
And you'd only need six abstaining.

690
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,810
艾瑞克森已经在打电话了
Erikson's already making calls.

691
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,560
唐纳
Donner?

692
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,290
还有普拉斯科
And Pulaski.

693
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,510
给我一份名单  我跟他一起上阵
All right. Get me a call list so I can tag-team with him.

694
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,540
在这儿
Got it right here.

695
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,820
我们得使狠招
We have to get medieval.

696
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,180
要说议院程序
When it comes to parliamentary procedure,

697
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,690
没有哪条规定我不知道  先生
there's not a rule I don't know, sir.

698
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,420
给我找到能钻空子的
Find me the ones we can bend.

699
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,710
马克  你是个明白人
Mark, you're a sensible man.

700
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:21,080
是  我知道  我懂
Yes, I -- I know -- I understand.

701
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,910
如果  跟你说
What if -- tell you what.

702
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,590
如果你选区内的两家退伍军人医院  对  两家
What if both VA hospitals in your district -- yes, both of them.

703
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,040
别挂  谁
Hold on. Who?

704
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,660
莫里亚蒂
Moriarty.

705
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,190
我答应给他的牲牛研究中心拨款
I promised him an amendment for his bovine research center.

706
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,010
这就有六票了
That makes six.

707
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,310
马克  如果我能给两家医院提供资金
Mark, if I can get you funding for both,

708
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,810
你愿跟我们合作吗
are you with us?

709
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,150
非常好
Excellent.

710
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,980
你这几天来白宫
You come by the White House

711
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,800
跟我共进午餐吧
and have lunch with me sometime soon.

712
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,900
再见  数目够了
Bye-bye. We have the numbers.

713
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,420
你打断点名之后
Once you break the quorum call

714
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,520
会有些麻烦
it's gonna be a little tricky.

715
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,660
我们路上说
Tell me on the way.

716
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,530
先生  先生
Sir. Sir.

717
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,990
-我们票数可能不占多数  -什么
- We might not have a majority. - What?

718
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,990
民主党在挖墙脚
The Dems are poaching people.

719
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,590
唐纳  普拉斯基  可能还有别人
Donner, Pulaski. Maybe more.

720
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,780
投票通过修正案吗
Voting for the amendment?

721
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,410
部分支持  其余弃权  我还在查是谁
Some. Others abstaining. I'm still trying to figure out who.

722
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,460
我们得推迟  弄清到底是怎么回事
We need to delay and figure out what the fuck's going on.

723
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:07,260
点名  离休会还有49小时
Quorum call. There's 49 hours until the recess.

724
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,150
一小时叫一个人来
We call a name an hour.

725
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,710

727
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,630
抱歉  你坐了我的位置
Excuse me. I do believe you're sitting in my chair.

728
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,920
德鲁里先生  现在进行到哪里了
Mr. Drewry, what is the order of business.

729
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,800
我们正在点名  先生
We are in a quorum call, sir.

730
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,600
那你怎么不点名呢
Then why aren't you calling the roll?

731
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,210
在点名  先生  不着急
We are, sir. In a deliberate manner.

732
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,650
速度快点吧
Let's speed it up.

733
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,120
布朗先生
Mr. Brown?

734
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,140
到
Here.

735
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,760
动作再快点
More expeditious than that.

736
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,990
-博尔先生  -到
- Mr. Burr? - Here.

737
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,380
-坎特维尔女士  -到

738
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,290
西里尼先生
Mr. Cerini?

739
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,940
到
Check.

740
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,860
康维尔
Cornwall?

741
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,410
到
Here.

742
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,150
科森先生
Mr. Colson?

共和党参议员柯蒂斯·哈斯

774

778
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,800
但是

779
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,930
现在想躲避媒体更难了
It'll be even harder to stay out of the news now.

780
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,210
那为什么还要一起接受采访
Then why the joint interview?

781
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,190
我又看了一遍南卡罗来纳的采访

我猜你可能想留一份
I thought you might want it.

785
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,830
采访中有一个瞬间  你用手帮他捋头发

786
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,620
非常亲密  非常有人情味
It's intimate and human.

787
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,630
单是那一个瞬间就足以让我为你丈夫投票
That moment alone would've made me want to vote for your husband.

788
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,670
像这样的小事  能给你几个月的清净
Something like that will buy you months of flying beneath the radar.

789
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,810
你想让谁来进行采访
And who do you have in mind to conduct the interview?

790

791
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,660
这代表你还没出局
It means you still haven't been ruled out.

792
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,640
我就当是有进步了
Well, I'll consider that progress.

793
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,660
这里是民主党议员的衣帽间  赫克特
This is the Democratic cloak room, Hector.

794
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,010
你们的在另一边
Yours is on the other side.

795
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,680
你的诡计不会成功的
What you're doing won't work.

796
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,670
有可能会  所以你大老远地跑过来了
It might. Which is why you made the long walk over here.

797
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,180
冰水
Ice water?

798
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,750
我的人正坐着各种交通工具赶过来
I have my people in planes, trains, and automobiles.

799
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,130
我只需要六票达到法定人数
All I need is six to make my quorum.

800
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,090
想想我有26票能干什么
Think what I can do with 26 votes.

801
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,870
现在我都有45票了
And I've got 45.

802
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,890
你的人再怎么赶也没这么快吧
You won't be able to get your planes and trains back here fast enough.

803
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,970
我愿赌一把
I'll roll those dice.

804
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,170
会议警卫官的工作做得非常好
The sergeant at arms is very good at his job.

805
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,550
这样正可以让柯蒂斯明白  究竟谁是老大
And this is a perfect way to show Curtis who's in charge.

806
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,450
我这是在帮你  赫克特
I'm doing you a favor, Hector.

告诉我你想要什么
Tell me what you want.

808

我一直想要的东西  我们达成的协议
What I've always wanted. The package we shook hands on.

809
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,130
然后我就把参议院还给你
Then I'll give you your Senate back.

810
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,880
他们不能自愿回来吗
They can't come back voluntarily.

811
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,550
选六个演技最好的出来
Pick your six best actors.

812
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,160
我们不能妥协  赫克特
We can't give in, Hector.

813
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,160
如果你按党派路线走  我们就不会落到这个境地
We wouldn't be in this situation had you towed the party line.

你通过修正案吧  我会阻挠主法案的通过
You can pass the amendment. I'll just filibuster the main bill.

823

这我并不知情
I wasn't informed of that.

830
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,590
要多留意小字附条款  柯蒂斯
Pay attention to the fine print, Curtis.

831
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,450
这比协议本身重要的多
It's far more important than the selling price.

你现在或曾经在
Are you currently or have you ever been a member

899
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,360
执法机构工作过吗
of any law enforcement agency?

900
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,710
我已经告诉过你我没有了
I already told you I wasn't.

901
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,360
两步验证

不  我没有  以前也没有

903

那你现在或曾经向执法机构
Are you currently or have you ever been

904
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,100
提供过情报吗
an informant for law enforcement?

905
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,170
没有
No.

906
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,260
你觉得自己被跟踪了吗
You think you might have been followed?

907
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,620
过去几周发生过什么奇怪的事吗
Anything strange the past few weeks?

908
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,480
这个...你知道吗
Th-- this is -- you know what?

909
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,330
这让我很不舒服
This is making me feel uncomfortable --

910
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,910
我们不是闹着玩的
We're not fucking around here.

911
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,330
如果你认为联调局没查过你的邮件
If you think the FBI hasn't been tracking your posts,

912
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,660
那你就太天真了
then you're naive.

913
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,340
你觉得他们知道我的身份吗
You think they know who I am?

914
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,630
不知道  你隐藏得很好
No. You hid yourself well.

915
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,990
你要对《先驱报》做什么
What are you going to do with the Herald.

916
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,860
不做什么
Nothing.

917
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,300
那你为什么想要访问权限
Then why did you want access?

918
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,490
我已经有访问权限了
I already had access.

919
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,370
我就是这样联系你的
It's how I contacted you in the first place.

920
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:54,800
只是想知道你是不是来真的
Just needed to know if you were serious.

921
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,580
那是腰果
That's Cashew.

922
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,100
你为什么要联系我
Why did you contact me?

923
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,200
因为你走投无路了
Because you're desperate.

924
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,650
而且我不喜欢当权者
And I'm not fond of authority.

925
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,790
今天  在安德伍德副总统的主持下
Just today, under the leadership of Vice President Underwood,

926
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,420
参议院通过了HR 934号法案
the Senate passed HR 934,

927
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,400
同时通过了一个历史性的福利改革修正案
along with an historic entitlement reform amendment.

928
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,090
通过将正常退休和提早退休的年龄
By raising the retirement age to 68 and 65

929
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,800
分别提高到68和65岁
for normal and early retirement, respectively,

930
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,940
我们将确保未来几代人的福利得到保障
we will ensure entitlements for generations to come.

931
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,290
几周后  等众议院通过这项法案
And when the House passes that bill in a few weeks,

932
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,190
对此我完全有信心
as I fully expect it to do,

933
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,250
我们就能结束政府的开销冻结
we will put the government freeze to rest.

934
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,280
我们将继续为我们的国家服务
We will continue the business of serving our country,

935
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,170
而不是让国家瘫痪
rather than paralyzing it.

936
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,090
这是美国人民应得的
The American people deserve no less.

937
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,720
我们站在民主的圣坛上
We stand at the altar of democracy.

938
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,780
让我们站在一起
Let us stand together.

939
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,640
我跟杰姬谈过  我会在众议院支持你
I spoke to Jackie. You have my support in the House.

940
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,860
但现在众议院还没通过呢
But it hasn't passed the House yet.

941
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,460
在交给总统前  还长路漫漫
There's a long march before it arrives on the president's desk.

942
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,240
至于我  我以前总在镜头边缘
As for me, I used to be on the edge of the frame.

943
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,100
现在只有三英尺远了
Now I'm only three feet away.

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}一个议案先在参议院表决  然后在众议院表决
众议院表决时  可以自己起草一个版本
也可以直接拿参议院的版本进行投票
本集中弗兰克想让众议院直接拿参议院通过的版本进行表决
这样更高效  如果有两个版本
双方还得把两个版本综合在一起
各自再投票一次  然后才能给总统签字  生效成为法律

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国宪法规定副总统是参议院的主席
但是平时副总统不干预参议院事务
只有在投票出现平局或大的会议时才出席
而本集中弗兰克打破了常规  利用规则主持参议院投票
所以才会对多数党领袖说"把参议院还给你"

鼓动同僚反对奥巴马医保法案
要求国会预算法案同医保法案落实挂钩
9月24日至25日  泰德·科鲁兹连续在参议院发言21小时19分钟
为茶党造出极大声势
由于科鲁兹等国会两院中的茶党成员在预算问题上坚持强硬立场
而总统奥巴马为了搞臭共和党的名声也拒绝谈判
美国联邦政府于10月1日被迫"停摆"  关张大吉
停摆持续了16天  两党在声望均遭到极大打击的情况下
不得不坐在一起  达成预算协议
