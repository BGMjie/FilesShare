当美国舰队与中国对峙时
a man who has his finger on the button

36

他可以随时批准实施打击
while U.S. Ships are squaring off with China --

37
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,770
还授意他的白宫顾问去干预...
but then instructed his White House counsel to coach a --

38
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,610
据称  先生  没有被证实
Allegedly, sir. Not proven.

39
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,920
去干预证人  他的做法
To coach a witness. Which is behavior either resulting

40
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
要么是受药物影响  要么更糟
from the use of those drugs, or worse,

41
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,770
是有意想践踏法律
a deliberate attempt to obstruct the law.

42
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,740
你不觉得两种情况都该被弹劾吗
Now wouldn't you call either scenario impeachable?

43
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,310
那该由国会决定  先生  而不是我
That's for the United States Congress to decide, sir. Not me.

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,340
你知道总统在服用任何药物吗
Were you aware that the president was taking any form of medication?

不  我不知道
No, I was not.

46
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,710
你注意到他举止古怪吗
Did you notice him acting in a bizarre fashion?

47
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,910
-情绪不稳  语无伦次  -没有  先生
- Unstable, incoherent? - No, sir.

48
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,250
-有任何奇怪的行为吗  -没有  先生
- Any odd behavior? - No, sir.

在贸易战之际解雇幕僚长不算吗
Not even firing his chief of staff in the midst of a trade war?

他没有解雇我  是我主动辞职的
He didn't fire me. I resigned.

51
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,500
你能告诉我们为什么吗
Would you tell us why?

52
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,390
我辞职是因为我觉得自己无法
I resigned because I felt I could no longer

53
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,780
再以最好的状态为总统服务
serve the president to the best of my ability.

54
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,730
发生了什么变化  是什么让你得出那样的结论
And what changed? How did you come to that conclusion?

55
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,240
我与白宫中的某些人
I had some fundamental differences of opinion

56
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,310
基本理念不合
with certain people in the White House.

57
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,630
比如谁  总统吗
Like who? The president?

58
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,000
不  先生
No, sir.

59
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,580
那某些人是指谁
Well, what certain people then?

60
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,610
实际上只有一个人
One person, actually.

61
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,040
副总统  弗兰克·安德伍德
The vice president, Frank Underwood.

62
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,730
他想让你离开吗
He wanted you gone?

63
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,950
我不敢说副总统想怎么样  不想怎么样
I can't speak as to what the vice president did or didn't want.

64
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,760
他想要隐藏什么吗
Was he trying to hide anything?

65
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,430
他是不是怕你曝光什么
Was he afraid you might expose something?

66
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,890
那你得去问他  先生
You'd have to ask him, sir.

67
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,110
司法委员会正在上演的是一出闹剧
What's happening in the Judiciary Committee is a farce.

68
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,840
共和党正在利用这种...
The Republicans are exploiting the situ--

69
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,890
插一句  副总统先生
Excuse me, Mr. Vice President,

70
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,020
不仅仅是共和党
but it's not just Republicans.

71
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,460
不少民主党人也站出来说
A number of Democrats have come out saying

72
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,470
他们支持弹劾
they would support impeachment.

73
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,750
包括多数党党鞭  杰姬·夏普
Including the Majority Whip, Jackie Sharp.

74
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,200
这令人发指
Which is egregious,

75
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,410
因为委员会还在进行听证
since the committee hasn't stopped hearing testimony,

76
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,480
特别检察官也没有完成调查
and nor has the special prosecutor completed her investigation.

77
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,720
你极力维护总统
You vigorously defend the president,

78
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
但有报道称你们已经闹僵
but there are reports that you've had a falling out.

79
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,610
你们好几个星期没说过话了
That you haven't spoken in weeks.

80
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,090
一派胡言
That is simply not true.

81
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,660
我与白宫的高级官员通过话
I've spoken to senior staff at the White House

82
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,000
他说总统担心你会在2016年大选中与他竞争
who say the president is worried you want to run against him in 2016.

83
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,610
而就在今天  琳达·瓦斯奎兹暗指你...
And just today Linda Vasquez intimated that you --

84
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,940
我相信总统一定会在2016年竞选连任
Look, I fully expect that the president will run in 2016,

85
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,100
而且我希望他能够慷慨地邀请我
and I hope he's generous enough to invite me

86
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,390
作他的竞选伙伴
to be his running mate.

87
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,050
弹劾  定罪  如果是这个结果呢
Impeachment, conviction. Let's say it happens.

88
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,020
不会的  他完全是无辜的
It won't. He's completely innocent.

89
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,140
我们假设一下  你成了总统
Let's say it does happen. You become president.

90
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,050
我不会去想象那个情形
That is not a scenario I'm going to entertain.

91
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,290
但你脑中肯定有过这个想法
But the thought must have crossed your mind.

92
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,790
而且可以说  如果不是因为你
And one could make the argument that the president

93
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,950
总统也不会陷入这样的窘境
wouldn't be in this predicament if it weren't for you.

94
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,950
是你的幕僚长与冯和拉尼根的牵连
It's your staff's involvement with Feng and Lanagin

95
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,110
才引发了邓巴的调查
that expanded Dunbar's investigation,

96
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,390
-随之发现了出行记录  -这些弹劾听证
- which resulted in the travel logs - Look, these impeachment hearings

97
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,340
是政治操纵的结果
are the result of political maneuvering,

98
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,260
-而不是  -是你在操纵还是共和党
- not the fact that-- - Your maneuverings, or the Republicans?

99
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,010
莫里  我一直很喜欢你  你的问题很尖锐
Morley, I've always liked you. You ask the tough questions.

100
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,370
你当然可以质疑我的判断
And you can certainly question my judgment.

101
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,880
但不要质疑我的爱国心
But do not question my patriotism.

102
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,830
我为国家和总统服务  而不是我自己
I serve this nation and my president, not myself.

103
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,040
他满口谎言
He's lying through his teeth.

104
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,970
我们所做的已经见效了
What we're doing is working.

105
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,100
让大家一直私下谈论
We keep the whisper campaign alive.

106
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,760
我们让他显得渴望权利  显得奸诈
We spin him as power-hungry, as duplicitous.

107
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,510
将焦点集中在他身上  而不是您
Focus attention on him. Not you.

108
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,190
最新支持率是多少  20%吗
What's the latest? 20%?

109
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,530
佐格比的数据是24%  您的讲话起了作用
Zogby has you at 24. Your speech made a difference.

110
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,270
支持率正在上升
The approval numbers are moving in the right direction.

111
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,360
我们不能再这么小打小闹了
We need to do more than play the spin game.

112
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,460
我们要打垮弗兰克  让他而不是我去当牺牲品
We need to destroy Frank. Offer his head instead of mine.

113
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,980
-我们利用雷蒙德·塔斯克  -怎么利用
- We use Raymond Tusk. - How?

114
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,460
在他的听证会上  在他去司法委员会时
At his hearing. When he goes to the Judiciary.

115
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,940
先生  您已经被指控干预一个证人了
Sir, you're already being accused of coaching one witness.

116
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,750
如果您再干预另一...
If you take steps to coach anoth--

117
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,720
不是干预  是让他说出事实
Not coaching. The truth.

118
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,960
雷蒙德承认洗钱
Raymond admits to the money laundering,

119
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,260
把弗兰克推到风口浪尖  说我什么都不知道
puts Frank at the center of this, and says I knew nothing.

120
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,940
之后我们会回报他的诚实
And then we'll reward him for his honesty.

121
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,710
您是说特赦吗
You mean a pardon.

122
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,450
我想让你跟他去谈
I want you to talk to him.

123
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,180
让我自己陷于危险之中吗
And put myself at risk?

124
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,580
你现在不在政府供职了
Well, you're not part of this administration anymore.

125
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,900
没有法律规定你不能去拜访雷蒙德·塔斯克
There's no law that says you can't pay Raymond Tusk a visit.

126
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,560
作为回报  辞职也不非得永久有效  琳达
And in return, resignations don't have to last forever, Linda.

127
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,670
如果我这么做  您得和我保持距离  越远越好
If I do this, you have to be a million miles away.

128
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,050
特莉莎和我会去戴维营
Tricia and I'll go to Camp David.

129
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,640
不算特别远  但也够了
It's not a million miles away, but it'll do the job.

130
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,500
我可以对琳达下手  调查她的过去
I can go after Linda. Dig into her past --

131
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,140
搞定她解决不了大问题
Neutralizing her won't neutralize the bigger problem.

132
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,580
是总统想要我的命
It's the president that's after blood.

133
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,600
那他打算怎么做
Then what's his move?

134
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,580
他不能要求我辞职  只能把我挤走
He can't ask me to resign. He'd have to force me out.

135
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,530
要挤走我的话  如果我是他
And to do that, if I were him,

136
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,630
肯定会回去找最初成就我的人
I would return to the hand that first fed me.

137
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,900
-雷蒙德·塔斯克吗  -没错
- Raymond Tusk? - Exactly.

138
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,220
不会  他要是把你卷进去  他自己也难保
No, he'd have to implicate himself to implicate you.

139
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,280
除非他能得到赦免
Not if he gets a pardon.

140
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,390
这是唯一只有总统才能开出的条件
It's the one thing that only a president can offer.

141
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,140
塔斯克是个手榴弹  如果他赦免了他...
Tusk is a hand grenade. If he pardons him --

142
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,030
没错  塔斯克是个手榴弹
You're right. Tusk is a hand grenade,

143
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,200
我们得拽下保险栓  朝沃克扔过去
and we need to pull the pin and throw him at Walker

144
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,830
否则就是沃克拽下保险栓  扔向我们了
before Walker pulls the pin and throws him at us.

145
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,950
我得和雷蒙德见面  一对一
I want to meet with Raymond, one on one.

146
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,510
我代表你去谈吧
Let me speak on your behalf.

147
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,090
-这样的话  如果有人发现  -我了解雷蒙德
- That way if anyone finds -- -I know Raymond.

148
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,220
他只会对我做出回应
He won't respond to anyone but me.

149
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,460
他的听证会安排在什么时候
When's his hearing scheduled?

150
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,670
后天下午两点
Uh, day after tomorrow. Two p.m.

151
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,490
-那我们还有40个小时行动  -是  先生
- That gives us 40 hours to make it happen. - Yes, sir.

152
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,280
可能是我的手机
I think it's mine.

153
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,790
赛斯  现在可是凌晨四点
Seth, it's four in the morning.

154
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,210
什么时候
When?

155
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,640
我希望你跟她一起去
I want you to go with her.

156
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,110
-我这就去征求洛克兰的批准  -谢谢
- I'll get it cleared with Rockland right now. -Thank you.

157
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,390
密查姆说飞机30分钟内就能准备好
Meechum says the plane will be ready in 30 minutes.

158
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,580
行  好
Okay, good.

159
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,340
你觉得只是恐慌症发作
You think it was just a panic attack

160
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,050
-还是她真打算...  -我不知道
- or was she really trying -- -I don't know.

161
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,580
他们要她留院观察一整夜就够糟了
It was bad enough they felt they had to keep her overnight.

162
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,210
我给白宫医生办公室打个电话
I'm gonna call the White House physician's office,

163
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,030
-看看他们能不能推荐什么人 -好
- see if they can recommend anyone. - Okay.

164
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,610
-等等  我的手机  -在你手里
- Oh, wait. My phone. - It's in your hand.

165
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,870
我今晚回来
I'll be back sometime tonight.

166
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,230
弹劾是我们唯一的机会
Impeachment is our only chance.

167
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,000
这些席位在中期选举中仍处于争夺状态
Here are the seats that are still in contention in the midterms.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,990
这13个我们再怎么努力也会失去
These 13 we're gonna lose no matter what we do.

169
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,960
但即便我们拿下剩下所有席位
But even if we win all the rest,

170
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,030
我们也只有五个席位的优势
that only leaves us with a five-seat majority.

171
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
要么保党  要么保总统
We either save the party or we save the president.

172
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,290
任何人反对弹劾的人
Anyone who votes against impeachment

173
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,520
在选举前都会受到攻击性广告的攻击
is gonna get pommeled by attack ads between now and election day.

174
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,060
你已经有多少票了
How many do you have already?

175
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,720
我们需要18票  我只有六票
We need 18. I have six.

176
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
那还要争取12票
So, 12 more to go.

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,250
唐纳德  我知道这是个很大的人情
Look, Donald, I know this is a big ask

178
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,440
你更想把注意力放在政策上  不...
and you prefer to focus on policy and not --

179
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,250
杰姬  不用说了  我加入
Jackie, you can stop. I'm on board.

180
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,380
-真的吗  - 百分百
- Really? - 100%.

181
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,670
不得不说  我有点惊讶
I have to say I'm a little surprised.

182
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,210
你把那些手推车推进休息室的时候  你说
When you rolled those dollies into the cloakroom you said,

183
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,850
"跟我合作  我不是弗兰克·安德伍德"
"Work with me. I'm not Frank Underwood."

184
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,450
然后你帮我通过了经济刺激方案
And then you helped get my stimulus package through,

185
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,050
你信守了诺言
just like you promised.

186
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,370
这次你有什么期望呢
And what do you expect this time?

187
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,020
我希望你永远不会成为弗兰克·安德伍德
That you never become Frank Underwood.

188
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,620
你要知道  如果我们成功了  他会取代沃克
You must realize if we're successful, he will replace Walker.

189
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,530
我不喜欢弗兰克  但我更讨厌成为少数党
I don't like Frank. but I hate being in the minority even more.

190
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,710
我们不能让共和党同时执掌国会两院
We can't let the Republicans control both houses of Congress.

191
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,970
我加入领导层以来  你变了
You've changed since I joined the leadership.

192
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,690
只是更懂得如何玩这场游戏了
Just getting better at playing the game.

193
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,530
看来顽固不化这词不太对
I guess you can teach an old liberal new tricks.

194
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,060
看来是的
I guess so.

195
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,500
告诉我你还需要谁
So, tell me who you still need.

196
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,730
我的律师说我赢得庭审的概率是一半一半
My lawyers are saying 50/50 that I survive a trial.

197
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,380
我不太满意这个数字
Now, I'm not a big fan of those odds,

198
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,320
但我愿意接受
but I'm willing to take 'em.

199
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,420
如果你的律师说这事就看运气
If your lawyers are putting it at a coin toss,

200
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,160
那你是花钱雇了一群太过乐观的人
then you're paying them too much to be overly optimistic.

201
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,470
我怎么能信任加勒特
And how can I trust Garrett?

202
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,640
他背叛了20年的友谊
He turned his back on 20 years of friendship.

203
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,460
他也可以这么说你
He could accuse you of the same.

204
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,370
这地球上没有人
Well, nobody on this planet

205
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,320
比我更想看弗兰克·安德伍德进监狱了
wants to see Frank Underwood go to jail more than I do.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,450
我只是不想到时跟他关在一起
I just don't want to be sharing a cell with him.

207
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,820
这种事不会发生的
That won't happen.

208
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,800
你只给了我加勒特的口头承诺
All you've given me to go on is Garrett's word.

209
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,180
他想让你说出实情
He's asking you to tell the truth.

210
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,760
做正确的事的人必有好报
Good things happen to those who do the right thing.

211
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,330
你们就指望弗兰克会跪地求饶
And you just expect Frank to lie down,

212
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,720
举旗认输吗
throw in the towel, hmm?

213
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
连求饶的机会也不给他
We don't even give him the chance.

214
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,080
你的证词会让他全无反击之力
Your testimony knocks him out cold.

215
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,800
请稍等
Excuse me.

216
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,920
什么事  啊  多谢你
Yes? Oh, thank you.

217
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,070
请等一下
Hold on.

218
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,010
给你
There you go.

219
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,930
我妻子送的小礼物
Care package from my wife.

220
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,610
那么  请继续
Now, you were saying.

221
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,630
我得提醒你一下  她现在完全不在状态
I just want to warn you, she's not herself right now.

222
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,550
他们不得不给她服用了大剂量的药物
They had to put her on some heavy doses.

223
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,730
什么药
Of what?

224
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,410
主要是碳酸锂[抗躁狂药]
Lithium, mostly.

225
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,620
不然就得留院观察30天了
It was either that or commit her for 30 days.

226
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,700
她刚吃了药  可能有点...
Now she just took some, so she might be a little...

227
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,960
梅根
Megan?

228
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,390
别碰我
Stop.

229
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,880
你妈妈告诉我他们从湖里救起了你
Your mom told me they found you in the lake.

230
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,880
你管我呢
What do you care?

231
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,980
我非常关心你
I care very much.

232
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,210
才怪
No, you don't.

233
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,560
没人会利用他们关心的人
You don't use somebody you care about.

234
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,620
娼妓
Whore.

235
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,950
荡妇
Slut.

236
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,570
婊子
Bitch.

237
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,040
叛徒
Traitor.

238
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,270
他们就是这么说我的
That's what they call me.

239
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,020
发邮件  在网上
In my mail. Online.

240
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,210
真希望我没打那通电话
I wish I'd never called.

241
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,850
真希望我没见过你
I wish I'd never met you.

242
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,070
你说什么我信什么  真是蠢透了
I feel so stupid believing what you told me.

243
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,340
我还以为你真心关心我
Thinking that you did care.

244
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,090
我本来都快恢复了
I was getting better.

245
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,050
这全怨你
You did this to me.

246
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,440
我每吃一片药  都会想到他
Every time I take one of these I think of him.

247
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,380
接下来我想到的
And the next face I think of?

248
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,540
就是你
It's yours.

249
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,770
你觉得被利用了  我很遗憾
I'm sorry that you felt used.

250
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,770
我没有利用你
You weren't.

251
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,130
我只是
I just, um...

252
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,790
就像我说的  政治风向变了  而且
like I told you, the political landscape shifted and --

253
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,620
而我们发现
and we found...

254
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,070
梅根
Megan?

255
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,210
你好
Hello?

256
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,290
我收到你的短信了
I got your text.

257
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
我知道我不该联系你  但我觉得
I know I shouldn't be reaching out to you, but I thought...

258
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,860
不  没关系  我很高兴你通知了我
No, that doesn't matter. I'm glad you did.

259
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,170
她怎么样
How is she?

260
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,930
状态很不好
In bad shape.

261
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,670
说实话我很吃惊他们还敢让她离开医院
I'm surprised they even let her out of the hospital, to be honest.

262
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,670
有什么我能做的吗
Is there anything I can do?

263
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,200
用不用我联系她的亲人  亲自去探望她
Should I contact her family or go out there myself?

264
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,330
我们最好不要打扰她了
We should probably leave her alone.

265
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,730
你还好吗
Are you okay?

266
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,250
我没事  你呢
I'm fine. How about you?

267
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,420
还撑得住
Uh, holding up.

268
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,960
和律师商量了一整天
Spent the whole day talking to lawyers.

269
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,110
这对孩子们太不容易了
It's hard on the kids.

270
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,390
他们既窘迫又害怕
They're embarrassed and frightened.

271
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,150
但我们会熬过去的
But we'll get through it.

272
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,630
我觉得你和加勒特的讲话很感人
I thought the speech you and Garrett gave was very moving.

273
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,550
似乎起了点作用
Well, it seems to have helped some.

274
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,200
其实我是受你的启发
I was inspired by you, actually.

275
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,730
你敢于在电视上承认堕过胎
When you admitted to the abortion on TV.

276
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,900
真相往往很有冲击力
The truth is a powerful thing.

277
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,550
特莉莎  我想向你道歉
Tricia, I want to apologize.

278
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,060
为什么
What for?

279
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,610
你的家庭所经历的这些变故
I feel partly responsible for everything

280
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,550
我觉得我有一部分责任
your family's going through.

281
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,300
是我建议你们去见咨询师
It was my suggestion that you get counseling.

282
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,340
早知今日  我当初就什么都不会说了
And had I known then, I never would have said a word.

283
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,240
克莱尔  别这么说  见咨询师效果很好
Claire, please. Counseling was a godsend.

284
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,200
加勒特和我需要帮助
Garrett and I needed help,

285
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,580
而且也确实起了作用
and it's made things better.

286
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,020
我应该感谢你
I should be thanking you.

287
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,840
还要感谢你把梅根的事告诉我
And thank you for letting me know about Megan.

288
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,700
你能去看她  真是好心
It was kind of you to make that trip.

289
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,590
你是个好人  克莱尔
You're a good person, Claire.

290
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,080
保重
Be well.

291
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,160
我估计你是想说听证会的事
I take it this is about my hearing.

292
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,430
是不是沃克联系过你了
Did Walker get to you first?

293
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,620
没比你快多少
Barely.

294
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,810
但有时候  哪怕只快一点也足够了
But sometimes barely is enough.

295
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,250
他肯定提出给你特赦
I'm sure he offered you a pardon.

296
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,680
提供竞争对手给不了的  才是高招
Always better to offer something your competitor can't.

297
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,220
但我能给你更好的
Oh, but I can.

298
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,180
据我所知  宪法规定的
The last time I read the Constitution,

299
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,190
副总统能给的最有价值的东西也就是...
the most a vice president could offer was, um,

300
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,160
陪陪笑脸  递递眼色了
smile and a wink.

301
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,130
我想我已经证明我不是一般的副总统
I think I've proven that I'm not your typical vice president.

302
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,730
一般或不一般  你都输了  弗兰克
Typical or not, you've lost, Frank.

303
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,380
我还有出路  你没有
I have an out. You don't.

304
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,580
加勒特撑不过弹劾的
Garrett will not survive impeachment.

305
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,460
你绝不能否认
If there's one skill you can't deny,

306
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,800
我拉选票的能力
it's my ability to whip votes.

307
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,920
那是在众议院  不是在参议院
In the House. Not in the Senate.

308
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,100
但依据宪法  我是参议院的主席
Which the Constitution makes me the President of.

309
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,870
你也看到我是怎么通过福利改革了
And you saw what I did with entitlement.

310
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,300
傲慢使你自以为了不起了  弗兰克
Hubris is giving you delusions of grandeur, Frank.

311
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,710
就算沃克侥幸逃过一劫
Let's say Walker squeaks by.

312
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,520
是的  你能得到特赦
Yes, you get your pardon.

313
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
但你却把自己跟一个
But you've bound yourself at the hip

314
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,090
没有任何政治资本的人拴在一起了
to a man who has zero political capital.

315
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,270
如果他被定罪  我们都要坐牢
And if he gets convicted, we all go to jail.

316
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,430
谁都没有特赦了
There's no pardon for anyone.

317
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,240
我愿意赌一把
I'll roll the dice.

318
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,710
雷蒙德  用你的商业头脑想想
Raymond, think like a businessman.

319
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,510
你不就是靠尽量减小风险积累财富的吗
Haven't you built a fortune by minimizing risk?

320
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,660
这不就是你这些年用钱堆砌国会
Isn't that why you stacked Congress all these years,

321
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,290
引领加勒特当上总统
why you guided Garrett to the Oval,

322
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,870
留我当党鞭的原因吗
and why you kept me on as Whip?

323
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,320
沃克是个垃圾股  贬值得快
Walker is a junk bond quickly depreciating,

324
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,890
而我可以迅速解决和中国的贸易战
whereas I can end the conflict with China

325
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,970
还能保你不坐牢
and keep you in the black.

326
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,100
你没法保证改善和中国的关系
You can't promise better relations with China.

327
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,720
我破坏的  我也能修复
I wrecked them. I can repair them.

328
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,510
一起合作吧  就如我们起初打算的那样
Now let's work together, as we always intended to do.

329
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,390
等你被关进棺材大的牢房里
When they put you in that box barely bigger than a coffin,

330
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,410
记住今晚这美妙的音乐吧
remember how beautiful the music was tonight.

331
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,680
或许能让你稍微好受点
It might give you some small degree of comfort.

332
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,000
普契尼太伤感  我喜欢积极向上的
Puccini's a downer. I prefer something much more optimistic.

333
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,370
他们不肯放布朗  审判日期已经定了
They won't touch Brown. The trial date is set.

334
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,200
他们可以减少指控
They can reduce the charges.

335
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,750
达拉斯不愿让步  如果我继续施压
Dallas won't give. If I keep pressing,

336
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,900
会显得可疑
it'll start to look suspect.

337
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,760
我能确保你不被起诉
What I can do is make sure you don't get prosecuted.

338
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,540
还有我不再替你工作
And I stop working for you.

339
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,600
不全是  我跟检察官说
Not quite. I told the U.S. Attorney

340
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,870
我们想让你为我们工作
that we wanted to bring you on with us.

341
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,060
网络恐怖主义分局  你的案底将一笔勾销
Cyber terrorism division. You'd get a clean slate, as --

342
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,400
门都没有
No fucking way.

343
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,230
他们不会就那么放弃你
They're not gonna let your case go

344
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,180
除非我们给他们充分的理由
unless we give them a compelling reason.

345
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,590
-没别的  -我跟调查局斗争了半辈子
- There's no o - I've spent half my life fighting the Bureau.

346
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,830
我只能这么说
It's the only way I could sell it.

347
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,160
抓住机会  嘉文
Take this opportunity, Gavin,

348
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,230
趁他们还没改主意
before they change their minds.

349
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,090
我要见道格拉斯·斯坦普
I want to meet with Douglas Stamper.

350
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,610
不行  我们说好了我帮你找出路
No. The deal was I find you a way out.

351
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,180
说好的是你帮布朗脱身并且还我自由
No, the deal was you help out Brown and you give me my freedom.

352
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,350
你没为布朗办成任何事
You haven't done shit for Brown,

353
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,390
还想继续控制我
and you still want to keep me under your thumb.

354
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,100
让我见斯坦普  否则一切免谈
So I meet Stamper, or any kinda deal is off.

355
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,180
雷蒙德没答应
Raymond said no.

356
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,230
他没表态
He said neither yes nor no.

357
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,720
我会继续施压
I'll keep the pressure on.

358
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
他还是有可能指证你
So he could still name you.

359
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,550
是的  一切皆有可能
He could. Anything's possible.

360
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,710
你得阻止他
Well, you have to stop him.

361
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,960
我在尝试
I'm trying.

362
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,580
尝试远远不够  弗兰西斯
Well, trying's not enough, Francis.

363
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,380
我总不能在听证会上坐在他旁边
Well, I can't sit next to him in the hearing room

364
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,700
拿枪抵着他头
with a gun to his head.

365
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,220
这听起来像在找借口
Now that sounds like an excuse.

366
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,510
事实就是这样
It's a reality.

367
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,540
你答应过  我不用做最坏的打算
You promised me I wasn't going to have to prepare for the worst.

368
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,030
我也打算信守诺言
And I intend to keep that promise.

369
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,920
我想确保  我们都要确定会没事
Well, I want to be sure. I want both of us to be sure.

370
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,290
唯一万无一失的办法  就是让沃克阻止他
The only surefire way is for Walker to call him off personally.

371
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,870
那就去办
Then make that happen.

372
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,220
我不能逼一个拿我当敌人的人
I cannot force a man who thinks I'm his enemy

373
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,170
突然把我当朋友
to suddenly call me his friend.

374
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,810
我该做的都做了
I've done what I had to do.

375
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,170
现在轮到你了
Now you do what you have to do.

376
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,810
勾引他  把你的心交给他
Seduce him. Give him your heart.

377
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,300
挖出来放在他手上
Cut it out and put it in his fucking hands.

378
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,820
亲爱的总统先生
Dear Mr. President,

379
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,730
我正在用我离开桑蒂诺时
I'm writing on an Underwood portable

380
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,580
我父亲给我的安德伍德打字机给您写信
my father gave me when I left for the Sentinel.

381
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,830
我父亲将它给我时说了些话
It was the words my father said when he gave it to me

382
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,620
比这台七十多年的机器更让我能产生共鸣
that have resonated even more than this 70-year-old machine.

383
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,020
"这个安德伍德建立了一个商业帝国"他说
"This Underwood built an empire," He said.

384
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,590
"现在该你去建立一个属于你自己的帝国了"
"Now you go and build one of your own."

385
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,880
这些话一直激励着我
Those words have been a large part of what has motivated my life.

386
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,230
我只用这台打字机写过另一封信
I've only written one other letter with these keys.

387
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,530
那封信不辱使命  希望这次也一样
It did not fail me then. I hope it will not fail me now.

388
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,960
您说我想削弱您
You said I wanted to diminish you.

389
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,820
实际上  我没有
The truth is, I don't.

390
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,950
您说我想在2016年跟您竞争
You said I wanted to challenge you in 2016.

391
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
实际上  我没有
The truth is, I don't.

392
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,560
您说我想自己当总统
You said I wanted the presidency for myself.

393
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,910
实际上
The truth is,

394
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,780
我的确想
I do.

395
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,630
哪个政客没想过
What politician hasn't dreamed about what it would be like

396
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,870
宣誓执掌国家最高权力
to take the oath of the highest office of our land?

397
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,040
我曾盯着您的总统办公桌看  觊觎它
I've stared at your desk in the Oval and coveted it.

398
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,260
权力  威望
The power, the prestige.

399
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,810
那些东西对我这样一个来自南卡罗来纳州
Those things have a strong pull on someone like me,

400
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,730
一座小镇  曾一无所有的人来说有致命的吸引力
who came from a small South Carolina town with nothing.

401
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,180
但自您就职时起
But since you assumed office,

402
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,760
我唯一的目标就是为您而战
my only aim has been to fight for you

403
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,930
与您并肩作战
and alongside you,

404
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,440
无论是在国会还是现在
whether that be in Congress or as now,

405
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,400
在这场弹劾之战中
the battle over impeachment.

406
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,070
或许有一天  我有幸能成为总统
Maybe one day I'll have my chance to serve as president,

407
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,000
但绝不是您在任期间
but not while you are the nation's leader.

408
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,800
在您身上  我看到了勇敢
And in you, sir, I see a brave man.

409
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,040
看到了正直  您是我愿意永远追随的总统
A just man. A president whom I would follow anywhere,

410
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,300
无论我们遇到多大的阻力
no matter how strong the wind blows against us.

411
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,510
有一件事我从没对任何人说过
I want to tell you something I have never told anyone:

412
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,190
我13岁那年在谷仓里撞见我父亲
When I was 13 I walked in on my father in the barn.

413
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,790
他把猎枪伸到嘴里
There was a shotgun in his mouth.

414
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,340
他朝我摆了摆手说道"过来  弗兰西斯
He waved me over. "Come here, Francis," He said.

415
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,810
替我扣动扳机"
"Pull the trigger for me."

416
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,910
因为他没有勇气自己做
Because he didn't have the courage to do it himself.

417
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,620
我说"不  爸爸"  就离开了
I said, "No, Papa," And walked out,

418
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,140
我知道他永远没有那个勇气
knowing he would never find that courage.

419
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,070
接下来的七年里  我父亲生不如死
The next seven years were hell for my father,

420
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,690
但我母亲和我更加痛苦
but even more hell for my mother and me.

421
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,910
他令我们都苦不堪言
He made all of us miserable.

422
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,980
酗酒  绝望  暴力
Drinking, despair, violence.

423
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,970
我一生中唯一的后悔  就是当时没扣动扳机
My only regret in life is that I didn't pull that trigger.

424
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,960
死亡对他来说会是种解脱
He would have been better off in the grave,

425
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
没有他我们也会过得更好
and we would have been better off without him.

426
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,900
我不会让您陷入同样的境地
I'm not going to put you in the same position

427
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,820
像我父亲对我那样
as my father put me in.

428
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,880
信中附上了一张纸
You will find enclosed on a separate sheet

429
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,170
上面供认了所有您被指控的罪名
a confession to the crimes you have been accused of.

430
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,060
都是假的  但我的签名会使它们成真
They're false words, but my signature will make them true.

431
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
有必要的话就用吧
Use them if you must.

432
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,050
如果您真的认为我的所作所为都是为了自己
If you truly believe that I have only served myself,

433
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,490
那么我已经永远失去了您的信任
then I have forever lost your trust.

434
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,840
我现在能做的  只有献出自己的自由以保住您
All I can do now is give you my freedom to save your own.

435
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,930
我说过我会替您承担责任
I said I would take the fall for you,

436
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,130
现在我把方法告诉了您
and now I give you the means to make that happen.

437
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,030
我要自己扣动扳机
I am pulling the trigger myself.

438
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,460
为了实现梦想我们都要做出牺牲
We all must make sacrifices to achieve our dream,

439
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,120
但有时为了大局必须牺牲自己
but sometimes we must sacrifice ourselves for the greater good.

440
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,220
做出这样的牺牲是我的荣幸
It is my honor to make such a sacrifice now.

441
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,960
您忠实的朋友  至少我仍这样认为
Your loyal friend, still in my heart,

442
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,880
即便您不这么想  弗兰西斯
if not in yours, Francis.

443
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,650
宪法列出了一般原则
The Constitution sets forth the general principles --

444
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,650
先生  总统的电话
Sir? The president's on the phone.

445
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,120
总统先生
Mr. President.

446
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,790
我收到信了  我让特莉莎也看了
I got your letter. I had Tricia read it, too.

447
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,140
我很纠结  弗兰克  一半认为你是恳诚的
I'm torn, Frank. Half of me wants to think you're genuine.

448
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,530
另一半却一个字也不信
The other half doesn't trust a word of it.

449
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,170
特莉莎也这么想吗
Does Tricia feel the same way?

450
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,700
她信任克莱尔  所以她也想相信你
She believes in Claire, which inclines her to believe in you.

451
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,020
我字字发自肺腑
I meant every syllable.

452
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,550
我想让您百分之百地相信
I wanted you to know beyond a shadow of a doubt

453
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,900
我愿做任何必要的事
that I am willing to do whatever is necessary.

454
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,530
那么  我为什么抛不开疑虑呢
Well, then why can't I shake the shadow?

455
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,170
因为我是个骗子  先生
Because I'm a liar, sir.

456
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,740
因为我无所顾忌  甚至可以说没有同情心
Because I lack scruples and some would even say compassion.

457
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,920
但那只是我展示给世人的一面
But that's just the image that I present to the world

458
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,620
因为那能使人害怕  让人尊敬我
because it elicits fear and respect.

459
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,990
但我不是那样的人
But it is not who I am.

460
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,180
我希望我的信能向您证明这一点
My hope was that my letter would prove that to you.

461
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,000
好吧  就算你说的都是真的
Well, even if you are being genuine,

462
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,880
对我也没什么用
that doesn't do much for me.

463
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,310
我想躲过弹劾  
I won't survive impeachment

464
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,350
不能只靠我和我的副总统关系好
because I got along with my vice president.

465
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,230
是啊  我同意  您需要的不只是我的好意
No, I agree you need more than my good intentions.

466
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,690
证明给我看  弗兰克
Proof. That's what I want to see, Frank.

467
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,090
别光承担责任  我要结果
And not just falling on the sword. Show me results.

468
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,510
那样我会重新考虑你是否值得信任
And then I'll reconsider whether you're worth any of my trust at all.

469
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,670
您是说投票
You're talking votes.

470
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,020
是的  拉票是你的强项
Yeah. Whipping votes was your strong suit.

471
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,230
我想看到你那一面
That's the side of you I want to see.

472
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,100
我已经开始着手了  先生
I've already begun, sir.

473
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,470
是吗  得到票数了吗
Yeah? You have a count?

474
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,060
只有个大概  形势一直在变化
An approximation. The sands keep shifting.

475
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,930
我们能得到众议院的支持吗
Well, can we survive the House or not?

476
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,620
有可能  但是杰姬·夏普在阻挠
Possibly, but Jackie Sharp is making it very difficult.

477
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,920
告诉我票数
Give me numbers.

478
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,690
她需要18票  已经拉到过半
Over half of the 18 that she needs,

479
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,700
所以我想从参议院下手
which is why I'd like to start focusing on the Senate.

480
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,320
你不觉得现在行动有点早吗
Don't you think that's premature?

481
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,030
我们必须有所准备
We should be prepared.

482
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,550
重中之重就是确保您不被定罪
The key battle is making sure that you avoid conviction.

483
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,540
你继续拉票  有消息告诉我
Well, you keep whipping, you keep getting me information,

484
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,220
我就等你电话了
I'll answer your calls.

485
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,330
但别以为你我就此相安无事了  弗兰克
But don't take that as a sign of reconciliation, Frank.

486
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,680
我会感激收获  先生
I'll sing for my supper, sir.

487
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,000
但我不会以为我能不劳而获
I don't expect it for free.

488
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,420
我们明早再商量
Let's talk again tomorrow.

489
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,660
谢谢您  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

490
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,200
你说你想有选择余地
You said you wanted options.

491
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
但弗兰克让我没得选  他坑了我
Frank didn't leave me options. He fucked me.

492
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,270
是你和塔斯克沆瀣一气  先把他坑了
You fucked him first when you sided with Tusk.

493
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,290
但谁管中间过程怎样
But who cares what happened each inning?

494
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,510
只有最终比分才算数
It's the final score that counts.

495
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,860
我在他麾下八年  为他跑前跑后
Eight years I spent busting my ass in this office.

496
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,070
看来还是躲不过为他卖命
I can't seem to escape it.

497
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,470
你是帮我们还是不帮
You gonna help us or not?

498
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,480
我要知道我有什么好处
I need to know what I gain.

499
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,020
-你会得到关照的  -说具体点
- You'll be taking care of. - Specifically.

500
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,310
等到尘埃落定  再看看要怎么办吧
We'll see what makes sense when all the chips have fallen.

501
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,830
那你是要我闷头往悬崖下跳
So you just want me to leap off a cliff

502
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,500
指望着运气好摔不死吗
and hope for a soft landing beneath?

503
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,100
现在谁都不会要你  除了我们
No one will touch you now. Nobody except us.

504
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,500
我们就是你最好的运气
We're as soft as you're gonna get.

505
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,850
能在白宫给我一官半职吗
A job at the White House?

506
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,880
这我说不准
No promises.

507
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,130
结果如何取决于你的
Other than something commensurate

508
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,160
忠诚度和经验
with your loyalty and experience.

509
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,290
我完全可以就此抽身  开始新的生活
I could just walk away from it all. Start a new life.

510
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,190
你抽不了身  你知道你做不到
No, you can't. You know you can't.

511
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,360
离了国会山  你只会衰萎
You'd wither away anywhere but the Hill.

512
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,320
不管你怎么骗自己
It's never been about the money,

513
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,740
你做这一行不是为了钱
no matter what you tell yourself.

514
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,190
我跳槽的时候  弗兰克求我留下
When I left, Frank begged me to stay.

515
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,800
他说"这是权和钱二选一"
"Power versus money," He said.

516
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,170
别屈尊加入那些缴富人税的人
Don't reduce myself to a tax bracket.

517
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,130
他说得对  但我不认为他会求你
He was right. And I doubt he begged.

518
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,160
他对了一半
He was half right.

519
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,730
只要有权力握在手里  就比钱有用
Power is better than money for as long as it lasts.

520
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,090
但权力总会滑出手心
But it never lasts.

521
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,040
你的回答是什么
What's your answer?

522
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,890
你当了党鞭之后变得更冷血了
You've gotten colder since you've taken over this job.

523
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,510
这样办事容易些
It makes things easier.

524
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,320
只是对外吗
On the outside.

525
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,600
内外皆是
And the inside.

526
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,640
我想你  杰姬
I miss you, Jackie.

527
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,840
你打算合作的话  就告诉我
Tell me if you'll cooperate.

528
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,940
你哥哥在议员手下干得如何
How's your brother enjoying working with the congressman?

529
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,170
我接个电话
Oh, excuse me one second.

530
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,730
总统先生
Mr. President.

531
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,210
我要你打给塔斯克  告诉他交易取消
I want you to call Tusk. Tell him the deal is off.

532
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,370
-什么  -你说得对
- What? - You were right.

533
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,050
我不想冒此风险
I don't want to take the risk.

534
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,190
但我已经和他谈过了
But I already spoke to him.

535
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,990
那就再和他谈谈  告诉他特赦没戏了
Well, so speak to him again. And tell him there's no pardon.

536
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,290
先生  我起初对这策略确实有些怀疑
Sir, I -- I -- I was skeptical of this strategy at first,

537
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,300
但我们已经选了这条路  就该走到底
but now that we've gone down this road, we should stick to it.

538
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
琳达  你还想回来做幕僚长吗
Linda, do you still want your job back?

539
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,350
当然  先生
Of course, sir.

540
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,810
那就打给他
Then make the call.

541
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,260
我想先看看众议院的结果
I'd rather see what happens in the House

542
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,650
再决定要不要帮你们
before I get involved in any way.

543
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,300
但如果你能表现出对总统坚定的支持
But if you came out vigorously in defense of the President,

544
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,960
可能会让司法委员会觉得...
it might convince the Judiciary Committee --

545
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,670
说实话  我并不是很想
To be honest, I'm not particularly inclined

546
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,120
帮沃克的忙
to be doing Walker any favors.

547
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,660
迈克尔  我知道他撤销了你的国务卿提名
Now, Michael, I know he revoked your nomination.

548
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,000
他完全没有为我争取
He didn't fight for me at all.

549
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,470
他那时刚刚当选  还没有足够的...
Well, he'd just been elected. He wasn't in a position to --

550
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,030
才怪  他明明有这权力
Wrong. He had a clear mandate.

551
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,240
他完全可以支持我
He was in a strong position to defend me.

552
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,760
你说得对
You're right.

553
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,060
如果我是总统  我不会那么轻易放弃
If I had been President I wouldn't have given in so easily.

554
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,990
我会在那篇文章曝光后坚定支持你
I would've stuck by you after that article came to light.

555
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,500
老实说  如果国务卿是你而不是杜兰特
In fact, if you'd been our secretary of state instead of Durant,

556
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,180
我们和中国的关系或许就不会这么差了
I don't think we'd be in the mess we are with China.

557
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,500
但事实是  如果换了我
But the truth is, I wouldn't have

558
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,920
我也不会提名你做国务卿
nominated you for secretary of state in the first place.

559
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,180
我会提名你做财政部长
I would have nominated you for secretary of treasury.

560
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,150
因为你在经济领域的专业知识
Because your expertise in economics is

561
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,110
比你的外交知识强得多
even better than your grasp on foreign affairs.

562
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,430
如果我是总统  你就会做财政部长
No, if I were president, you'd be secretary of treasury.

563
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,550
如果你是总统...
If you were president.

564
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,540
没错
That's right.

565
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,180
你不能这样
You can't do this.

566
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,640
怎么回事
What happened?

567
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,480
是弗兰克捣的鬼吗
Was it Frank?

568
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,730
琳达  听我说
Linda, listen to me --

569
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,160
我明白
I understand.

570
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,580
谢谢你
Thanks.

571
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,510
交易取消了
The deal is off.

572
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,970
她说原因了吗
Did she say why?

573
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,280
没有  只说他改主意了
No. Other than he changed his mind.

574
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,390
但肯定是因为弗兰克
But it must be Frank.

575
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,460
我们还是按原计划来
Then we go back to the original plan.

576
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,860
没错  和以前一样拒不解释
That's right. You plead the Fifth just like you did before.

577
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
这就是出政治闹剧
This is political theater.

578
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,430
-我们可以蒙混过关然后关注  -天呐
- We get past it and focus on the - Jesus Christ.

579
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,260
怎么了
What is it?

580
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,990
雷米·丹顿自愿去邓巴那里作证  就是现在
Remy Danton is volunteering to testify to Dunbar, right now.

581
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,220
他自愿的  不是被传唤的吗
He volunteered? He wasn't subpoenaed?

582
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,380
看起来是的
Looks that way.

583
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,680
他要出卖我
He's gonna sell me out.

584
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,560
那样的话他也会遭到起诉
That would open him up to prosecution.

585
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,880
除非他受到了保护
Unless he's being protected.

586
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,580
丹顿在哪
Where's Danton?

587
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,700
我给他助理打电话
I'll call his assistant.

588
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,570
你是否促成外资
Did you or did you not facilitate foreign money

589
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,730
流入政治行动委员会
being funneled into political action committees?

590
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,160
根据我律师的意见
On the advice of my counsel,

591
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,670
我保留行使第五修正案的权利
I reserve my right to invoke the Fifth Amendment.

592
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,910
冯山德声称你不仅是促成了此事
Xander Feng claims you not only facilitated,

593
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,290
更是最初的策划者
you orchestrated the scheme.

594
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,960
你如何回应这项证词
Now what is your response to that testimony?

595
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,500
根据我律师的意见  我保留我的权利
On the advice of my counsel, I reserve my right to --

596
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,940
你今天可以一直保留你的权利  塔斯克先生
You can reserve your right all day long, Mr. Tusk.

597
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,620
但等你面对陪审团时
But when you appear in front of a grand jury,

598
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,500
我确信司法部门一定会起诉你
as I'm sure the Justice Department intends,

599
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,540
你的沉默将使你垮台
your silence will be your downfall.

600
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,590
议员有问题要问吗
Does the congressman have a question?

601
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,760
你可以躲着我们  先生
You can hide from us all you want, sir.

602
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,140
却躲不过与你平起平坐的陪审团
You cannot hide from a jury of your peers.

603
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,810
-主席先生  -就这样吧  我说完了
- Mr. Chairman. - That's it. I'm done.

604
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,360
我放弃我剩余的时间
I relinquish the remainder of my time.

605
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,900
下面交给田纳西州女议员
The chair recognizes the congresswoman from Tennessee.

606
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,330
12分钟  女士
You have 12 minutes, ma'am.

607
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:57,080
塔斯克先生  我们卷入了与中国的贸易战中
Mr. Tusk, our nation is currently embroiled in a trade war with China.

608
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,730
这严重挫伤了我国经济
It has gutted our economy.

609
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,480
使我们的海军处于险境
It has placed our navy in harm's way.

610
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,620
-而使我们陷入这困境的总统  -他知道
- The president who put us there has -- He knew.

611
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,530
你说什么
Excuse me?

612
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,740
我的委托人保留
My client reserves the --

613
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,480
他知道  你们不就是想知道这个吗
He knew. Isn't that what you're all wondering?

614
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,850
请安静
Quiet, please.

615
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,290
知道什么  确切一些
Knew what, exactly?

616
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,700
有一套机制  它在过去10年里
There was a mechanism by which a great many contributions

617
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,200
贡献了大量的捐助款
were made over the last 10 years.

618
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,590
我仍然认为
The legality of this mechanism is something

619
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,290
这套机制并不触犯法律
that I continue to believe is within the boundaries of the law.

620
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,260
但至于该机制本身  冯山德先生说得对
But as for the mechanism itself, Mr. Feng is correct.

621
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,140
是我策划的  是我促成的
I orchestrated it. I facilitated it.

622
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,370
总统是知道的
And the president knew about it.

623
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,850
丹顿刚刚取消了
Danton just canceled.

624
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,550
去他的吧  我们有塔斯克
Screw Danton. We've got Tusk.

625
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,620
接通司法部长
Get me the attorney general.

626
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,910
没有这个必要  塔斯克先生
That won't be necessary, Mr. Tusk.

627
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,260
请和我们走一趟
If you'll come with us.

628
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,640
真可惜
That's a shame.

629
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,810
手铐也是我遗愿清单中的一项呢
Handcuffs were another item on my bucket list.

630
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,430
这边走  先生  你有权保持沉默
Right this way, sir. You have the right to remain silent.

631
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,660
你所说的一切将用来作为控告你的证据
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

632
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,290
我们谈谈条件吧  他在听证会上很配合
We'll want a bond. For his cooperation in the hearing.

633
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,130
认罪了再谈条件
I'll talk bonds if you'll talk a plea.

634
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,350
人们对证词的反应又快又强烈
Response to the testimony has been swift and vocal.

635
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,040
抗议者从昨天起
Protesters have been gathering in front of

636
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,860
便聚集在白宫前
the White House since yesterday,

637
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,390
要求沃克总统下台
demanding President Walker's resignation.

638
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,880
一份网上请愿书在过去24小时里
And an online petition has already accumulated

639
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,840
已经获得二十多万人签名
over 200,000 signatures in the past 24 hours.

640
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,360
两院公开谴责总统的人数
The list of lawmakers publicly condemning the president

641
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,580
越来越多
has grown on both sides of the aisle.

642
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,290
今天下午  中国大使
And this afternoon the Chinese ambassador

643
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,740
也谴责了沃克政府
also condemned the Walker administration,

644
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,150
指责其瞒着北京与腐败商人做交易
saying China would not negotiate with a president

645
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,770
他说中国不会与这样的总统进行谈判 
who dealt with corrupt businessmen behind Beijing's back.

646
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,980
如今  两国的军舰
This at a time when warships from both countries --

647
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,740
与此同时  总统与第一夫人
Meanwhile the president and first lady

648
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,250
仍在戴维营闭门不出  尚未对华盛顿
remain bunkered at Camp David and have offered no public response

649
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,390
最新的进展发表公开回应
to the most recent developments in Washington.

650
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,890
我们请到了《华尔街电讯报》的艾拉·萨伊德
I'm here with Ayla Sayyad of the Wall Street Telegraph.

651
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,660
艾拉  我必须先说
And Ayla, I have to begin by saying that sources

652
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,320
据国会知情人士透露
on the Hill are telling me

653
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,720
司法委员会可能完全跳过辩论
that the Judiciary Committee may bypass debate all together.

654
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,180
不  委员会还没有人正式发表这样的声明
Uh, no one on the committee has gone on record about that.

655
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,880
但如果不是委员会十分倾向于
But do you think these rumors would be circulating

656
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,050
建议众议院启动弹劾程序
if there weren't some sort of strong preference

657
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,240
也不会有这种传言了吧
to recommend the Articles of Impeachment to the House?

658
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,880
我认为几乎可以肯定弹劾很受支持
I think it's safe to assume there is strong support.

659
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,580
我看到的每份民调都显示
Every poll I've seen shows

660
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,990
很大一部分美国人希望更进一步
an overwhelming majority of Americans want this to move forward.

661
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,980
我觉得政客们不会无视这一点
I don't think politicians are going to ignore that.

662
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,580
我已经和我的一些同事聊过了
I've talked to a number of my colleagues already.

663
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,480
民主党这边有些支持者
There's support on my side of the aisle.

664
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,610
-你有多少  -现在包括我在内有五个
- Well, how many do you have? - Five at this point, including me.

665
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,540
那就一共有60个了  还需要七个
That would put us at 60. We'd still need seven more.

666
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,220
你也看了昨晚的民调了
You've seen the overnight polls.

667
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,750
他的支持率都降到个位数了
He's dipped down into the single digits.

668
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,160
你想和我们一起发表公开声明吗
Are you willing to make a public statement with us?

669
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,460
我觉得事到如今
I think the country could use

670
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,800
两党合作一下也不是坏事吧
a little bipartisanship right now, don't you?

671
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,700
你觉得他们在虚张声势吗
Do you think they're bluffing?

672
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,870
为了动摇参议院那些仍在犹豫的人而耍的花招
That it's some sort of stunt to sway the undecideds in the Senate?

673
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,790
迈克尔·科恩小气又记仇  先生
Michael Kern is bitter and small-minded, sir,

674
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,690
但如果他们没获得足够的支持
but he wouldn't appear publicly with Mendoza

675
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,240
他不会和门多萨一同公开表态
if they didn't have the numbers.

676
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,960
可以想象众议院的情况比之前更糟了
Well, I imagine we're worse off in the House than we were before.

677
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,080
其实我本来和杰姬·夏普聊得还挺有成效
In fact, I had a very productive conversation with Jackie Sharp.

678
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,740
她同意停止攻击
She agreed to stop the attack

679
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,380
只要我们在中期选举后支持她做多数党领袖
if we give her our support for majority leader after the midterms.

680
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,570
但雷蒙德一提供他的证词
But once Raymond gave his testimony,

681
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,590
她就打电话说交易取消
she called to say the deal was off.

682
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,300
雷蒙德真的给了我们很大打击
Raymond really has set us back.

683
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,920
我真想不通他为什么要撒谎
I can't fathom why he lied.

684
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,490
他要报复我
Well, it's retribution.

685
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,300
-为了什么  能源危机吗  -不是
- For what? The energy crisis? - No.

686
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,880
您给了他什么好处吗
Did you offer him something?

687
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,360
雷蒙德的证词确实于我们不利
Well, Raymond's testimony hurts,

688
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,780
但并没有终结我们
but it can't finish us off.

689
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,850
谎言是无法证明的
It's impossible to prove a lie.

690
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,540
弹劾不可避免
Impeachment is inevitable.

691
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,680
现在民众舆论成了敌人  事实已经不重要了
Public opinion is the adversary now. Facts no longer matter.

692
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,260
您应该给科恩打个电话  跟他本人聊聊
You should give Kern a call. The personal touch.

693
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,730
如果他重新支持我们
If he came back to us,

694
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,050
别的民主党可能就会胆怯退缩
it might make the other Democrats get cold feet.

695
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,700
中国也在帮倒忙
Well, China isn't helping.

696
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,080
钱主席不回我的电话
President Qian won't return my calls.

697
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,760
北京那边肯定觉得我气数已尽
Beijing must smell death.

698
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,750
他们只是在利用这个局面寻求筹码
They're just exploiting the situation for leverage.

699
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,650
现在先别考虑中国
Let's not worry about China for the moment.

700
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,990
一步一步慢慢来  先生
One battle at a time, sir.

701
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,260
我大概是完了  弗兰克
Maybe I'm finished, Frank.

702
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,600
也许我该接受  我们没法全身而退了
Maybe I need to start accepting that we won't pull out of this.

703
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,890
总统先生  我知道您累了
Mr. President, I know you're tired.

704
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,630
我知道这一切让您备受折磨
I know this has been hell for you.

705
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,460
确实  弹劾会是个严重的打击
And, yes, impeachment would be an awful blow.

706
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,460
我们要在参议院浴血奋战了
We'd have to fight tooth and nail in the Senate.

707
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,870
确实  我们将不得不哀求和妥协
And, yes, we'll have to beg and compromise

708
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,070
重新赚回我们的政治资本
to regain our political capital.

709
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,320
但我们一定会胜利  先生
But we have it in us, sir.

710
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,110
不管拼得多么头破血流
No matter how many scars it leaves us with.

711
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,190
不仅仅是我们  弗兰克
It's not just us, Frank.

712
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,070
还有特莉莎  还有我的孩子们
It's Tricia. It's my children.

713
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,880
我整夜失眠  想着他们看到父亲退缩
I stay awake at night, thinking how much it would crush them,

714
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,320
将是多大的打击
seeing their father hauled off.

715
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,760
先生  不会那样的  我不会允许
Sir, that won't happen because I won't let it.

716
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,180
如果我们遇上最糟的情况
If we're confronted by the worst,

717
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,930
我至少会确保您不会遭受牢狱之灾
I'll make sure you never step foot behind bars.

718
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,690
我向您保证
You have my word on that.

719
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,590
他现在身处黑暗
He's in the darkness now.

720
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,820
我是唯一指路的明灯
And I'm the only beacon of light.

721
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,020
现在只要温柔地把他引向礁石就可以了
Now we gently guide him toward the rocks.

722
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,630
总统先生  您还有我的信
Mr. President, you also still have my letter.

723
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,750
如果您想走那条路  现在还不算太晚
It's not too late, if you want to use that option.

724
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,750
不  你留在国会比待在监狱更有用
No, you're more useful to me on the Hill than in handcuffs.

725
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,500
我会给科恩打电话
I'll call Kern.

726
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,100
-晚安  先生  -晚安
- Goodnight, sir. - Night.

727
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,790
格林告诉你多少
How much did Green tell you?

728
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,520
足够让我现身
Enough that I showed up.

729
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,410
他大概没提到瑞秋·波斯纳  是吧
He probably didn't mention Rachel Posner, huh?

730
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,730
别担心  他不知道
Don't worry. He doesn't know.

731
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,650
但我知道
I do.

732
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,120
你把她藏在乔帕的一间公寓里
You have her in an apartment in Joppa.

733
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,460
我知道你的一举一动
I have your movements.

734
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,660
你有你毁掉手机之前的短信
I have your text messages before you destroyed your phone.

735
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,380
不过这已经足够了
But that's more than enough.

736
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,270
我相信很多人都很想知道她知道的事
I'll bet a lot of people would like to know what she knows.

737
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,700
你给我听好了
Now you listen to me very carefully.

738
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,720
不管你以为你拿到了什么
Whatever you think you've got,

739
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,900
也不管你打算拿这些东西做什么
whatever you intend to do with it,

740
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,720
我不会像格林那样被敲诈牵着走
I don't respond to extortion the same way that Green does.

741
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,520
格林给你的许诺
What Green promised you,

742
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,120
我瞬间就可以抵消
that can be undone in a heartbeat.

743
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,920
所以才把你找来  确保不会变卦
And that's why you're here. Make sure it isn't.

744
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,880
你想要我的保护
You want my protection.

745
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,230
我不信任格林或联调局的任何人
I don't trust Green or anyone at the Bureau.

746
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,520
还有谁知道
Who else knows about this?

747
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,030
没人知道
No one.

748
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,810
我为什么要相信你
Why should I trust you?

749
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,380
因为我们两个都输不起  伙计
'Cause we both have too much to lose, man.

750
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,890
穿上衣服
Get dressed.

751
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,710
你在干什么
What -- what are you doing here?

752
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,920
穿上衣服
Put some clothes on.

753
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,070
为什么
Why -- why?

754
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,140
快点  我们走
Now. Let's go.

755
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,030
有人联系你吗
Did anyone contact you?

756
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,050
你要带我去哪
Where are you taking me?

757
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,490
回答我的问题
Answer my question.

758
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,090
没人联系我
No. Nobody.

759
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,490
有人知道了我们的事
There's someone who knows about us.

760
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,180
知道你在哪
Who knows where you are.

761
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,970
知道我们什么时候见过面
And when we've met.

762
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,920
你是不是要伤害我
Are you gonna hurt me?

763
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,320
你和我说实话就什么事都不会有
Nothing's going to happen if you tell the truth.

764
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,140
我在说实话  没有任何人联系我
I am. I -- I haven't been contacted by anybody.

765
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,990
别再撒谎了  瑞秋
Stop lying, Rachel.

766
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,950
你让我干什么都行
I will do whatever you want.

767
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,920
求你别伤害我
Please, just don't hurt me.

768
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,940
我想让你回答我的问题
What I want is for you to answer my questions,

769
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,990
这样我才能帮你
so I can help you.

770
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,010
你一直以来都在毁掉我的生活
All you have ever done is fuck up my life.

771
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,200
你毁了团契的事
You fucked up the fellowship.

772
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,650
你毁了我和丽萨的感情
You fucked up what I had with Lisa.

773
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,960
即使我都按你说的做了
Even when I did what you asked.

774
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,570
你每次来找我都像变态一样
And your sick fucking visits,

775
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,620
要我哄小孩似的给你读书
and reading to you like a fucking child.

776
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,290
你有什么毛病
What is wrong with you?

777
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,570
为什么你就不能放了我
Why can't you just leave me be?

778
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,030
-为什么你非要这么  -住嘴
- Why do you have to be such a fucking -- - stop!

779
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,370
瑞秋  别做傻事
Rachel? Don't be stupid.

780
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,620
瑞秋
Rachel?

781
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,320
不会有事的
Everything's gonna be fine.

782
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,490
我做的一切都是想保护你
All I've ever done is try to protect you.

783
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,880
我现在也是想保护你
That's what I'm trying to do now.

784
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,600
你要相信我
You have to believe that.

785
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,580
我本来没必要保护你
I didn't have to.

786
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,380
那样事情会简单得多
Been a lot easier if I didn't.

787
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,800
但我还是那样做了  因为我...
But I did. I did it because I --

788
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,130
你干什么
What are you doing?

789
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,170
昨天我们结束了关于
Yesterday we completed hearings with regard to Articles

790
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,180
弹劾美国总统的听证会
of Impeachment for the president of the United States.

791
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,740
主席现在开始听取委员会动议
The chair will now entertain motions from the committee.

792
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,160
主席先生
Mr. Chairman.

793
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,780
主席请阿拉巴马州议员发言
The chair recognizes the congressman from Alabama.

794
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,100
我建议我们直接开始对提议进行投票
I move that we put our recommendation directly to a vote

795
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,660
这样众议院435名成员
so that debate on this important matter may take place

796
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,470
都可以就此事进行辩论
on the House floor, open to all 435 members.

797
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,830
委员会有人反对跳过辩论阶段吗
Are there any objections to bypassing debate in this committee?

798
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:20,900
现在开始对是否将弹劾状
We will now vote on recommendation of the Articles

799
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,280
送交众议院投票进行表决
of Impeachment to the full House.

800
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,870
同意提议的请喊"赞成"
Those in favor of recommendation say, "Aye."

801
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,150
赞成
Aye.

802
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,170
反对者
Those opposed?

803
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,360
反对
Nay.

804
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,100
赞成占多数
The ayes have it.

805
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,110
委员会正式建议众议院
This committee officially recommends Articles

806
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,640
对弹劾状进行投票
of Impeachment proceed to the House floor.

807
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:56,750
他来了
He's here.

808
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:30,320
副总统刚刚到达戴维营
The vice president is just arriving now here at Camp David.

809
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,360
我们预计沃克总统
We except President Walker to speak within the hour,

810
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,500
会在一小时内宣布
announcing his official resignation

811
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,630
辞去美国总统的职务
as president of the United States.

812
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,100
-你怎么样  -我还好
- How are you? - I'm fine.

813
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,450
总统先生
Mr. President.

814
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,750
我在厨房里煮了咖啡
I have coffee in the kitchen.

815
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,780
-要来点吗  -不用了
- Would you like some? - I'm fine.

816
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,040
你马上就要成为
Well, you're about to become

817
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,190
自由世界最有权势的人了
the most powerful man in the free world.

818
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,830
您没必要这么做  先生
You don't have to do this, sir.

819
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,650
我昨晚和科恩谈过了
I spoke to Kern last night.

820
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,590
他不肯让步
He's not gonna back down.

821
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,280
那我们就打败他
So we'll beat him down.

822
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,990
不  弗兰克
No, Frank.

823
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,320
我的支持率只剩8%了
My approvals are at eight percent.

824
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,010
即使我不被定罪  我也没有领导国家的威仪了
Even if I avoid conviction, I have no mandate to lead.

825
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,380
所以我还是有尊严地下台
So better I step aside with some dignity

826
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,320
让国家开始康复
so the nation can start to heal.

827
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,370
我永远无法与您比肩  先生
I can never fill your shoes, sir.

828
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,630
你现在没有选择了
You don't have a choice now.

829
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,940
你的信
Your letter.

830
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,210
好了
Well,

831
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,410
我们去向大家引见美国第46任总统吧
shall we go introduce the 46th president of the United States?

832
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,820
自即日起
Effective immediately,

833
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,680
我辞去美国总统一职
I am resigning the presidency of the United States.

834
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,050
特莉莎和我认为这是最合适的办法
Tricia and I believe that this is the best course of action,

835
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,710
既是为了我们和孩子
not only for us and our children,

836
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,650
更是为了这个国家
but for the country.

837
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,610
我无法否认  这对我们是不幸的一天
It's a sad day for us. I can't deny that.

838
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,950
但让我心有慰藉的是
But I take solace in this:

839
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,110
弗兰克·安德伍德将把美德  经验
Frank Underwood will bring virtue, experience,

840
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,700
和勇气带入总统办公室
and courage to the Oval Office.

841
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,770
由他担任我的副总统  是我的荣幸
I have been blessed to have him as my vice president.

842
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,470
而有他这样的朋友  更是我的幸运
But I'm even more blessed to call him my friend.

843
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,200
能够担任
It has been...

844
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,750
总统一职  服务国家
the greatest honor of my life

845
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,650
是我这一生无上的荣耀
to serve this country as president.

846
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,080
我感谢我的家人  白宫的工作人员
I thank my family, my staff,

847
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,220
以及所有那些支持我的人

848
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,480
尽管最近几个月风波不断
Despite the last few months,

849
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,130
但我对祖国的信仰愈发坚定
my faith in this country has never been stronger.

850
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,760
上帝保佑你们
God bless all of you.

851
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,600
上帝保佑美利坚合众国
And god bless the United States of America.

852
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,050
谢谢您的美言  总统先生

854
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,860
先生  请举起右手  跟我宣誓

855
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,830
本人  弗兰西斯·J·安德伍德

总统先生

860
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,400
总统先生
Mr. President.

861
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,490
国务卿女士
Madam Secretary.

862
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,010
内阁其余成员都在白宫等您

866
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,640
钱主席已经两天没回过总统的电话了

867
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,510

869
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,610
两个小时前  作为三军统帅
Two hours ago, President Underwood,

870
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,080
安德伍德总统下达了第一道命令
in his first act as commander in chief,

871
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,480
他要求第七舰队撤出日本周边海域

872
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,090
这得益于总统与钱主席进行的一次
This was a result of a productive conversation

873
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,290
颇有成效的对话
with President Qian,

874
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,420
而钱主席也对该海域的
who gave similar orders

875
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,980
中国舰队下达了撤退的命令
to Chinese naval vessels in the same region.

876
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,820
他行动挺快啊
He moves quick.

877
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,950
你是说对中国人  还是对沃克
Do you mean with the Chinese or with Walker?

878
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,030
-冯先生  -怎么了
- Mr. Feng? - What is it?

879
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,910
我们是司法部的  请随我们走一趟
U.S. Justice Department. We need you to come with us.

880
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,740
-去哪  -你将被遣返回中国
- Where? - You're going back to China.

881
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,500
我申请了政治避难
I have asylum.

882
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,110
不  先生  你的避难请求已经被驳回了
No, sir, you don't. Your asylum has been rescinded.

883
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,570
我有书面证明  无条件无限期的庇护
I have it in writing. Unconditional and permanent.

884
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:20,660
先生  我说过了  对你的庇护已经作废了
Sir, I'm telling you, your asylum has been rescinded.

885
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,810
请收拾个人物品  跟我们走
Now, please, gather your things and come with us.

886
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,610
驳回他的避难不是没有后果的
Revoking his asylum will have consequences.

887
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,450
但是法律上没问题吧
But we're solid from a legal perspective?

888
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,290
法律上没问题  他的文件还没进入批准流程
Legally yes. His initial paperwork hasn't been processed,

889
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,610
我们可以声称他对我国利益构成威胁
and we can claim he poses a threat to our national interests.

890
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:42,000
但这会削弱国务院的信誉
But it diminishes the integrity of our State Department.

891
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,060
哪一个更重要  凯茜  信誉还是和平
What's more important, Cathy? Integrity or peace?

892
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,200
你知道他会被处决的
You know they'll execute him.

893
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,170
中国人说对了一件事
The Chinese are right about one thing.

894
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,540
有时候  就得舍弃一人  保证全局
Sometimes you have to sacrifice the one for the many.

895
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,000
我们回华盛顿吧
Let's get back to Washington.

896
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,930
好的  请及时通知我  非常感谢
Okay. Please let me know. Thanks very much.

897
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,410
-有消息吗  -还是没有
- Anything? - Not yet.

898
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,890
你看看能不能通过戒酒互助会查到他的行踪
See if you can track down anyone from his regular AA meetings.

899
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,760
我和辅导员谈过了
I spoke to the moderator.

900
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,970
他说已经有好几周没见过道格了
He said he hasn't seen Doug in several weeks.

901
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:18,240
我查过医院  问过他的房东
I checked all the hospitals, his landlord...

902
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,070
先生  人都到齐了
Sir, everyone's here.

903
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,330
好  等手头事一过
All right, when this is all over

904
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,060
你和南茜一起找道格
I want you to work with Nancy on finding Doug.

905
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,940
我已经和特区警察局打过招呼
I've already alerted the D.C. Metro.

906
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,190
他们会对他的车牌发布全境通告
They put out an APB on his car.

907
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,450
我们会找到他的  先生
We'll find him, sir.

908
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,220

00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,690
我知道离你生日还有段时间
I know your birthday isn't for a couple weeks,

915
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,650
但我要送你一份礼物
but I got you something.

916
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,750
