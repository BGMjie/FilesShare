那就好  你这么说我就安心了

32
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,000
不会的  他会先和我们接触

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,250
-最好确保这一点  -我这就去和亚当说
- Let's be sure about that. - I'll talk to Adam.

34
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,860
也许避免和他接触会更好些
Maybe it's smarter to avoid contact.

35
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,170
总得有人出面回应
Somebody has to respond,

36
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,660
不是他就是我们  或者一起回应
whether it's him, or us, or both.

37
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,760
我们得协调好  小心应对
We have to coordinate, and do it carefully.

38
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,250
这事交给我吧
Let me take care of this.

39
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
我们先想好了

不会有问题的  弗兰西斯
I've got it covered, Francis.

你听克莱尔差遣

47
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,060
这事会解决的  先生
We'll shut this down, sir.

48
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,430
绝不能有差池
There can't be any doubt.

49
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,690
我们再过一遍时间线

51
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,470
这事伤害了我们两个人
This hurts us both.

52
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,440
但要着手去处理的人不是我
But it's not my wound to suture.

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,150
克莱尔必须亲自动手
Claire must be the surgeon.

54
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,240
只有她才能稳住局势
Only she can stop the bleeding.

55
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,590

多给你5%的追补股份

59
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,980
银泉旗舰店的人事也要经你认可

60
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,110
-接下来做什么  -签字就行
- So, what next? - You sign.

61
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,120
-然后我九万五就到手了  -这周末吧
- And I get my $95,000? - By the end of the week.

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,770
得先把钱从主账户注入公司账户
Just have to wire it from our main account into the LLC,

63
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,520
还得核对账目
had cash years to check for.

64
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,040
我还想给你看看这个
I want to show you this.

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,380
这是酱料瓶的样品
It's a mockup of the bottle design.

66
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,100
他们已经开始为银泉店的外观
And we already started on the concept layouts

67
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,460
进行概念设计了
for the Silver Spring location.

68
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,750
为什么墙毡都裂开了
Why's that linoleum peeling up?

69
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,340
追求真实感啊
To make it seem real.

70
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,500
我希望比这漂亮些
I wanted it to look nicer than this.

71
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,310
我们可以改掉墙毡的设计
We can scratch the peeling linoleum,

72
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,740
但不想显得太高端
but we don't want it to look too nice.

73
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,050
你想让白人有种体验下层生活的感觉

74
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,570
不  是为了营造地道的气氛

75
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,340
我就负责扮演黑鬼
And I get to play the nigger.

76
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,040
弗莱迪  你也知道这种事
Look, Freddy, you know how this works.

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,140
他们不只是来吃肋排
They don't just want the ribs,

78
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,390
而是要那种体验
they want the experience,

79
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,580
还不用出市郊
but without having to leave the suburbs for it.

80
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,990
我们又不是卖烛光晚餐的
We're not selling candlelit dinners here.

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,290
但我保证
But I promise,

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,950
所有决策都会经过你的首肯
nothing gets built without your signing off.

83
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,930
你想让我怎么办
So, what do you want me to do?

84
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,200
-我需要你出面否认  -否认恋情吗

恋情  照片  所有这一切
The affair, taking the photograph, everything.

86
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,630
我们有公开来往的记录

87
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,850
我曾捐献作品给...
I donated work for your...

88
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,020
你可以说那纯粹是业务往来
You can say we had a business relationship,

89
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,200
但你没有给我拍躺在床上的照片
but that you didn't take the picture of me in the bed.

90
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,020
就说是合成的
It was Photoshopped.

91
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,250
随便你怎么说
Whatever it is you need to say.

92
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,470
我很抱歉  克莱尔
I'm so sorry, Claire.

93
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,020
我只印了一版  还在我这儿呢
I only have one print and it's still here.

94
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,240
那个你也得销毁掉
You have to destroy it.

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,150
电子文档也要删掉
The digital file also.

96
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,660
但删之前先发给我们一份
But e-mail us a copy first.

97
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,390
为什么
Why?

98
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,200
我们得确认照片里没有任何痕迹
We need to make sure that there's nothing in the image

99
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,980
能联系到你的工作室
that links to your studio.

100
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,780
全都听你的
Whatever you think is best.

101
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,620
谢谢你  亚当
Thank you, Adam.

102
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,700
我当时在看
I watched you...

103
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,960
你接受CNN直播采访的时候
...when you did the CNN interview.

104
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,590
我本来打定主意不看的  但没忍住
I promised myself I wouldn't, but I couldn't help it.

105
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,180
我们要因为这种事才说上话真是遗憾
It's a shame it takes this for us to talk to one another.

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,380
除了这事  你还好吗
You're well, besides this?

107
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,100
嗯  你来过之后
Yeah. I spent three months in Colombia

108
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,790
我去哥伦比亚工作了三个月
after you came up here to work,

109
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,640
其实也是逃避
but also to get away.

110
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,210
我遇到了一个人
I met someone.

111
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,970

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,440

116
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,490
进展很快
Things happened quickly.

117
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,510

我该挂了
I should go.

119
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,290
得到指示前  我不能和媒体接触
So I won't talk to the press until I get instructions.

120
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,640
对
That's right.

121
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,590
能听到你的声音真好
It's good to hear your voice.

122

123

-打完电话了  -嗯
- You finished? - Yeah.

124
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,240
真是疯狂
Crazy, right?

125
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,040
海洛因  可卡因  霹雳可卡因
Smack, crack, blow.

126
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,540
不用  谢谢
No, thanks.

127
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,640
来点吧  老头  我们手里应有尽有
Come on, old man. We got what you need.

128
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,350

想要进门  就得买点

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,110
你说什么
What?

132
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,490
我认真的
For real.

133
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,330
你他妈的给我滚开
You need to get the fuck on outta my way.

134
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,510
跟你闹着玩而已  黑鬼
Just fucking with you, nigger.

135
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,490
他妈的冷静点嘛
Chill the fuck out.

136
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,240
你是谁
Who are you?

137
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,880
你爷爷  开门
Your grandfather. Open up.

138
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,240
你打算怎么办
What's your plan?

139
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,260
在家办公
Work from home.

140
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,900
就不会把闹剧带去白宫
You don't need me dragging this circus to the White House.

141
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,920
我是说声明打算怎么说
I mean in terms of a statement.

142
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,870
我们正在起草  力求简短有力
We're drafting one, short and sweet.

143
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,300
抱歉  弗兰克  但我必须得问
Forgive me, Frank, but you know I have to ask.

144
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,620
如果是真的  我会告诉您的  先生
If it were true, I would tell you, sir.

145
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,840
需要我发表公开声明吗
Would you like me to go on record?

146
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,010
说我支持你...
Say I stand beside--

147
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,140
不不  我很感激  总统先生
No, no, no. I appreciate that, Mr. President,

148
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,270
但您不该为这种烂事脏了自己的手
but you shouldn't dirty your hands with this sort of garbage.

149
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,320
如果媒体逼问
If the press corners you,

150
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,400
告诉他们您不会搬弄是非
just tell them you don't engage in gossip mongering.

151
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,150
先生  嘉乐威先生好像要上电视了
Sir, it seems Mr. Galloway is about to appear on television.

152
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,900
去吧  有需要就告诉我

153
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,020
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

154
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,940
下午好
Good afternoon.

155
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,720
我没什么好说的
I have very little to say.

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,700
只有一点  我从没和克莱尔·安德伍德有过私情
Only that I never had any romantic involvement with Claire Underwood,

157
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,720
也没有拍摄《特区日报》发表的照片
and that I did not take the photograph printed in the DC Daily.

158
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,950
我对副总统夫妇要面对这种
I'm sorry that the vice president and his wife

159
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,180
荒唐的折磨感到遗憾
have to go through this ridiculous ordeal.

160
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,880
我想请媒体不要把我和未婚妻卷入此事
And I would ask that the media leave both my fiancée and me out of it.

161
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,070
谢谢
Thank you.

162
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,880
一小时内能准备好吗
You'll be ready in an hour?

163
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,070
嗯  会准备好的
Yes. We'll be ready.

164
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,900
最好换身更...
You might want to change into something more...

165
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,940
-保守的衣服吗  -对
- Conservative? - Yes.

166
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,540
我先放点口风出去
I'm gonna go throw the hounds a bone.

167
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,380
我知道这很丢人...
I know it's demeaning --

168
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,280
不许再多说
Not another word.

169
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,100
我该更谨慎的
I should have been more careful.

170
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,610
这事就让它过去吧  就像以前一样
We'll put this behind us, just like we've always done.

171
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,250
我其实也挺希望
Part of me wishes...

172
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,570
什么
What?

173
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,810
你会更介意
That you'd be more upset.

174
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,140
塔斯克盯上你的原因是我
Tusk came after you because of me.

175
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,500
你才有资格介意
It's you who should be upset.

176
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,560
浪费精力  对吧
Wasted energy, isn't it?

177
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,170
对我俩来说都是
For both of us.

178
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,970
要排练一下吗
Shall we rehearse?

179
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,050
我不需要你的帮助
I don't need your help.

180
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,480
这不是施舍
This ain't a handout.

181
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,550
你得慢慢还给我  给我打工
You have to pay me back over time. Work for it.

182
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,240
给你打工
Work for you?

183
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,650
无论如何  我都会拿到房子
I'm gonna get the house either way.

184
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,910
你住不住  那是你的选择
Whether you choose to live in it is up to you.

185
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,170
是啊  我就需要这个
Yeah, just what I need.

186
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,050
你坐在安乐椅上
You in the easy chair,

187
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,320
每次我进门出门都对我冷嘲热讽
laying into me every time I come in and out the door.

188
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,780
房子是给你和杜肖恩的
The place is for you and DeShawn.

189
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,830
我住我自己的公寓
I'm gonna be at my own apartment.

190
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
你确定那黑鬼不是在骗你吗
You sure this nigga ain't just sellin' you smoke?

191
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,050
白纸黑字写在合同里  怎样都有九万五
Says it right in the contract, 95 Gs no matter what.

192
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,800
我不确定
I don't know, man.

193
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,820
五年没见
Five years I don't see you,

194
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,730
现在却跑过来  说你弄到了九万五
then you come knocking on the door, talking about you got 95 Gs--

195
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,960
是你的选择
Your choice.

196
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,690
你不想再让我去监狱里探视你
You didn't want me to visit you no more in jail

197
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,220
你出来之后也不想见...
and you sure didn't want to see me after you got out --

198
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,440
我还是不想见你
I still don't want to see you.

199
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,780
我已经站在这里了
Well, here I am.

200
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,300
滚出去  老家伙
Get the fuck outta here, old man.

201
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,340
听我说  孩子
You listen to me, boy.

202
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,150
我一直没什么可以给你
I never had nothing to give you.

203
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,360
我没有钱  我有的你也不想要
I didn't have no money, and you didn't want whatever I had.

204
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,910
但这可是一栋房子
But we talking about a house.

205
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,130
杜肖恩应该住在一个
DeShawn deserves to live better

206
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,110
-比这里更好的地方  -这不是为了他
- than in a place like this. - This ain't about him.

207
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,350
而是为了你
It's about you.

208
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,550
你知道去哪里找我
You know where to find me.

209
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,770
再见  孩子
See you, kid.

210
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,450
还有不到30分钟
Less than 30 minutes.

211
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,270
他们要否认吗
Are they going to deny?

212
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,860
还是让副总统和夫人自己来说吧
I'm gonna let the Vice President and his wife speak for themselves.

213
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,220
他们跟嘉乐威先生有联络吗
Have they been in contact with Mr. Galloway?

214
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,280
不  没有
No, they haven't.

215
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,470
为什么他们过了一整天才做出回应
Why has it taken them a full day to respond.

216
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,910
我相信你们肯定可以理解
I'm sure you can understand that

217
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,730
他们想先就诽谤与污蔑问题
they wanted to consult with legal counsel first

218
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,000
咨询法律顾问
regarding defamation and slander.

219
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,060
你是说他们要否认这段婚外情
You're saying they will deny the affair.

220
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,730
我是说他们30分钟之内就会出来
I'm saying they'll be out here in 30 minutes

221
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,570
你们可以引述他们的话而不是我的
and you can quote them instead of me.

222
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,540
谢谢你们的耐心
Thank you all very much for your patience.

223
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,740
真是恨死这个了
I hate this.

224
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,740
什么  等待吗
What, waiting?

225
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,110
不  婚外情  都是狗屁
No, the affair. It's bullshit.

226
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,170
我觉得自己像个小报狗仔
I feel like a tabloid hack.

227
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,210
你宁愿整天困在白宫那边吗
You'd rather be stuck at the White House all day?

228
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,790
去他的
Fuck this.

229
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,400
你要去哪
Where are you going?

230
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,110
用我的宝贵时间做点有意义的事
To do something meaningful with my time.

231
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,490
你好  帮我订一张飞往圣路易斯的机票
Hey, I need you to book me a flight to St. Louis.

232
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,140
如果可以的话最好是今晚
Tonight, if you can find something.

233
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,230
没有问答环节  别费心提问了
No Q&A, so don't even try.

234
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,780
请大家规矩一点
Behave yourselves, people.

235
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,340
竟然有人怀疑
I find it very painful

236
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,150
我对我深爱的丈夫
that anyone would suggest

237
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,090
会有不忠行为
I'm capable of being unfaithful to my husband,

238
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,180
这让我感到非常痛心
whom I love dearly.

239
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,800
我与亚当·嘉乐威已相识多年
I've known Adam Galloway for years.

240
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,190
我们都认识他很多年了
We both have.

241
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,970
我负责净水计划时
When I ran the Clean Water Initiative,

242
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,380
曾委托他为营销活动
I commissioned him to do a series of photographs

243
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,760
拍摄一系列摄影作品
for the marketing campaign.

244
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,000
而他也极为慷慨地为我们的筹款拍卖会
And he was extremely generous by donating work

245
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,240
捐赠了自己的作品
for our fund-raising auctions.

246
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,730
所以我不知道他为什么要否认拍摄过这张照片
So I'm not sure why he would deny taking the photograph.

247
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,730
我喜欢亚当的作品  所以让他拍了这幅肖像
I love Adam's work, so I asked him to take this portrait.

248
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,150
我们在这里拍的  就在这栋房子里
We did it here, at the house.

249
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,480
拍摄时弗兰西斯就在旁边
Francis was there during the shoot.

250
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,160
这是一份生日礼物
It was a birthday present.

251
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,370
克莱尔问我想要什么样的肖像
Claire asked me what sort of portrait I wanted,

252
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,890
我说就拍她睡觉的样子吧
and I said I want one of her sleeping,

253
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,610
因为她睡着的时候非常美
because she's so very beautiful when she's sleeping.

254
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,690
照片就挂在我二楼的办公室里
It hangs in my office on the second floor.

255
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,020
他们在说谎
They're fucking lying.

256
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,590
所以我只能猜测
So I can only assume

257
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,100
亚当被媒体的关注吓到了
that Adam was intimidated by the media attention,

258
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,060
所以想撇清关系
and he needed to distance himself.

259
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,990
什么
What?

260
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,720
但真相其实就是
But really, all we have here

261
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,000
他是一位才华横溢的摄影师
is a very talented photographer

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,250
而这是一幅我们很喜爱的作品
and a prized possession.

263
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,890
非常感谢你们
Thank you all very much.

264
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,070
谢谢你们
Thank you.

265
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,630
因为那样看上去就太清白了  好像我们...
Because it would've seemed too clean otherwise, like we were--

266
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,180
你让我丢尽了脸
You made me look like an idiot.

267
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,590
如果我们说法一致
If we had the same story,

268
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,570
媒体会认为我们是串通好了
the media would assume we were coordinating.

269
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,370
必须乱一些
It needed to look messier.

270
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,560
这事本该结束的  克莱尔
This was supposed to go away, Claire.

271
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,350
但现在我楼外的记者多了一倍
I've got twice as much press outside the building now.

272
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,250
亚当
Adam...

273
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,660
我不得不把灯都关上
I've gotta keep the lights off

274
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,650
因为他们在对面楼顶上  想要拍我们
'cause they're on the roof across the street, trying to film us inside.

275
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,330
你只需要证实照片是你为我们拍摄的
You just need to confirm that you took the photo for us.

276
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,410
证实我们的说法
Confirm our version.

277
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,910
说你说谎是因为你害怕了
Say you lied because you were scared.

278
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,950
我不明白你为什么不事先
I don't know why you didn't just tell me

279
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,750
把你要做的告诉我
this is what you were intending to do.

280
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,830
因为我了解你  你会拒绝的
Because I know you, and you would've refused.

281
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,310
你自尊心太强了
You have too much pride.

282
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,230
我不想再面对媒体了
I don't want to speak to the press again.

283
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,130
听着
Listen.

284
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
如果你什么都不说
If you say nothing,

285
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,220
他们不会放过你的
they're not going to leave you alone.

286
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,040
他们会在外面守上几星期
They will just camp out for weeks on end--

287
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,850
这...我觉得这样不对  克莱尔
This is... it feels wrong, Claire.

288
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,910
我觉得...
It feels...

289
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,330
抱歉我说谎了
I'm sorry I lied.

290
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,170
我并不是想摆布你
I wasn't trying to be manipulative--

291
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,190
我要挂了
I have to go.

292
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,510
亚当
Adam?

293
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,100
亚当
Adam?

294
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,300
我觉得他会想通的
I think he'll do the right thing.

295
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,210
不清楚  但愿吧
I don't know. I hope so.

296
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
要来支烟吗
Cigarette?

297
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,230
不用了  我去睡了
No. I'm gonna turn in.

298
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,010
他上电视了叫我
Wake me if he goes on TV.

299
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,080
-先生  -道格
- Sir. - Doug,

300
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,210
你和赛斯过来一下
why don't you and Seth come over?

301
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,260
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

302
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,720
要不要考虑起诉这家报纸
Should we consider a lawsuit against the paper?

303
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,020
表明我们不容忍这种八卦
Show we won't tolerate this sort of gossip?

304
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,130
他们不会和解的
They won't settle.

305
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,640
他们乐意上法庭  这样能制造更多新闻
They'll fight it in the courts because it'll generate more news.

306
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,620
总统那儿呢
And what about the president?

307
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,970
他提出要表个态
He offered to say something.

308
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,860
这样热度就更高了
Draws more attention.

309
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,130
总统发话不是个坏主意
President isn't a bad idea,

310
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,590
只要我们帮他起草讲话稿
if we phrase a statement for him.

311
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,640
如果他成了头条新闻
He becomes the headline

312
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,250
我们控制不了他的媒体策略
and we can't control his press operation.

313
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,610
但如果我们和他们协调好  就不会...
But if we coordinate with them, it shouldn't --

314
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,800
协调会让人生疑
Coordination looks bad.

315
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,780
所以你得让人看不出痕迹啊
So it's your job to conceal it.

316
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,980
如果赛斯觉得总统的讲话有弊无利
If Seth doesn't think the president should make a comment,

317
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,750
我们就相信他的判断吧
then we should defer to his judgment.

318
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,240
我再去拿瓶啤酒
I'm gonna go get another beer.

319
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,420
-我帮你去拿吧  -不用  我正想活动下手脚
- I can go grab you one, sir. - No. I feel like stretching my legs.

320
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,480
道格  来罐健怡可乐
Doug, diet Coke?

321
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,350
不用了  谢谢  先生
I'm fine, thank you, sir.

322
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,320
赛斯  来瓶啤酒
Seth, a beer?

323
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,680
我还得开车  谢了
I have to drive, but thanks.

324
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,930
我去去就回
I'll be right back.

325
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,720
你给我小心点
Watch yourself.

326
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,900
什么意思
What do you mean?

327
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,620
康纳很容易扳倒
Connor was an easy target,

328
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,070
但我可不是
but I'm not going anywhere.

329
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,000
道格  能有这位置我已经很满意了
Look, doug, I'm grateful just to be here.

330
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,900
我在副总统身边这么久
You think I've survived with the vice president

331
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,830
你这点小花招还看不出来
so long by being blind?

332
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,670
给他们工作的晋升空间是有上限的
Upward mobility has a ceiling with the Underwoods.

333
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,070
我就是上限
I'm the ceiling.

334
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,610
懂了
Understood.

335
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,990
你手里还有他们什么把柄
What else have you got on them?

336
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,140
没了
Nothing.

337
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,130
你交出日记的时候没留一手吗
You fork over the journal without a backup plan for a rainy day?

338
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,180
我不相信
I don't think so.

339
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,970
我有什么牌就出什么牌
I had one hand and I played it.

340
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,250
我不会冒险
I don't press my luck.

341
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,930
你不会指望我会相信吧
You can't expect me to believe you.

342
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,850
我没指望
I don't.

343
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,690
换做我是你我也不相信
I wouldn't if I were you.

344
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,070
但我说的是实话
But I'm telling the truth.

345
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,950
兄弟间的小斗争不是什么坏事
A little sibling rivalry isn't such a bad thing,

346
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,960
特别是在养子之间
especially between adopted boys.

347
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,990
他们要么彼此施压
They either push each other

348
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,790
两人都更上一层楼
to be the best versions of themselves,

349
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,550
要么其中一人被踢回孤儿院
or one of them gets booted back to the orphanage.

350
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,800
在我家  我喝你们也得喝
You're in my house. You drink if I drink.

351
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,020
你的健怡可乐  你的啤酒
One Diet Coke for you, and one beer for you.

352
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,060
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

353
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,680
亲爱的  真是一团糟
Oh, darling, what a mess.

354
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,910
亲爱的
Sweetheart.

355
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,270
你们还撑得住吗
How are you holding up?

356
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,120
媒体接连骚扰了我们两天
The press have been harassing us the past two days.

357
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,540
我们好不容易离开公寓  差点被他们踩死
we barely made it out of the building without being trampled.

358
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,870
太可怕了
Oh, how awful.

359
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,480
你说这儿有人要见我
You said someone was here to see me?

360
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,490
他在我办公室
He's in my office.

361
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,680
他告诉你他是谁了吗
Did he tell you who he was?

362
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,760
我不想在电话里说
I didn't want to say over the phone.

363
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
这世道什么都说不准
You never know, these days.

364
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,910
他说他以前为安德伍德夫妇工作
He says he used to work for the Underwoods.

365
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,430
-是谁  -你的助理
- Who? - Your assistant.

366
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,100
-不  她不会...  -她会  她做了
- No, she would never-- - She would and she did.

367
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,880
你有什么目的
Why are you doing this?

368
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,190
-不是我  是我的老板  -那是谁
- Not me. The man I work for. - And who is that?

369
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,610
这与你无关
That doesn't concern you.

370
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,170
你是在搅和我的生活
This is my life you're fucking with.

371
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,180
你和我都只是小卒  嘉乐威先生
You and I are just pawns, Mr. Galloway.

372
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,120
你走吧
You should leave.

373
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,350
我们需要更多证据...
We need more...

374
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,340
证明这事发生过  再给我一张照片
...to prove the affair happened. Another photograph.

375
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,780
给你30秒  走出这扇门
Thirty seconds, you better be out the door.

376
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,340
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

377
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,530
认识这个国家区号吗
You recognize the country code?

378
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,180
城市区号是波哥大的
And the city code is Bogotá.

379
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,480
还没人接听吗
Is it still ringing?

380
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,220
马歇尔
Marshall!

381
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,630
老爹
Hey, pops.

382
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,200
老天  从没见这里这么火
Man, never seen it like this before.

383
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,040
队都排到街上了
The line's down the block.

384
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,550
挺壮观  是吧
Something else, ain't it?

385
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,560
看来你需要人帮忙
Looks like you could use some help.

386
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,140
后厨还有条围裙
Got a extra apron in the back.

387
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,330
干活儿了
Let's go!

388
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,260
她赖在门厅不肯走
She refuses to leave the lobby.

389
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,510
她叫什么
What's her name?

390
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,720
艾拉·萨伊德  《华尔街电讯报》的
Ayla Sayyad, Wall Street Telegraph.

391
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,180
她是副总统记者团的成员
She's part of the Vice President's press corps.

392
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,910
这样啊
Oh, yeah.

393
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,100
叫她上来吧
Send her up.

394
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,370
多谢你了  特莉莎  我没事
I appreciate it, tricia, but I'm fine.

395
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,030
这件事闹个一两天也就过去了
This whole thing will blow over in a day or so,

396
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,220
那时我再
and I'll...

397
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,210
你能稍等下吗
Can you hold on one second?

398
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,890
《日报》来电  他们要你发表评论
The Daily. They called for a comment.

399
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,040
亚当和他们谈过了吗
Did Adam speak with them?

400
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,730
谈过了  但不是按我们的要求说的
Yes, but not what we told him to say.

401
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,960
他把这个发给报社了
He sent them this.

402
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,390
特莉莎  我能过会儿再打给你吗
Tricia, can I call you back?

403
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,960
-这是你吗  -不是
- Is that you? - No.

404
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,690
但他说这就是你
Because he's saying it is.

405
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,110
-可能是  -安德伍德夫人
- It might be. - Mrs. Underwood.

406
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,480
有可能是  没错
I mean, it could be, yes.

407
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,980
应该是
It probably is.

408
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,740
我特地问过你还有没有别的把柄
I asked you about any vulnerabilities.

409
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,240
我不知道他拍了这张
I didn't know he took this.

410
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,060
照片里你留着短发
You have short hair in the picture.

411
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,930
你说过恋情两年前就断了
You said it ended over two years ago.

412
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,550
我去年秋天去过他那儿
Well, I visited him last fall.

413
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,840
还有别人知道吗  有谁在那儿见到过你吗
Does anyone else know? Did anyone see you there?

414
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,010
他请朋友去过他的公寓
He had friends over, to his apartment.

415
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,290
我的天
Christ.

416
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,160
但我们说过他是位朋友了
But we've said that he's a friend.

417
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,370
我去拜访他  参加聚会没什么问题
There's nothing wrong with me visiting him, being at a party.

418
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,190
等这照片上了《日报》的头版就有问题了
There is if this photo is on the front page of the Daily.

419
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,950
在中国  政治和生意是纠缠不清的
Politics and business are intertwined in China,

420
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,350
想必你知道这一点
as I'm sure you know.

421
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,350
为了确保中央政府的许可
It's not uncommon to partner

422
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,910
结交有门路的合作伙伴很正常
with someone who can ensure Beijing's approval.

423
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,440
就是说你需要他的政治影响力
So you needed his political influence.

424
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,840
费尽心机  我们的合作还是泡汤了
All this is moot. Our venture fell through.

425
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,350
就在杰斐逊港大桥获批之后
Right after the Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.

426
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,200
我和那项工程没有任何关系
I had nothing to do with that project.

427
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,110
据我所知  冯也没有
Neither did Feng, to my knowledge.

428
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,370
是没有  但是吴彬阳投了资
No, but Wu Bin Yang did.

429
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,580
他是冯在北京的主要竞争对手
He's Feng's biggest rival in Beijing.

430
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,380
看来我没资格给你上中国政治课了
It looks like I shouldn't be schooling you on Chinese politics.

431
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,590
你比我了解的多啊
You know far more than I.

432
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,940
你用了"纠缠不清"这个词
You used the word "Intertwined."

433
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,110
这正是我对整件事的感受
That's the sense I'm getting from all of this.

434
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,040
核能补贴  中国精炼厂  大桥工程
The samarium subsidy, the Chinese refinery, the bridge,

435
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,220
以及你和总统的关系
your friendship with the President...

436
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,250
谁派你来的
Who sent you?

437
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,140
什么派我来
Who sent me?

438
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,690
财富积累到我这种程度
When you're as rich as I am,

439
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,140
就总得提防明枪暗箭
you're always a target.

440
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,290
我自己找来的
Nobody sent me.

441
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,290
但是你坐在这儿
You're here...

442
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,690
在圣路易斯采访
in St. Louis.

443
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,620
而不是去报道副总统夫妇的丑闻
Instead of covering the vice president and his wife.

444
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,020
我觉得冯山德背后还有更多隐情
My gut says there's more to Xander Feng than has been reported.

445
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,590
-是吗  -把时间花在这上面
- Yeah. - It's a far better use of my time

446
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,220
比报道什么八卦性丑闻更值得
than reporting on tabloid sex scandals.

447
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,440
那不是真正的新闻
It's not real news.

448
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,930
你怀念德黑兰了吧
You miss Tehran.

449
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,420
你在下面等待时  我读了几篇你的文章
I read some of your work while you were in the waiting area.

450
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,590
-那里越来越危险了  -可不是
- It started to get too dangerous. - Yeah.

451
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,690
那种环境不适合
Not the best place to be

452
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,940
结婚成家  生儿育女
when you want to get married and start a family.

453
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,420
或者犹太人
Or if you're Jewish.

454
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
也对
That, too.

455

我太太去那儿旅游时给我买了这个回来

托运回国的时候被弄碎了

460
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,170
摔得粉碎

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,650
好几名专家花了一年多才修复如初

只是给你提个醒

有些东西一旦碎了  再拼起来就难了

你要是想威胁我的话

468
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,300
完全不用这么兜圈子
you don't have to go to the trouble of veiling it.

469
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,320
我一般不接受记者采访

470
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,900
他们就是寄生虫
They're parasites.

大都一心琢磨怎么想办法打击我

自然而然
Invariably,

473
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,750
他们写的东西都不准确
what they write is inaccurate.

474
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,710
如果他们不如实写
And when that happens,

475
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,460
我就不得不反击了
I have no choice but to retaliate.

476

487
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,350
晚上带这么多钱走路太危险了
That's too much money to be carrying around at night.

488
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,820
我自己能应付
I can handle myself.

489
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,430
你对着枪口还怎么应付
There ain't nobody can handle a Glock to the face.

490
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,500
除非你自己有一把
Unless you got one yourself.

491
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,740
我早就不带家伙了
My days of packin' are long gone.

你把那东西带到这里来干什么
What the fuck you doin' bringin' that thing in here?

496

只是为了安全
Oh, it's just for protection, man.

497
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,690
我都不知道你为什么要有枪
I don't know what you doing with it anyway.

498
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,190
你的假释条例怎么办
What about your parole?

499
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,020
比起假释官我更担心
I'm a lot more worried about niggas in my building

500
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,720
我家楼里的黑鬼们
than some parole officer.

501
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,760
好了  坐下
All right, sit down.

502
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,250
你瞧  我说的就是这个
See, man? This is what I'm talkin' about, man.

503
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,020
你自以为是地评价我
You being all righteous and judgin' me and shit.

504

给我个面子  坐下  快点
Do me a favor and just sit down. Sit down now.

505
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,620
听着
Look.

506
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,340
我们可能遇到件好事
We got us a good thing, potentially.

507
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,150
可能最终没有结果  也可能会有好结果
Maybe nothing comes of it, but maybe something does.

508
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,930
如果连锁店成功
If the joint works out,

509
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,720
或许有一天你能当经理
maybe one day you could be the manager.

510
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,990
如果真的火起来
Shit, if it blows up,

511
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,290
你能去经营整个连锁店
you could run the whole fucking franchise.

512
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,280
但那意味着你得小心点
But that means you gotta be careful.

513
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,850
你不能再被抓回去了
That means you cannot be sent back inside.

514
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,060
我们得遵纪守法
We gotta follow the rules.

515
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,180
听懂了吗
Hear me?

516
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,780
好吧
All right.

517
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,430
你会处理掉那东西吗

518
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,670
会的

519
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,700
那就好

这才像个男人

这么短

我还要做模特呢  如果我剪那么短
I have a modeling career. If I cut it that short--

525
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,870
如果你真有模特工作
If you actually had a modeling career,

526
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,910
我就会在和你经纪人谈
I would be speaking to your agency,

527
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,200
而不是坐在你的公寓里
and not sitting in your apartment.

528
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,100
你到底想不想要这份工作
Do you want this job or not?

529
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,670
好吧
OK, yeah.

530
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,990
我可以剪短
I can cut it.

531
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,910
好的
All right.

532
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,640
在我们去摄影棚之前
And before we go to the studio,

533
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,230
我需要知道你是否口齿清楚
I need to see how well-spoken you are.

534
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,900
这有什么关系
Why does that matter?

535
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,500
因为你会出现在全美所有的新闻频道上
Because you're gonna be on every news channel in America.

536
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,660
等等  这是怎么回事

他承认犯有持械抢劫罪

548
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,850
以免受过失杀人的起诉
by pleading guilty to armed robbery.

00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,830
他服刑九年

副总统弗兰克·安德伍德是那里的常客

我想发布一份简短声明

他20年来一直遵纪守法

他是个杀死两位老人的罪犯

是意外
By accident.

564
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,580
那并不是重点
Well, that's beside the point.

565
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,470
我不能不管他
I am not gonna hang him out to dry.

566
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,160
如果没有嘉乐威的事
If the Galloway story wasn't happening,

567
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,520
我认为这可以
I'd say it's fine.

568
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,200

想想这看起来像什么样
Think of how this is shaping up.

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,450
还和前罪犯做朋友的副总统
and who is friendly with a former gang-banger?

572
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,470
你维护他不会有好结果
There is no way you win standing up for this guy.

573
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,680
他马上要开连锁店了
He's about to start a franchise.

574
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,960
我不容许这事告吹
I will not have it jeopardized

575
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,640
就因为塔斯克决定针对...
because Tusk decides to come after --

576
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,100
这不单是弗莱迪的问题  先生
Is more than just Freddy, sir.

他儿子因运毒和贩毒坐过牢

579
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,680
我没见过他儿子

580
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,030
这件事再缓缓  先解决
Let's hold off and tackle--

581
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,540
不  明早安排我跟记者见一下面

好的  先生
Yes, sir.

585

我不会对自己人见死不救
I won't leave one of my own bleeding on the field.

586
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,870
如果是华盛顿红人队
If you're gonna have the Washington Redskins,

587
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,560
那对手必须是纽约尼克斯队
then you're gonna have to have the New York Knickers.

588
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,560
{\an8}华盛顿红人是美式足球队  纽约尼克斯是篮球队

589
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,330
老爸  你完全弄错了
Pops, you ain't even deep like that.

590
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,780
走开  伙计
Yo, back off, man.

591
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,470

Back the fuck off.

达奈尔  别理他们就好
Darnell, just ignore them.

593
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,460
你当我在开玩笑吗
You think I'm fucking around?

594
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,250
达奈尔  别理他们
Darnell, ignore them! Ignore 'em.

595
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,300
我们不想被拍  他们就不能拍
They can't take our pictures if we don't want them to.

596
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,540
老子当然能
Sure as hell can.

597
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,660
你说什么
What you say?

598

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,140
第一修正案
The First fuckin' Amendment.

600
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,690
你他妈要给我讲宪法吗
You gonna read me the constitution now, motherfucker?

601
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,580
行了  达奈尔  我们进去吧
Come on, Darnell. Let's just go on inside.

602
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,820
不行  我和这混蛋还没完
Nah, nah, I ain't done with this asshole.

603
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,100
别碰我
Hey, don't touch me.

604
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,460
你能威胁我
But you can get all up in my face

605
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,620
我却不能威胁你吗
but I can't get up in yours?

606
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,120
-听你爸的  冷静点  -达奈尔  我们走吧
- Listen to your daddy and chill out. - Darnell, let's go.

607
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,950
别逼我
Don't push me.

608
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,350
小心我揍你
I will fuck you up.

609
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,600
你以为我怕你吗
You think I'm scared of you?

610
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,500
怕这个吗
You scared of this?

611
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,390
达奈尔  你的保释
Darnell! Parole!

612
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,920
能告诉我你的名字吗
Can you tell me your name, please?

613
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,300
斯特芬妮·道瑞
Stephanie Daldry.

614
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,120
我是一名职业模特
I'm a professional model.

615
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,030
右边照片里的人是你吗
And this is you in this photo on the right?

616
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,220
没错
Yes, that's correct.

617
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,770
道瑞小姐的这张照是昨天拍的
We shot this photo yesterday with Ms. Daldry.

618
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,370
你是说嘉乐威先生的照片是假的吗
So you're suggesting that Mr. Galloway's photo is a fake?

619
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,850
我对专业摄影一无所知
I don't know anything about professional photography,

620
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,810
我只是个做宣传的
I'm just a flack.

621
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,330
但如果我们都能在24小时内伪造照片
But if we can create a fake in less than 24 hours,

622
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,390
像亚当·嘉乐威那样的专业摄影师...
I think an expert photographer like Adam Galloway--

623
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,750
这指控相当严重
Those are serious allegations,

624
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,320
特别是在嘉乐威先生极力否认的情况下
especially given that Mr. Galloway vehemently denies it.

625
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,200
我对他的否认并不意外
I'm not surprised he's denying.

626
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,770
不过最后就是你们两人对质了
Ultimately, though, it's gonna be your word against his.

627
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,880
不是我
Not my word.

628
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,830
是美国的副总统
The vice president of the United States'.

629
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,540
他和一个可能有问题的人的对质
It's his word versus that of a potentially troubled man.

630
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,410
有问题
Troubled?

631
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,420
可能
Potentially.

632
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,000
或许他是有动机的
Or maybe he has a motive.

633
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,450
嘉乐威先生会有什么造假的动机呢
What motive could Mr. Galloway possibly have for a fake photo?

634
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,920
他能从中得到什么
What would he get out of it?

635
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,930
我不知道
I don't know.

636
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,640
我的工作是区分事实和虚构
My job is to separate fact from fiction,

637
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,630
这点和你一样  坎迪
just like yours is, Candy.

638
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,520
但或许对搞艺术的人来说
But maybe fact and fiction

639
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,960
事实和虚构不那么重要
don't matter as much to the artistic sensibility.

640
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,670
或许他分得不那么清楚
Maybe the lines are blurred for him.

641
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:51,260
他并不拍摄虚构的作品
This is not a man who stages fictitious scenarios.

642
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,090
刚才也说了  我不懂艺术
Like I said, the art stuff, it's over my head.

643
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,100
或许你是对的
And you may be right.

644
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,270
但我不愿相信
But I would hate to think

645
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,250
嘉乐威先生这么做仅仅是为了炒作
that Mr. Galloway was doing this just for publicity.

646
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,790
你认为这是炒作
You think it's a publicity stunt.

647
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,600
进来
Come on in.

648
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:02,960
先生
Sir?

649
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,080
弗莱迪在路上了吗
Is Freddy on his way?

650
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,180
他儿子出事了
There was an incident with his son.

651
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,700
发生了什么
What happened?

652
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,920
他因持枪威胁摄像师被警方拘留
He's in custody for threatening a photographer with a firearm.

653
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,430
上帝啊
Jesus.

654
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,610
弗莱迪现在在哪
Where is Freddy now?

655
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,460
他在家
He's at home.

656
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,970
我得去看他
I have to go see him.

657
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,260
那里是贫困住宅区
That's the projects, sir.

658
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,720
我不管  你看着办
I don't care, you figure it out,

659
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,310
而且不能让媒体知道
and the press can't know.

660
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,470
是  先生
Yes, sir.

661
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,900
弗兰西斯  我也很喜欢弗莱迪
Francis, you know I love Freddy...

662
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,890
我一定要去
I'm going.

663
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,260
弗莱迪有危险  是因为你太在乎他
Freddy is dangerous because you care too much.

664
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,050
太过在乎  会使人盲目
When we care too much, it blinds us.

665
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,900
塔斯克的做法太卑鄙了
What Tusk did is cheap.

666
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,560
但你却让这事影响到你  这正是他的目的
And you're letting it get to you, which is exactly what he wants.

667
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,790
如果我视而不见  无所作为
If I ignore this, if I do nothing--

668
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,590
这不是无所作为
It's not nothing.

669
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,190
保持专注也需要力量
Staying focused requires strength.

670
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,210
要我给你做点什么吗
You want me to make something?

671
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,850
你吃吧  我不饿
You go ahead. I'm not hungry.

672
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,820
你得吃点
You should eat.

673
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,740
对不起  这本来跟你无关
I'm sorry. You didn't ask for this.

674
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,830
这对你不公平
It's not fair to you.

675
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,370
我只想快点结束
All I want is to be done with it.

676
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,420
让我父亲平安
For my father to be all right.

677
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,170
如果我当时还有别的办法...
If I thought there was any other way, that...

678
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,780
我不想冒险让他...
I didn't want to take the chance that he would--

679
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,830
我知道
I know.

680
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,520
这些人
These people.

681
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,360
我一向知道他们很无情  但是
I always knew they were ruthless, but...

682
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,750
我们像动物一样关在这里
We're caged up in here like animals.

683
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,530
他们把我刻画成了那种...
They're painting me as some sort of...

684
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,900
还有你的家人
And your family...

685
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,410
太残忍了
It's inhuman.

686
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,380
他们太他妈残忍了
They're fucking inhuman.

687
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,980
生气也不能改变局面
Getting worked up isn't going to change anything.

688
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,470
我来
Let me.

689
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,910
你好
Hello?

690
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,150
弗兰克

691
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,640

谢谢你来看我

凑合吧
I been better.

695
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,090
从没见过你不穿西装的样子
Ain't never seen you without a suit before.

696
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,430
我们不想太招人注意
We didn't want to draw too much attention.

697
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,890
就是这样  我的城堡
Well, this is it, my castle.

698
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,600
不如你的大  但也够用了

702
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,930
《漆黑的夜晚》  每次听都让我陶醉
"Dark Was the Night." Gets me every time.

703
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,470
伙计  你早该告诉我
Man, you shoulda told me that years ago.

704
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,550
我会即兴演奏  聊起蓝调能聊一整天

克莱尔有一副三英寸厚的铠甲

这些难关我们会撑过去的
We'll get through all this garbage.

715
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,140
有人想毁了你吗
Somebody's tryin' to take you out?

716
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,700
看来是的
Appears that way.

717
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,780
无论是谁

00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,760
他们踩到不该踩的响尾蛇了

所以我来这里了  弗莱迪

720
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,210
我得远离你
I have to distance myself from you.

721
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,020
我要确保你不会到处宣扬
I need to make sure you're not going to play up

722

说你去过我的办公室
That you've been to my office,

还曾在我家做晚餐

而且总统也出席了那次晚餐

我再也不会来吃肋排了

我们不能再火上浇油了

739

那你为什么非得卖掉你的店

740
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,240
达奈尔的保释金
Darnell's bail.

741
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,020
那家伙不是无论如何都得给你十万美金吗

742
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,830
我屁都拿不到
I ain't getting shit.

743
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,700
合同里有一条道德条款
There's a morality clause in the contract.

744
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,570
但他打算花四万五买我的门面
But he's gonna pay me 45 thou for the storefront.

745
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,650
再加上我存的一点钱  就可以付保释金了
That with what little I got saved, I can pay that bond.

746
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,810
你不能把餐馆卖掉
You can't sell Freddy's.

747
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,660
他已经在起草合同了
He's already drawing up the papers.

759
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,350
但我一点也不关心
I didn't give a shit.

760
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,600
之后我被捕了
Then I got caught.

761
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,540
坐牢的第一年里达奈尔出生了
Darnell was born my first year in.

762
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,860
我一次也没见过他  连照片都没有
Never saw him once, not even a picture.

763
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,710
我不能收回我所犯的罪恶
I can't take back the bad I done.

764
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,520
我所能做的就是一如既往
All I can do is to make my own way,

765
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,100
自己想办法活下去  你明白吗
like I've been doing. You understand?

766
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,100
不是要强  弗兰克
Ain't pride, Frank.

767
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,510
如果你改变心意了  就告诉我
If you change your mind, you let me know.

768
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,610
你是一个好顾客  仅此而已
You was a good customer, that's it.

769
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,540
你不必假装是我的朋友
You ain't gotta pretend to be my friend.

770
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,700
多多保重  弗莱迪
You take care of yourself, Freddy.

771
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,260
你也是  弗兰克
You too, Frank.

772
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,250
你觉得我是一个伪君子吗
Do you think I'm a hypocrite?

773
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,510
那就对了
Well, you should.

774
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,500
我不会否认
I wouldn't disagree with you.

775
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,310
通向权利的道路由虚伪
The road to power is paved with hypocrisy...

776
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,390
和牺牲铺就
...and casualties.

777
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,590
永远不要后悔
Never regret.

778
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,890
这边请
This way.

779
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,560
请坐  亚当
Have a seat, Adam.

780
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,320
你按要求的那样  把电话留在家里了吗
You left your phone at home, as you were asked?

781
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,100
是的
Yeah.

782
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,910
你是怎么跟你未婚妻说的
And what did you tell your fiancée exactly?

783
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,780
就说我要离开一阵子
That I'd be gone for a while.

784
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,010
她不知道我要去哪
She doesn't know where.

785
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,380
如果有人找到她  她会说什么
And what will she say if someone checks in on her?

786
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,630
这是干什么
What is this?

787
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,650
她会说什么
What will she say?

788
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,650
弗兰西斯
Francis.

789
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,500
我们现在得协调合作
We need to work together now.

790
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,280
我试过  但你骗了我
I tried. You lied to me.

791
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,980
而我也解释了为什么要那么做
And I explained to you why that was necessary.

792
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,740
可你不听我的命令
You didn't follow my instructions.

793
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,950
你们知道雷米·丹顿是谁吗
Do you know who Remy Danton is?

794
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,050
他找过你吗
He approached you?

795
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,480
伊奈兹的父亲是波哥大的一位人权运动家
Inez's father is a human rights activist in Bogotá.

796
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,430
政府说他勾结叛乱分子
The government has charged him with treason

797
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,610
控告他叛国
for working with the rebels.

798
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,500
他们要判他死刑
They're going for the death penalty,

799
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,710
丹顿说他们可以操纵法官
and Danton said they have the judge in their pocket.

800
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,290
你应该来找我们
You should have come to us.

801
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,440
我跟他说了
I said I would.

802
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,390
丹顿说你什么也做不了
Danton said you couldn't do anything.

803
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,920
他错了
He's wrong.

804
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,300
我不能冒险
I wasn't gonna take any chances.

805
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,510
她父亲如政府所称那样犯罪了吗
Has he done what the government's claiming?

806
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,860
没有  都是些无中生有的指控
No. They're made-up charges.

807
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,250
他只是一个记者
He's a journalist

808
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,610
报道达恩地堑那里的残暴行径
documenting atrocities in the Darien Gap.

809
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,610
{\an8}巴拿马与哥伦比亚之间未开发的大片沼泽地

810
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,020
我可以撤销指控
I can get the charges dropped.

811
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,920
我凭什么相信你
Why should I trust you?

812
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,170
因为国务卿是我的好朋友
Because the secretary of state is a good friend of mine.

813
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,910
而且你别无选择
And you don't have any other choice.

814
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,780
我们不是你的棋子
We're not your chess pieces.

815
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,700
这也不是游戏  嘉乐威先生
And this isn't a game, Mr. Galloway.

816
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,810
那你为什么要耍我们
Then why are you toying with us?

817
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,690
我们只是想帮你
We are trying to help.

818
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,550
开什么玩笑  克莱尔
That's a fucking joke, Claire.

819
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,170
不准这样和我妻子说话
Do not talk to my wife that way.

820
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,730
你妻子  那对你来说有什么意义
Your wife. What does that even mean to you?

821
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,010
别因为你们之间有过一段历史
Do not mistake any history you have shared

822
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,650
就以为你了解我们的婚姻
for the slightest understanding of what our marriage is

823
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,200
相比之下  你完全无关紧要
or how insignificant you are in comparison.

824
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,140
能让我俩单独谈谈吗
Can you give us a few minutes?

825
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,900
我去给凯茜打电话
I'm gonna go call Cathy.

826
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,700
不说我的事业和名声吧
Forget my career and my reputation.

827
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,000
我想和这个女人结婚  克莱尔
I want to marry this woman, Claire.

828
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,890
我们会摆平这件事的
We're going to make this disappear.

829
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,580
因为你  我将永远是那个
Because of you I will always be the man

830
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,150
将她父亲置于险境的人
who placed her father in danger.

831
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,380
这永远无法抹去
I can never erase that.

832
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,860
很遗憾事情走到了这个地步
I'm sorry it's come to this.

833
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,420
我真后悔遇见你
I'm sorry I ever met you.

834
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,060
从头到尾  你只给过我痛苦
All you've ever done is cause me pain.

835
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,330
现在你又来破坏我的生活
Now you're fucking with my life

836
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,340
还有我未婚妻的生活
and the life of the woman

837
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,560
我爱她远胜过爱你
that I love more than I ever loved you.

838
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,880
你今晚就开车回纽约
You'll be driven back to New York tonight.

839
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,490
明天一早  你就发表声明
In the morning, you'll make a statement saying

840
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,320
说这是炒作
this was a publicity stunt,

841
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,610
你的作品一直卖不出好价钱
and that the value of your work had been stagnating

842
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,860
-所以你希望重振...  -不  克莱尔
- and you wanted to revive - No, Claire.

843
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,710
-我才不会那样做  -你会的
- I won't do that. - Yes, you will.

844
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,740
不如我去告诉记者
How about I tell the press,

845
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,500
-我被带到这儿来  -亚当  闭嘴
- that you, that I was brought here - Adam, shut up!

846
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,320
你要说你想博取关注  然后又害怕了
That you wanted the attention, then you got cold feet,

847
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,820
否认了照片的事  接着又再次改了主意
denied it, then you changed your mind again.

848
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,810
那张浴室照片是你伪造的
And that you faked the shower photo

849
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,230
你要澄清这一点
and you're coming clean.

850
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,400
明白了吗
Is that clear?

851
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,560
我不该被卷进这种事中
I'm not part of this world.

852
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,720
我没想搅进来  我也不感兴趣
I didn't sign up for it. I have no interest in it.

853
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,740
我们给你提供了一条出路  亚当
We're giving you an out, Adam.

854
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,370
如果你选择不接受的话
And if you choose not to take it,

855
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,570
我会毁掉你
I will bury you.

856
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,100
我从没恨过任何人
I've never hated anyone before.

857
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,000
现在我知道那是什么感觉了
Now I know what that feels like.

858
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,570
感觉很糟  对吗
It's a terrible feeling, isn't it?

859
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,300
终止呼叫
End call.

860
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,950
呼叫已终止
Call ended.

861
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,730
呼叫雷蒙德·塔斯克
Call Raymond Tusk.

862
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,180
他的住处没人接电话
No answer at his place.

863
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,660
是想要更多钱吗
Is it a matter of more money?

864
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,470
国务卿杜兰特已经致电莫里诺总统
Secretary Durant has already called President Moreno.

865
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,250
那我们得赶快行动了
So we need to move quickly.

866
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,570
外交部长已经牵扯进来了
The minister of foreign affairs is involved now.

867
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,630
法官不会在12小时内就宣判他有罪
The judge isn't gonna rush a conviction in less than 12 hours.

868
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,050
我们认识什么能跟部长说上话的人吗
Who do we know who has the minister's ear?

869
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,130
没有人能够比得过莫里诺总统
Nobody who can trump President Moreno.

870
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,440
而他对杜兰特对人权方面的看法非常敏感
And he's very sensitive to Durant's view on human rights.

871
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,690
你是打算放弃了吗
Are you giving up on this?

872
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,760
不  只是现实一点
No. Just being realistic.

873
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,270
那就做莫里诺的工作
Work on Moreno then.

874
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,770
我们快要被人察觉了
We'll start leaving footprints.

875
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,920
安静点
Quiet.

876
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,790
你说什么
Excuse me?

877
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,720
不是说你  是我的鸟
Oh, not you. My birds.

878
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,180
我觉得我们要做好准备
I think we need to be prepared

879
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,140
我们很可能没法把威胁进行到底了
for the possibility that we can't follow through with our threat.

880
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,910
我听到的都是借口  不是解决方案
I am hearing excuses, not solutions.

881
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,190
我无能为力
My hands are tied.

882
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,200
我没法搞定整个美国国务院
I can't circumvent the entire US State Department.

883
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,630
我雇你是为了让你毁掉弗兰克
You know, I hired you to destroy Frank.

884
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,410
你要失败了
You're failing.

885
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,040
雷蒙德  我是你的说客
Look, Raymond, I'm your lobbyist,

886
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,840
不是你的走狗
not your henchman.

887
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,040
我雇的不是说客
I don't employ lobbyists.

888
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,890
我雇的是对我有用的人
I employ people who can be useful to me.

889
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,050
而你看起来没用
And you are proving otherwise.

890
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,990
安静点
Quiet now.

891
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,500
我会想办法的
I'll figure something out.

892
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,380
快点
Soon.

893
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,480
行  就这样
Okay, that's good.

894
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,310
你不必这么做
You don't have to do this.

895
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,730
不  我必须这么做
Yeah, I do.

896
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,140
指控撤销了
The charges are dropped.

897
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:45,730
他们骗了你
They lied to you.

898
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,880
你也可以骗他们
You can lie to them.

899
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,730
还可以提出新指控
New charges can always be filed.

900
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,150
不能冒这个险
It's not worth the risk.

901
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,160
好吧
Ok.

902
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,980
你对我感到失望吗
Are you disappointed in me?

903
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,800
赶紧把这事弄完吧
Let's just get it over with.

904
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,320
好吧  开始
OK, go ahead.

905
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,910
我要做出一项声明
I'd like to make a statement.

906
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,510
还需要一些扫尾工作
There will be a little cleanup,

907
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,090
会有一些人继续关注这件事
some folks who will want to linger on the story,

908
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,000
但我们已经渡过最困难的阶段了
but we're over the hump, I'd say.

909
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,090
那我们现在可以出门了吗
So we can leave the house now?

910
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,260
越快恢复正常工作越好
The sooner you get back to normal work, the better.

911
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,410
之前被迫取消的会议
All the meetings I had to cancel,

912
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,950
想办法再做安排
let's find a way to get them back on the books.

913
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:30,560
是  先生
Yes, sir.

914
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,530
我得继续推动性侵法案
I need to push ahead with the Assault Bill.

915
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,660
我们安排了明天和马特·贝的采访
We've got your Matt Bai interview lined up for tomorrow,

916
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,340
但我认为...
but I think that--

917
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,240
也许我们应该等事情平息之后
Maybe we should hold off on Bai

918
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,670
再考虑贝的采访
till after things quiet down.

919
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,090
我刚才正打算这么说
That's exactly what I was gonna suggest.

920
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,190
道格说得对
Doug is right.

921
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,430
好  就这么办
OK, let's get going.

922
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:45,940
我在车里等你
I'll meet you in the car.

923
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,760
他这些事处理得很好
He's done a good job handling all this.

924
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,860
是的
Yes, he has.

925
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,210
那我们还要担心什么吗
Should we have any more concerns?

926
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,310
他说他没有别的把柄了
He claims he doesn't have anything else.

927
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,640
你相信他吗
Do you believe him?

928
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,050
还没到那个地步
I wouldn't go that far.

929
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,360
盯着他点
Keep an eye on him.

930
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,540
正有此意
I plan to.

931
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,180
至于雷蒙德  我们快速有力地回击
As for Raymond, we have to strike back hard and fast.

932
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,860
我要打垮他
I want him obliterated.

933
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,640
还不够
More than that.

934
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,990
让他受点折磨吧
Let's make him suffer.

935
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,270
真不知我是该骄傲还是害怕
I don't know whether to be proud or terrified.

936
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:21,170
也许两者皆有
Perhaps both.

937
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,340
真希望我能多给你一些
Wish I could do more.

938
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,400
你打算拿她做什么
What you gonna do with her?

939
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,750
还没想好
I don't know yet.

940
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,660
也许要把它拆掉
Probably have to knock it down.

941
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,460
空地价值更高
It's worth more as an empty lot.

942
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,170
你还有别的东西想拿走吗
Is there anything else you wanna take?

943
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,470
纪念品之类的
A memento or something?

944
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,600
没了
Nah.

945
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,690
我不是一个向后看的人
I ain't one for lookin' back.

946
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,740
我只向前看
Eyes ahead.

947
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,050
祝你好运  弗莱迪
Good luck, Freddy.

在现实生活中  美国一些不知名的街边小店
也经常迎来总统和议员们的光顾
2012年的总统大选开始后  奥巴马几乎每到一地竞选
都会在百忙中抽时间到当地闻名的餐馆食坊"尝尝鲜"
新罕布什尔"牛奶吧"的冰激凌  科罗拉多"辛克餐厅"的披萨
爱荷华州"罗斯餐馆"的"魔山三明治"  都被奥巴马尝了个遍
他一边走马灯似的拉票  一边扮演业余美食家
身边的记者们也都尽职尽责地
把总统在各地小吃  餐馆中"大快朵颐"的照片传给了全美选民

总统被身高2米  体重两百多斤的披萨店老板"拔地而起"的照片
成了2012年大选中最为经典  传播最广的一张照片
美国政客的一举一动都处于媒体的聚光灯下
当下美国的政党选举和党派斗争
已经不再只是不同的意识形态和政治立场间的较量
更是一场耗资巨大  无所不用其极的"公关秀"
"做得好"不如"演得好"
美国政坛中的各路人马无不挖空心思拉近同选民的距离
民以食为天
食物自然也成了每天上演的各档政治秀中的一个重要角色
不过政客们不是美食家
他们吃着嘴里的  惦记的却是选民兜里的选票
