我总不能把她扔到大街上

日本主权是最重要的

首相先生  我的忧虑越来越深了

72
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,560
我只需要第七舰队的一小部分

73
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,560
{\an8}隶属美国太平洋司令部的太平洋舰队  司令部设在日本的横须贺港

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,260
我们必须让中国认清局面

75
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,760
向中国展示  日美联盟坚不可破
Show them that the U.S. and Japan maintain a strong alliance.

76
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
你直接和北京方面联系过吗

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,730
他们拒不承认该岛属于日本

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,260
我得和我的团队讨论一下  拟订一个计划

83
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,250

可以看到该岛离台湾很近

86
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,320
这与钓鱼岛僵局的性质不同

87
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,030
可能是为航线的事
It could have to do with shipping routes.

88
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,220
或者贸易战  柿子总是捡软的捏

89
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,700
他们在对实力较弱的下手

90
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,260
-看到了吗  -什么

101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,310
出什么事了

102
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,850
我会在安全屋做解释
I'll explain in the safe room.

103
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,990
第七舰队在关岛附近吗
The 7th Fleet is near Guam?

104
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,910
北面90英里
Ninety miles north.

105
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,640
一周内就能派舰只去与那国岛
We could have ships to Yonaguni in less than a week.

106
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,550
但仅仅是向那个方向行进
But even sending them in that direction

107
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,590
都会被中国卫星发现
will be picked up by the Chinese satellites.

108
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,780
我们必须和盟友保持统一战线  这毋庸置疑
Well, we have to stand with our allies, that can't be in question.

109
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,680
如果我们不派遣舰只  而是发表声明
What if we don't send ships, just make a strong statement

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,320
强烈谴责中国擅入日本领海
condemning their excursion into Japan's territorial waters.

111
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,190
我们得给中国足够的压力
We still have to offer the Chinese an incentive

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,580
让他们召回驱逐舰
to call back their destroyers.

113
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,670
不论采取什么措施
Whatever overtures we make,

114
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,670
要做好应变计划
I'd like to have contingency plans in place.

Right away, sir.

120
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,300
那么同日本海军进行协调配合呢

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,790
去吧
Go.

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,300
暂时不要把我方海军牵扯进去
Don't engage with our navy yet.

123
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,370
我要直接和御城首相对话
I want to talk directly to Prime Minister Oshiro

124
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,630
表达我们的意思

125
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,030

Jesus.

129
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,450
我们逮捕了他  媒体没得到风声
We apprehended him. The press isn't aware.

130
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,620
很好  别走漏风声
Well, let's keep it that way.

131
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,870
他宣称对寄去国会大厦的
He claimed he was responsible for sending

132
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,180
装有白色粉末的邮件负责

133
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,850
那么这回他打算对我动真格的
So this time he really wanted to take me out for real.

134
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,490
不能算是
Not exactly.

135
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,550
他妻子上周背着他堕胎了
His wife got an abortion last week without telling him.

136
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,740

对  您是目标

We'd like to keep you down here with us, Mrs. Underwood,

139

我尽快回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

153
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,630
没事的
It's OK.

154
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,250
别去加州
Don't go to California.

155
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,990
我还想连任呢
Be nice to be reelected.

156
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,890
你会赢的
You're gonna win.

157
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,960
如果我不在选民前露面就不会
Not if I don't give the voters more face time.

158
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,230
你什么时候纹的
When did you get it?

159
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,720
在军队的时候
The Army?

160
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,830
是
Yeah.

161
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,380
那之后又添了些
It's grown since then.

162
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,700
和我说说
Tell me about it.

163
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,980
不
No.

164
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,890
为什么不
Why not?

165
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,700
我不想说
I don't want to.

166
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,790
你在干什么
What are you doing?

167
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,120
和我说说这个纹身
Tell me about the tattoo.

168
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,390
这不公平
That's not fair.

169
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,760
那又怎么样
So what?

170
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,140
你觉得让我湿了我就什么都会说吗
You think you can just get me wet and I'll spill everything?

171
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,720
我不是觉得
I don't think so...

172
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,360
我知道你会
...I know so.

173
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,470
告诉我
Tell me.

174
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,890
我喜欢那种疼痛
I like the pain.

175
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,400
针刺的疼
Of the needle?

176
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,770
对
Yeah.

177
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,920
有多疼
How bad did it hurt?

178
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,600
非常疼
It hurt a lot.

179
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,680
你喜欢疼痛
You like when it hurts?

180
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,410
我杀过很多人
I killed a lot of people.

181
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,470
什么
What?

182
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,120
在军队的时候
In the Army.

183
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,470
疼痛
The pain...

184
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,740
对我有帮助
...it helped.

185
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,360
继续
Finish.

186
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,740
我只能找到他开第一家工厂时
The most I could find was some wrangling with the EPA

187
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,980
和环保局的一些争端
when he opened his first plant,

188
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,780
但那都是40年前了
but that was almost 40 years ago.

189
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,720
我们需要更多
We need more.

190
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,340
我要塔斯克消失
I want Tusk gone.

191
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,670
我和道尔会继续查的
Doyle and I will keep looking.

192
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,180
你到现在还什么都没找到
If you haven't found anything now,

193
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,300
你怎么知道你能找到
what makes you think you will?

194
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,570
或许我们忽略了什么
Maybe we missed something.

195
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,180
我觉得没有  但可以再试试
I doubt it, but we could try.

196
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,480
你以为塔斯克此刻不是在谋划下一波进攻吗
You think Tusk isn't planning his next attack even as we speak?

197
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,010
我们查得很彻底  先生
We've been thorough, sir.

198
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,380
他从来不留痕迹
He doesn't leave footprints.

199
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,480
要改变策略吗
You want to shift tactics?

200
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,670
那赌场  我们尽快曝光
The casino. We go public as soon as possible.

201
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,400
你说那是万不得已的办法
You said that was a last resort.

202
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,480
赛斯  想个办法
Seth, you need to find a way

203
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,590
曝光赌场  又不会扯上我们
to make that happen so it doesn't link back to us.

204
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,030
如果我们点了这把火
If we launch that missile,

205
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,770
可能会烧到我们自己
it could blow us up too.

206
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,930
如果我们控制好就不会
Not if we spin it right.

207
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,680
-如果我们集中在...  -赛斯
- If we keep the focus on-- - Seth.

208
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,040
你是来听的  不是来出谋划策的
You're here to listen, not contribute.

209
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,710
我要是不想他出谋划策就不会让他来
I wouldn't have him here if I didn't want him to contribute.

210
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,560
先生  他接手才三小时
Sir... he's been sitting with this for three hours.

211
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,170
我已经研究了三个月
I've been working on it for three months.

212
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,280
而什么都没实现
And accomplished nothing.

213
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,000
我们该进攻了
It's time we go on the offensive.

214
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,350
你有什么办法
What do you think?

215
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,740
艾拉·萨伊德
Ayla Sayyad.

216
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,520
她已经在查塔斯克和冯了
She's already digging into Tusk and Feng.

217
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,670
她知道多少
How close is she?

218
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,160
她从没提过赌场
She never mentioned a casino,

219
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,110
但现在我知道要害在哪
but now that I know what the dots are,

220
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,250
我可以让她把一切联系起来
I can see that she's starting to connect them.

221
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,670
五角大楼还没有发言
The Pentagon isn't talking yet.

222
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,200
我猜他们在等白宫
I imagine they're waiting on the White House.

223
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,090
我听说从昨晚起他们就在
I hear there have been regular meetings

224
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,890
战况室频繁开会
in the Situation Room since last night.

225
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,650
我过会儿打给你
Let me call you right back.

226
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,060
-你好  -你好琳恩  我是艾拉
- Hello? - Hey, Lynne, it's Ayla.

227
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,110
我刚发给你张照片
I just sent you a picture.

228
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,050
-收到了  -这是什么意思
- Yeah, I got it. - What does it mean?

229
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,960
-有点奇怪  说不太通啊  -你说
- It's strange, it doesn't really make sense. - Tell me.

230
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,420
字面翻译应该是"追随货币"
"Pursue currency" would be like the most literal translation.

231
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
或者"追随金钱"
Or "pursue money."

232
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,710
跟踪资金
Follow the money?

233
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,070
-这么说也行  -谢谢  琳恩
- That could work. - Thanks, Lynne.

234
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,750
我喜欢你的新布置
I like what you've done.

235
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,210
沙发是新的吗  还有这些灯
This sofa, it's new? These lamps as well?

236
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,200
我做了些改动
I've made a few changes.

237
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,680
太熟悉一个地方
You get so used to a place,

238
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,160
再小的改变也会很显眼
the smallest things stand out.

239
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,530
抱歉我没能更早答复你
I apologize for not being responsive sooner.

240
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,240
我最近都在忙中期选举
I've been focused on the midterms.

241
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,170
你不用向我解释
Oh, there's no need to explain.

242
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,130
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood,

243
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,860
你知道我多么尊敬你的初衷
you know how much I respect your intentions,

244
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,270
但我经过深思熟虑  还是认为
but I've thought deeply about this and

245
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,250
我不能联署现在这份法案
I can't cosponsor the bill in its current form.

246
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,910
民事监管的提议太过极端
Civilian oversight is too extreme a step,

247
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,160
不过我愿意重新考虑
but I'd be happy to revisit some of

248
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,960
不那么极端的提议
the other less extreme proposals.

249
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,220
你认为我们太极端吗
You think we're being extremist?

250
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,700
我也想在这件事上出力
I want to help with this issue,

251
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,980
但这份法案要经过...
but this bill goes through--

252
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,370
这份法案要通过军事委员会
This bill is through Armed Services.

253
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,230
进入辩论指日可待
This bill has a date on the floor.

254
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,280
众议院几乎所有女性都支持这份法案
Almost every woman in the House supports this bill.

255
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,100
而我不能成为其中之一
And I can't be one of them.

256
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,980
你骗了我们
So you lied to us.

257
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,520
我没有
I didn't lie.

258
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,140
我没有撒谎
I didn't lie.

259
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,570
我想帮你们
I want to help.

260
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,050
只要我们重新考虑部分措辞
As long as we rethink some of the language.

261
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,030
你是不是因为嘉乐威丑闻的事
Are you trying to distance yourself from us

262
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,580
刻意和我们保持距离
because of the Galloway scandal?

263
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,290
-不是  -也许你认为和我合作
- No. - Maybe you think it hurts your chances

264
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,300
会对你谋求连任不利
of reelection if you associate with me.

265
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,760
不是因为这个  我是打心眼里不赞同这种方式
That's not it. It's because I honestly don't believe in this approach.

266
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,540
你意识到这会让外人怎么看吗
Do you realize the message this sends?

267
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,070
你是国会两党唯一一位女性领导人
The only woman in congressional leadership in both parties,

268
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,490
而你选择退出
and you bow out?

269
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,320
如果法案真能进入辩论  我不单会退出
If the bill goes to the floor as is,  I won't just bow out.

270
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,280
我会积极反对
I'll actively fight it.

271
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,510
你从未问过我的立场
You never asked my position.

272
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,630
你只是假设
You assumed.

273
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,330
我真无法想象你会是什么立场
I can't imagine what that position must be.

274
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,000
我曾在战区服役
I've served in war zones,

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,870
我对这事的重要性有亲身体会...
I know firsthand how important--

276
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,030
我们现在谈的不是战区
We're not talking about war zones.

277
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,520
而是性侵犯
We're talking about sexual assault.

278
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,360
如果让特别军事法庭审查内部机制呢
How about a military commission to review the internal mechanisms

279
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,980
我们不需要更多研究  我们需要改革
We don't need more studies. We need reform.

280
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,070
等我从加利福尼亚回来以后
Well, let's continue this conversation

281
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,250
再继续今天的对话吧
when I return from California.

282
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,330
我后天回来
I'll be back the day after tomorrow,

283
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,530
但愿你会改变想法
if you change your mind.

284
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,590
我不会
I won't.

285
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,460
但我希望你会
But I hope you change yours.

286
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,190
中国认为我们觉得可以收买他们是种侮辱
China was insulted at the notion we could buy them off.

287
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,070
需要我再联系钱主席吗
Well, do I need to call President Qian?

288
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,570
我看他不会与他的部长意见相左
I doubt he would contradict one of his ministers.

289
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,440
看看他是否愿意一对一谈
See if he's willing to talk one on one.

290
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,700
您得知道  先生
You should know, sir,

291
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,610
日本也正准备调遣三艘驱逐舰和一艘轻巡洋舰
Japan is also preparing to deploy three destroyers and a light cruiser.

292
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,900
他们在加大赌注
They're upping the ante.

293
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,850
让海因斯大使联络日本首相
Have Ambassador Hines get in touch with the prime minister,

294
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,230
看日本能否暂时按兵不动
and ask if Japan will hold off

295
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,940
让我先和北京取得联系
until I make contact with Beijing.

296
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,970
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

297
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,870
您休息过吗
Have you gotten any rest at all?

298
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,110
没  你呢
No, have you?

299
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,030
还没
Not yet.

300
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,710
克莱尔怎么样
How's Claire?

301
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,650
特勤局认为是孤立事件
Secret Service thinks it's an isolated attempt,

302
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,190
但他们加强了防备
but they're being cautious.

303
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,250
经过嘉乐威的事和电视采访
After the Galloway thing and the interview,

304
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,320
半数国民当她是婴儿杀手
half the country thinks she's a baby killer,

305
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,350
或出轨者  或两者皆是
or an adulterer, or both.

306
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,810
但克莱尔挺坦然的  我们没事的
But Claire's taking it in stride. We're in good hands.

307
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,980
真是太可怕了
That's very frightening.

308
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,250
怪不得你无暇休息
I can see why you haven't slept.

309
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,620
我们有一人得休息会儿
One of us should,

310
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,020
还是做决策的那个休息吧
probably the one that's calling all the shots.

311
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,960
不用  我可以再坚持一会儿
No, I can hold out a little while longer.

312
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,040
别  回宅邸吧  去陪陪你妻子
No, go to the residence, spend some time with your wife.

313
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,870
回来后会感觉焕然一新
You'll come back feeling like a new man.

314
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,840
说真的
Honestly, it's...

315
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,700
这里的压力反而更小
less stressful here.

316
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,390
咨询没效果吗
Counseling hasn't helped?

317
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,030
不是  慢慢在起效吧
No, it has... slowly.

318
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,360
琳达辞职的时候  我也开除了克里斯蒂娜
I got rid of Christina when Linda resigned.

319
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,470
我听说了
I heard.

320
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,610
情况多少改善了一些  但是...
It's improved things some, but...

321
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,540
还需要努力
...there's still work to do.

322
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,810
但是想想都让我觉得累
Makes me tired just to think about it.

323
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,180
您应该不是第一位
Well, you probably wouldn't be the first

324
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,290
在这几个沙发上打盹的总统
president to get a little shut-eye on one of these sofas.

325
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,640
-我是开玩笑呢  -我不是
- I was joking. - I wasn't.

326
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
行行好  休息一下吧
Do the free world a favor and get some rest.

327
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,340
我先出去了
I'll let you be.

328
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,470
不用  待在这儿吧
No, stick around.

329
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,650
如果钱主席愿电话沟通  你也该在场
You should be nearby if President Qian wants to get on the phone.

330
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,880
我一向讨厌睡眠的必要性
I've always loathed the necessity of sleep.

331
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,710
它跟死亡一样  能让最强大的人倒下
Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.

332
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,880
特区豪车巴士租赁

这里是阿道希赌场的出行部
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.

334
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,050
我们有公司账户
We've got a corporate account.

335
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,190
我看看
Let's see...

336
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,910
抱歉  我们记录里没有
Yeah, I'm sorry, we don't have one in our records.

337
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,730
我的错  我一定是打错电话了  谢谢
My mistake. I must have called the wrong limo service. Thank you.

338
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,890
密苏里巴士豪车
Missouri Bus and Limo.

339
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,280
这里是阿道希赌场的出行部
I'm calling from the Adohi Casino's travel department.

340
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,210
你不是达琳
You're not Darlene.

341
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,870
不是  达琳请病假了
No. Darlene is out sick.

342
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,820
由我代班  我叫帕姆
I'm filling in for her. My name is Pam.

343
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,540
我能为你做什么  帕姆
How can I help you, Pam?

344
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,020
我们明天要接待来自中国的航班
We've got a flight coming in from China tomorrow.

345
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,930
我们需要车
We'll need some transportation.

346
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,740
有多少乘客
How many you got coming?

347
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,540
我手里没有乘客名单
I don't have the manifest right

348
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,000
照常吗
The usual?

349
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,910
没错
That's right.

350
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,460
那就是一辆豪华巴士
So a luxury bus.

351
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,480
能坐多少人
How many does that fit?

352
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,540
55人
55.

353
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,010
通常拉20个人左右
Usually about 20 come in.

354
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,090
-空间应该足够了  -太棒了  谢谢
- Should be plenty of room. - That's great. Thanks.

355
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,510
你觉得她是真心不认同
Do you think it's really her conscience,

356
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,410
还是因为法案太有争议
or because the bill is controversial?

357
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,210
如果她只是想避免争议
I don't think she would have threatened to fight us

358
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,750
就不会说要积极反对了
if all she wanted to do was avoid controversy.

359
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,460
我去跟她谈
I'll talk to her.

360
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,900
我真的很希望这个法案能通过
I really want this bill to pass.

361
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,220
我知道  我也是
I know you do, so do I.

362
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,120
我们现在非常需要杰姬  弗兰西斯
We need Jackie more than ever, Francis.

363
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,890
我现在成坏女人了
I'm damaged goods,

364
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,960
就因为亚当那事
this whole Adam thing.

365
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,200
不  你不是
No, you're not.

366
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,610
我们一起挺过去了
We fought past that.

367
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,970
还是有很多人相信那确有其事
Well, there's plenty of people who still believe it's true.

368
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,330
我们会度过这一关的  我发誓
We'll get it passed, I promise.

369
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,790
不  谢谢
No, thanks.

370
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,870
得了
Come on.

371
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,320
我自己抽没意思
It's no fun doing it alone.

372
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,990
我们可以去跑跑步
We could just go for a run.

373
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,680
死亡威胁平息前  不能再去跑步了
No more runs until the death threats die down,

374
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,790
这是新规则
that's the new rule.

375
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,460
但他们让你去办公室了
But they let you go to the office.

376
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,410
因为我坐的是防弹车
Because I was in a bulletproof car.

377
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,940
那这样一来我们是没戒烟了吗
Does this mean we've officially not quit?

378
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,320
我们向来不会轻言放弃  不是吗
We've never been quitters, have we?

379
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,210
先生  安德伍德夫人
Sir, Mrs. Underwood,

380
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,570
很抱歉打扰你们
sorry to interrupt.

381
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,160
我要回家了
I was gonna head home,

382
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,100
但如果你们想让我留下  我就留下
but I'll stick around if you want me to.

383
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,980
不  你已经熬很久了  去睡会儿吧
Oh, no. You've been up long enough. Get some sleep.

384
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,000
我明天一早就回来
I'll be back first thing in the morning.

385
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,990
谢谢你今天照顾我
Thank you for looking after me today.

386
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,560
我的荣幸  夫人
My pleasure, ma'am.

387
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,540
先生  安德伍德夫人  再见
Sir, Mrs. Underwood.

388
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,540
他非常尽忠
He's very dedicated.

389
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,840
确实
He is.

390
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,180
很难找到艾德华这样的人
It's rare to find someone like Edward.

391
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,300
怎么了
What?

392
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,270
你从不直呼他名字
You never use his first name.

393
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,370
是吗
Oh, did I?

394
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,520
我觉得这样谈论她不太好
I don't feel right talking about her like this.

395
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,580
就是...严格讲  她现在是我上司
It's just... technically, she's my boss now.

396
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,970
有规矩的
There's a certain protocol.

397
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,780
这是道格的意思
This is coming directly from Doug.

398
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,300
也就是副总统本人的意思
Which means it's coming directly from the vice president.

399
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,670
我见到过几次丹顿先生
I have seen Mr. Danton around from time to time.

400
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,640
你知道他跟议员女士在商讨什么吗
Do you know what he and the congresswoman were discussing?

401
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,030
不知道  都是私人会面
No, they were private meetings.

402
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,010
你有预约日程表吗
Do you have the appointment schedule?

403
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,770
我想看看日期
I'd like to look at the dates.

404
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,440
不是正式约会
These weren't formal appointments.

405
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,500
他就是顺路来看看
He just stops by.

406
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,050
大多数都是晚上很晚的时候
Most of the time pretty late at night.

407
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,230
钱是不是从中国来的
Did the money originate in China?

408
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,820
钱来自部落收入
The money came from tribal revenue.

409
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,830
我们的联邦选举委员会报告上写得很清楚
As our FEC reports clearly stated.

410
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,620
我换个说法
Let me rephrase.

411
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,270
这些部落收入是否来自
Did any of that revenue come from

412
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,780
去你赌场的中国游客
Chinese visitors who gambled at your casino?

413
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,820
我们有来自世界各地的游客
We have visitors from all over the world.

414
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,190
我只关注一个叫冯山德的商人
I'm speaking specifically about a businessman named Xander Feng.

415
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,370
我不知道那是谁
I have no idea who that is.

416
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,560
我查到空管局的记录显示
I'm looking at FAA flight records that show

417
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,630
他名下的一架私人飞机曾多次飞抵堪萨斯城
a private plane he owns making numerous trips to Kansas City.

418
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,160
我问过密苏里巴士豪车
And I spoke with Missouri Bus and Limo,

419
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,940
他们负责把中国游客接到你的赌场
which has transported Chinese visitors to your casino.

420
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,710
赛义德女士
Ms. Said--

421
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,520
萨伊德
Sayyad.

422
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,630
萨伊德女士  我回你的电话
Ms. Sayyad, the only reason I returned your call

423
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,570
只是因为你在《电讯报》工作
was because you work for The Telegraph.

424
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,040
我不是每天都能接受你们这种大报的采访
It's not every day that I get a call from a paper as big as yours.

425
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,990
但我不明白你究竟想问什么
But I don't know what you're trying to get at here,

426
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,970
所以如果你不介意
so if you'll excuse--

427
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,350
那雷蒙德·塔斯克呢
What about Raymond Tusk?

428
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,220
他怎么了
What about him?

429
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,800
冯和塔斯克有关系
Feng has ties to Tusk.

430
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,340
塔斯克与总统有关系
Tusk has ties to the president.

431
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,650
你与冯有关系
You have ties to Feng.

432
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,290
这看起来像是外国资金被用来左右政治...
That looks like foreign money being used to influence political--

433
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,460
你所暗示的事不仅失实
What you're insinuating is not only wrong,

434
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,080
更是诽谤
it's libelous.

435
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,710
如果是真的就不是
Not if it's true.

436
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,560
我会毫不犹豫地让我的律师介入
I won't bat an eyelash getting my attorneys involved.

437
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,740
塔斯克也这么威胁我
Tusk made the same threat.

438
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,580
如果一个身家四百亿的人吓不倒我
If a man worth $40 billion doesn't intimidate me,

439
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,400
你也吓不倒我  拉...
you certainly don't, Mr. Lan--

440
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,980
喂
Hello?

441
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,520
他挂断了
He hung up.

442
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,940
我和这完全没关系  雷蒙德
I had nothing to do with it, Raymond.

443
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,020
我在电话这头都闻得到谎言的臭气
I can smell the horseshit through the phone.

444
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,150
你觉得我会冒这么大的险吗
You think I'd put myself at this great a risk?

445
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,690
兔子急了都咬人
Desperate men are capable of anything.

446
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,080
我和你一样希望事情平息
I want it to go away just like you do.

447
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,810
那就让她停手
Then pull her back.

448
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,940
我控制不了媒体  雷蒙德
I have no control over the press, Raymond.

449
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,100
你只会害了你自己  不是我  弗兰克
You'll destroy yourself, Frank, not me.

450
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,400
多谢你多余的忠告
Thank you for that unsolicited advice.

451
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,430
和道尔一起
Work with Doyle,

452
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,810
确保我们没有弱点
make sure we have no weak spots.

453
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,530
我这就打电话给他
I'll call him now.

454
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,710
南茜怎么说
What did Nancy say?

455
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,460
看来杰姬可能和敌人上床了
Well, it looks like Jackie may be sleeping with the enemy.

456
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,570
拉尼根说我们有诽谤的风险没说错
Lanagin is correct in saying we run the risk of libel.

457
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,180
他们之间的联系是有事实依据的
These links are supported by fact.

458
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,170
都是单线  你不能连成圈
Individually, but you can't complete the circle.

459
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,650
我不是说我们要大标题写
I'm not saying the headline should read:

460
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,550
"洗钱黑幕揭秘"  加大惊叹号
Money Laundering Scheme Exposed! Exclamation point.

461
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,300
只是把我们已知的情况原样呈现
Just that we present the landscape as we currently know it.

462
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,130
我们主要是一家财经报纸
We're first and foremost a financial paper.

463
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,000
很多读者都崇拜雷蒙德·塔斯克
Many of our readers worship Raymond Tusk.

464
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,380
那我们就该保护他吗
So we just protect him?

465
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,800
我们不能暗示我们无法证实的联系
We don't insinuate connections we can't back up.

466
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,370
有任何诉讼的机会
If there's any basis for litigation,

467
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,240
他的团队肯定不会放过
you can be sure his team will be aggressive.

468
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,900
他们以前也曾让报社破产
They've bankrupted papers before.

469
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,170
我觉得你应该慢慢来
I think you should slow down and take your time.

470
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,450
什么时候你有了完整的故事
When, and if, you have a story--

471
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,590
马克斯菲尔德先生
Mr. Maxfield,

472
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,440
雷蒙德·塔斯克打电话过来
Raymond Tusk is on the line.

473
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,420
你给他打电话了吗
Did you put in a call to him?

474
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,370
昨天
Yesterday.

475
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,980
他指名要找你  先生
He's specifically asking for you, sir.

476
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,350
我们和拉尼根通话还不到半小时
We got off the phone with Lanagin less than 30 minutes ago.

477
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,680
说明拉尼根立刻打电话给塔斯克了
That means that Tusk was the first call Lanagin made.

478
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,220
告诉他我会打回去
Tell him I'll return.

479
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,590
你联系过白宫了吗
Did you reach out to the White House?

480
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,590
他们在明天总统的新闻发布会前
They're not talking to anyone until after the president

481
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,070
不接受任何采访
does his press briefing tomorrow.

482
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,420
好吧
All right.

483
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,660
把事情再详细给我说一遍
Walk me through all of this again, point by point.

484
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,190
密查姆
Meechum.

485
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,850
我们明天再说  先生
We can talk tomorrow, sir.

486
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,290
不用  怎么了
No. What is it?

487
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,750
我想申请全职做您妻子的安保人员
I'd like to put in a request to be on your wife's detail full-time.

488
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,320
直到死亡威胁消失
At least until the death threats quiet down.

489
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,570
这很体贴
That's very thoughtful.

490
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,490
您不同意我是不会去的  先生
I'll only do it if you approve, sir.

491
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,670
你和克莱尔谈过了吗
Have you spoken to Claire?

492
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,870
她回来的时候说过了  她觉得不错
When she came home. She likes the idea.

493
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,520
那就这样做吧
Then I think we should do it.

494
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,250
我去告诉洛克兰探员
I'll let Agent Rockland know.

495
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,490
抱歉打扰  先生
Sorry for interrupting you, sir.

496
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,060
你没打扰什么
You didn't interrupt anything.

497
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,540
晚安  先生
Good night, sir.

498
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,620
晚安  密查姆
Good night, Meechum.

499
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,010
你肯定猜不到刚才发生了什么
You'll never believe what just happened.

500
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,230
什么
What?

501
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,500
密查姆走进办公室
Meechum came into the office

502
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,140
发现我看的东西
and found me watching something...

503
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,850
不是新闻
...other than the news.

504
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,320
不是吧
Oh, no.

505
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,720
他很懂规矩
He was very professional about it.

506
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,050
-你有没有...  -没有  我只是看而已
- Were you...? - No, no, no. I was just watching.

507
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,080
真是好笑
That's really funny.

508
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,160
你呢  你在看什么
What about you? What are you watching?

509
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,990
康纳给我的视频
The video Connor gave me.

510
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,800
我们第一次竞选州参议员
It's our first state senate race.

511
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,240
我都忘干净了
I forgot about that.

512
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,720
我也是  今早在桌上看到才想起来
So did I, until I found it in the desk this morning.

513
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,710
让我看看
Let me see.

514
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,560
...经历过  就像我
...been there, like I have.

515
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,150
当然  有点德州味儿无伤大雅
Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little Texas in them...

516
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:33,650
-老天  我们当年多年轻  -是啊
- My God, look how young we are. - I know.

517
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,490
大家都很和善  很热情
Everyone here has been so kind, and so welcoming.

518
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,100
过不了多久她就要在克莱姆森扎根了
We'll have her rooting for Clemson before too long.

519
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,930
这我可做不到
That's where I have to draw the line.

520
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,790
你怀念和亚当在一起的日子吗
Do you miss being with Adam?

521
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,700
你怎么提起这个来
Where did that come from?

522
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,550
怀念吗  不
Miss it? No.

523
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,710
你肯定偶尔会怀念的
Well, you must, sometimes.

524
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,320
我有段时间很在乎他
He meant a lot to me for a while.

525
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,960
但都是过去了
But that's done now.

526
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,200
那你呢
What about you?

527
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,610
我什么
What about me?

528
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,860
你觉得不满足吗
Are you unsatisfied?

529
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,920
我们现在要时时处处小心
There's just too much at stake now.

530
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,970
没法信任任何人
No one we can trust.

531
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,970
失去了曾经的自由
We don't have the freedom we once did.

532
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,030
也许这样更好
Maybe it's better this way.

533
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,410
不会分心
No room for distractions.

534
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,890
我不介意牺牲
I don't mind the sacrifice.

535
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,330
我们选择了这个
We chose this instead.

536
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,490
有一件事我们可以达成一致  这儿的肋排更好吃
I think the one thing we can agree on is the ribs here are better.

537
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,410
他就是不把我惹火不罢休
See, he's just trying to get under my skin.

538
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,570
不  根本无可争辩
No, it's not even debatable...

539
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,330
加州之行怎么样
How was California?

540
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,330
很累
Exhausting.

541
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,800
两天里12个活动
12 events in two days.

542
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,560
这是金门吗
Is this the Golden Gate?

543
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,930
对
Yes.

544
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,890
我原来在那里挂了幅未建成的国会大厦蚀刻板画
I had an etching right there of the Capitol before it was finished.

545
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,500
花了85年才完工
Took 85 years to complete it.

546
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,380
这座桥建了多久
How long did it take to complete the bridge.

547
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,090
大概四年
Uh, about four years.

548
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,320
罗斯福第二次就职演说后不久通行
It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.

549
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,920
罗斯福是个能成事的人
That was a man who got things done.

550
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,480
信仰坚定  从不动摇
Strong beliefs. and he stuck to them.

551
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,670
但在必要时也会妥协
But compromised when he had to.

552
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,710
我猜你是来讨论克莱尔的法案的
I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.

553
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,250
那可不是什么闹着玩的项目
It's not a pet project.

554
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,250
两党加起来有三四十个联署人
There are three dozen cosponsors on either side of the aisle.

555
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,590
-这是个严肃的法案  -这我知道
- It's a serious bill. - I don't disagree.

556
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,370
但你不喜欢它的措辞
Except with the language.

557
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,900
我可以解释我的看法
I can explain my thinking,

558
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,740
但恐怕不能说服你
but I doubt I'll convince you anymore--

559
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,980
先不提什么军队尊严
Putting aside the military's honor,

560
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,800
军阶等级  等等一切你珍视的东西
chain of command, all the things that you hold dear...

561
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,900
就考虑一个简单的事实
...let's consider one simple fact.

562
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,780
要不是我  你坐不进这间办公室
You wouldn't have this office if it weren't for me.

563
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,740
我说得很清楚  我不会做傀儡
I made very clear that I wouldn't be a puppet.

564
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,940
我也不是想控制你
I'm not trying to pull strings,

565
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,650
但你好歹表现出一点感激
but you could show a little gratitude.

566
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,980
别的都可以
If it were anything else,

567
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,980
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President...

568
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,530
但这件事不行
but not this.

569
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,560
这件事必然要成功  你至多只会让好事多磨
All you're doing is making the inevitable more difficult.

570
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,040
并非一定会成功  克莱尔还没得到足够的支持
It's not inevitable. Claire doesn't have the votes yet.

571
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,670
你真想在这件事上和我们对着干
You really want to fight us on this.

572
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,420
我一点不想和你对着干
I don't want to fight you at all,

573
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,810
所以才向克莱尔建议  我们坐下来谈谈
which is why I suggested to Claire that we sit down--

574
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,260
我既没有时间  也没有兴趣和你讨价还价
I neither have the time nor the inclination to negotiate with you!

575
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,610
联署法案
Cosponsor the bill,

576
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,890
拉好该死的票
whip the damn votes,

577
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,510
这不是请求
I'm no longer asking.

578
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,400
那我也不会再听了
Then I'm no longer listening.

579
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,510
你该谢我的  可不止这间办公室
You don't have just this office to thank me for.

580
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,420
你如果能连任  还要为那个谢我
If you win reelection, you can thank me for that, too.

581
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,760
那些攻击广告可不是平白无故消失的
Those attack ads didn't just disappear on their own.

582
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,930
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

583
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,720
你去问问雷米·丹顿吧
Why don't you ask Remy Danton.

584
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,250
顺便再问问他雷蒙德·塔斯克的事
And ask him about Raymond Tusk while you're at it.

585
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,000
这样的枕边对话会很有意思
That ought to make for some very interesting pillow talk.

586
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,790
继续好好工作  南茜
You keep up the good work, Nancy.

587
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,700
好的  副总统先生
I will, Mr. Vice President.

588
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,360
真怀念你在身边的日子
I miss having you around,

589
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,140
但现在你是我的眼线
but you're my eyes and ears now,

590
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,470
否则我立马把你要回来
otherwise I'd steal you back in a heartbeat.

591
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,590
谢谢  先生
Well, thank you, sir.

592
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,190
您这么说  对我意义重大
It means a lot to me that you say that.

593
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,000
道格
Doug?

594
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,500
我忙着呢
I'm busy.

595
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,870
报道刚刚见报了
The story just broke.

596
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,190
他们算准了总统的新闻发布会
They timed it with the president's press conference.

597
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,040
帮我转接副总统
Connect me with the vice president.

598
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,020
第七舰队目前部署在关岛附近
So the 7th Fleet is currently positioned near Guam,

599
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,300
如果中国将舰只
where it will remain

600
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:59,640
从日本领海撤出  第七舰队也会原地不动
if China removes its ships from Japan's sovereign waters.

601
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,520
我和御城首相保持着频繁的沟通
I've been in frequent touch with prime minister Oshiro,

602
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,310
也亲自向钱主席发出提议
and have made personal overtures to President Qian.

603
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,740
我对缓解紧张局势持乐观态度
And I remain optimistic that tensions will be quelled

604
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,150
危机不会进一步升级
without any further escalations.

605
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,750
现在我可以回答一些问题
So, with that, I'll take some questions.

606
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,260
亨利  你先来
Henry, you first.

607
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,560
您可以对《华尔街电讯报》的报道发表评论吗
Can you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article--

608
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,410
我来之前才刚知道这件事
I was just notified of that moments before I joined you.

609
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,150
我还没来得及看呢  简
I haven't had a chance to read it yet. Yeah, Jane?

610
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,040
总统先生
Mr. President,

611
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,310
您能给我们讲一下您和雷蒙德·塔斯克的关系吗
would you walk us through your history with Raymond Tusk?

612
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,460
我是来回答关于中日关系的问题的  马克
I'm here to answer questions on Sino-Japanese relations. Mark?

613
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,300
报道中提到冯山德
The article mentions Xander Feng,

614
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,900
一位富有而有影响力的中国商人
a wealthy and influential Chinese businessman --

615
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,190
除非问题与我刚刚的声明有关
Unless this has to do with the statement I just made...

616
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,430
的确有关  总统先生
It does, Mr. President.

617
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,180
冯和常委有联系
Feng has ties to the standing committee

618
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,030
而我们目前和中国陷入僵局
and we're currently in a standoff with the Chinese.

619
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,820
-经济上  -非常感谢各位
- Economically - Thank you all very much.

620
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,570
我并不怕这故事的开端
It's not beginning the story that I fear,

621
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,790
我怕的是不知道结局将如何
it's not knowing how it will end.

622
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,920
现在人人都是靶子了
Everyone is fair game now,

623
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,840
我也是
including me.

624
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,490
这完全在意料之中
This is par for the course,

625
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,680
我们已经发现沃克总统就是如此
for what we've come to expect from President Walker.

626
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,480
如果他想卖出一辆新车
Whenever he's selling a shiny new car,

627
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,930
他就滔滔不绝
he can't say enough about it.

628
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,040
引擎坏了
The engine breaks down,

629
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,510
变速器不好使了
the transmission gives out,

630
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,610
他就开始闪烁其词  无视保修
he dodges, he ignores the warranty.

631
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,920
我来告诉你们
I'm gonna tell you something,

632
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,060
我们的保修单叫做美国宪法
our warranty is the constitution of the United States,

633
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,570
这张保修单是没有限制条件的
and there's no limit on that.

634
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,110
他得好好看看宪法
He needs to read the fine print

635
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,510
并且开始回答我们的问题
and start answering our questions.

636
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,820
如果这里确有属实的内容
If any of this is true,

637
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,390
那么就是国会  白宫
we're talking Congress, the White House,

638
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,840
以及两党都算上
both parties...

639
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,540
我是说如果
Now, I'm saying "If,"

640
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,160
但如果这钱看起来像赃款
but when it looks like dirty money,

641
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,590
闻上去也像赃款
and it smells like dirty money,

642
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,380
那肯定有人手上沾着脏东西
somebody has probably got dirt under their nails.

643
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,430
并没有证据表明洗钱活动确实...
Look, there's no real proof this money laundering is even--

644
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,760
可这其中的联系令人担忧
The connections are troubling,

645
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,170
尤其是安德伍德
especially Underwood.

646
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,290
阿道希资助民主党期间
He was the House whip the entire time Adohi were

647
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,450
他一直是党鞭
contributing to the Democrats,

648
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,700
现在他在总统身边工作
and he's working side by side with the president now.

649
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,830
总统  这事能一路牵连到白宫吗
The president. So this goes all the way to the White House?

650
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,360
-有可能啊  -这只是假设
- It might. - It's hypothetical.

651
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,870
而且  你为了证实说法  证据都是挑拣过的
And by the way, you've cherry-picked the facts to make your case.

652
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,150
我没有什么说法
I'm not making a case.

653
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,550
我的标题是《政治行动委员会资金引起质疑》
My headline is: PAC Money Raises Questions.

654
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,510
也确实有疑问
And it has.

655
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,160
我并没有给出答案
I haven't answered those questions,

656
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,220
但我觉得美国人民应该知道答案  你觉得呢
but I think the American people deserve answers. Don't you?

657
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,850
司法部长
You can bet your bottom dollar

658
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,800
百分之百会介入调查
the attorney general is gonna investigate.

659
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,050
这事已经在媒体上引起了轩然大波
With the firestorm this is causing in the media--

660
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,100
我们该怎么办
What's our course of action?

661
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,870
作为您的法律顾问  我建议您
As your counsel, I would encourage you

662
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,160
在有更多消息之前不要和媒体接触
not to speak to the press until we have more information.

663
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,180
但作为普通公民
As your average citizen,

664
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,380
您等的越久  看起来就越可疑
the longer you wait, the more suspicious it looks.

665
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,660
如果有任何的违规行为
If there's been any irregularity,

666
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,860
都与我没有关系
I had nothing to do with it.

667
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,570
您和塔斯克的友谊
Your friendship with Tusk

668
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,690
会让您因关连而被认为有罪
implies guilt by association.

669
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,670
那么我们现在是做有罪推定了吗
Are we presuming guilt before innocence?

670
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,710
我是个律师
I'm a lawyer,

671
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,910
我不做任何假设
I presume nothing.

672
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,500
但是舆论可没有法律学位
But public opinion doesn't have a law degree.

673
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,810
让我们单独说两句
Give us a few moments.

674
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,040
我必须建议您  如果我不在场
I have to advise you not to have any conversation

675
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,800
不要和任何人讨论这件事
about this matter without me present.

676
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,590
我了解你的建议了
Your advisement has been noted.

677
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,110
我就在门口
I'll be right outside.

678
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,180
这就是你一直没和我说的事吗
Is this what you were keeping from me?

679
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,970
我们应该遵照您法律顾问的建议  不应该...
We should follow your counsel's advice, and not --

680
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,100
告诉我  钱的事是不是真的
Tell me if it's true, about the money.

681
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,580
比尔不在房间里  我们可能出现各种...
With Bill out of the room, we open ourselves up to all sort of--

682
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,600
该死  弗兰克  这事我已经被瞒得太久了
Damn it, Frank! I've been in the dark too long on this.

683
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,110
到此为止了
That ends now.

684
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,230
我不知道任何细节
I don't know any details.

685
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,750
冯说如果大桥的项目通过
Feng told me if the Bridge project got approved,

686
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,320
给共和党的资金就会断流
the GOP would stop getting money.

687
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,720
我们批准了项目  资金就停了
We approved it, the money stopped.

688
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,500
老天爷  这样白宫和钱就有直接联系了
Jesus Christ, that connects the White House directly to the money.

689
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,680
不是这样的
No, sir.

690
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,920
您什么都不知道  过去是  现在也是
You knew nothing, you still know nothing.

691
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,550
如果司法部发现任何确凿证据证明外来资金...
If the DOJ finds any concrete evidence of foreign money--

692
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,890
那是雷蒙德·塔斯克的问题
That's Raymond Tusk's head,

693
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,570
不是您的  您什么都没做错
not yours. You've done nothing wrong.

694
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,670
牵连罪  弗兰克  你也听到了
Guilt by association, Frank. You heard the man.

695
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,560
如果司法部进行调查  只会证明您是无罪的
If the DOJ investigates, it will only prove your innocence.

696
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,350
没有人能从这种事中全身而退
Nobody walks away from something like this without bruises.

697
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,760
但伤不致命
Well, bruises you can survive.

698
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,370
只是不知事到如今要如何避免受牵连
I just don't know how we can avoid it at this point.

699
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,030
如果您想加快进程  平息此事
Unless you want to accelerate the process and get rid of it.

700
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,620
我们可以让司法部长任命一名特别检察官
We could always have the attorney general appoint a special prosecutor

701
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,100
这主意太糟了
That's a terrible idea.

702
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,500
可能是
Maybe so.

703
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,850
鉴于我们现在的情况  弗兰克
And given where we are, Frank,

704
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,710
我不是很想接受你的建议
I'm not inclined to follow your suggestions.

705
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,250
我不是说您该这么做
Well, I wasn't suggesting it as something you should do.

706
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,400
只是提出一种可能
Just as a possibility.

707
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,290
其实  我觉得您不该这么做
No, in fact, I --I don't think you should.

708
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,170
我觉得这种事拖得越久越好
I think it's better to drag these things out as long as possible.

709
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,640
让公众对这个话题产生厌烦
Let the public fatigue on it.

710
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,660
直到中期选举都一直对我们构成威胁吗
And have it hanging over our heads until the midterms?

711
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,670
热度会消退的
It'll lose steam.

712
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,650
如果没有怎么办
What if it doesn't.

713
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,150
国防部提出要对中国南海发起
I've got the Pentagon proposing tactical drone strikes

714
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,100
战术性无人机袭击
in the South China Sea.

715
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,500
我不能好几个月纠缠在这种事里
I can't be dealing with something like this for months on end.

716
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,350
也许您说得对  是该任命个特别检察官
Maybe you're right then. A special prosecutor is the way to go.

717
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,380
我没那么说  是你说的
I didn't say that, you did.

718
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
不  我只是说让您摆脱这个问题的纠缠
Oh, no. I just meant in terms of getting it off your plate.

719
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,640
如果你及时汇报情况  我就不会有这个问题了
It wouldn't be on my plate if you kept me better informed.

720
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,420
我一直是在帮您撇清干系  先生
I have done nothing but try to insulate you, sir.

721
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,810
刚刚媒体对我的攻击叫撇清干系吗
Is that what you call the feeding frenzy I just went through?

722
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,880
我向您郑重承诺  总统先生
I make this solemn promise to you, Mr. President.

723
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,950
如果走到那一步  我会承担罪责
I will take the fall if it comes to that,

724
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,680
但不会的
but it won't.

725
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,530
无论您打算如何处理
However you decide to deal with this,

726
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,490
我认为您的直觉是对的
I think your instincts are right.

727
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,040
我们或许不该指派特别检察官
We probably shouldn't involve a special prosecutor.

728
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,840
让比尔回来
Send Bill back in.

729
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,280
你知道这事
You knew about this.

730
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,250
塔斯克是我的客户
Tusk is a client,

731
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,530
-但我不是什么都知道  -胡说
- doesn't mean I know everything-- - Bullshit.

732
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,840
你之所以能成为格兰顿-希尔的合伙人
The reason you're a partner at Glendon Hill

733
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,150
就是因为你知道内幕
is because you know the things nobody else does.

734
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,400
你想让我说什么
What do you want me to say?

735
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,900
是真的吗
Is it true?

736
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,010
我们不谈公事
We don't talk about work.

737
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,180
我们没在床上
We're not in bed,

738
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,940
而是在我的办公室
we're in my fucking office.

739
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,040
在这里
And in here,

740
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,150
你为弗兰克卖命
you work for Frank.

741
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,900
我只为我自己卖命
I work for no one but myself.

742
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,940
继续自欺欺人吧
Keep telling yourself that.

743
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,090
不像你  我不把自己
Unlike you, I don't peddle my goods

744
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,470
卖给出价最高的人
for whoever can pay the highest retainer.

745
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,550
我是很多老大的走狗
I'm the bitch to a lot of top dogs,

746
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,230
我自己很清楚也很情愿
I'm fully aware and willing,

747
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,360
但你比我更糟
but you're worse.

748
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,180
你就是弗兰克的走狗  还拒不相信
You're Frank's bitch and refuse to believe it.

749
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,630
不是这样
That's not true.

750
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,860
被我戳中了
Case in fucking point.

751
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,840
别转移话题  你知道这笔钱却没有告诉我
Don't turn this. You knew about the money and you didn't tell me.

752
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,030
尽管这事会动摇我的职位
Even though it's thrown my seat into contention.

753
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,200
就算钱的事属实
Let's say there was money,

754
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,700
我也确实知道
and let's say I did know,

755
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,920
又能怎么样
what good would it have done?

756
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,150
这说明你不惜看着我输
It means you were willing to watch me lose!

757
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,440
我只是在尊重你提出的界限
It means I respected the boundaries that you demanded.

758
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,780
-不改变关系  没有特殊待遇  -这事不一样
- No changes, no special treatment. - This is different!

759
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,130
现在还要开特例了吗
So now we're making exceptions?

760
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,570
这么重要的事情当然算特例
When it's this important, yes!

761
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,270
鱼和熊掌不可兼得
You can't have it both ways.

762
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,410
你是不是...
Were you...?

763
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,320
我什么
Was I what?

764
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,320
为了打探弗兰克的消息才上我
...fucking me to get info on Frank?

765
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,650
你这么想吗
Is that what you think?

766
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,490
我不知道该怎么想
I don't know what to think.

767
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,290
我对你的关心已经太多了
I care about you more than I should,

768
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,790
但我厌倦了总要一遍遍地说
but I'm getting tired of having to say it.

769
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,470
他被转移到一家联邦精神病院做评估
He's being moved to a federal psychiatric facility for assessment.

770
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,990
正式判刑前待在高警戒的拘留中心
then a high-security detention center until the official sentencing.

771
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,790
这是个好消息
Well, that's good to hear.

772
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,420
坏消息是  我们希望您近期不要公开活动
The bad news is we don't want you doing any public events for a while.

773
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,610
我的法案马上要表决了
My bill is about to go to the floor.

774
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,500
我必须公开露面
I need to have a public profile.

775
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,560
对您的死亡威胁越来越多
Your death threats continue to rise.

776
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,900
我们冒不起这个险
We can't take the risk.

777
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,900
我都不能离开家了吗
Am I even allowed to leave the house?

778
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,530
当然可以  但我们希望您避开人群
Of course. But we want you to avoid large crowds.

779
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,140
我们保护您的能力
Our ability to protect--

780
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,530
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

781
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,350
出什么事了
Anything wrong?

782
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,890
我们正在跟安德伍德夫人汇报她的新安保规程
We were just briefing Mrs. Underwood on her new security protocol.

783
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,180
我们待会儿再说行吗
Can we actually finish this later?

784
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,310
当然可以
Of course.

785
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,730
怎么样
How did it go?

786
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,320
他起了疑心
He's skeptical.

787
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,820
要我给特莉莎打电话吗
Should I call Tricia?

788
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,230
不  不能让他觉得我在他背后捣鬼
No. It could look like I was trying to go behind his back.

789
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,260
我们只需要静观其变
We'll just have to wait and see.

790
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,590
我要说的都说了
I made my case.

791
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,260
希望他不会同意
Hopefully, he'll disagree with it.

792
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,500
但这可能是招错棋
But this could've been the wrong move.

793
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,430
不要怀疑你自己
Well, don't doubt yourself.

794
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,250
赛斯在过去六小时里收到了三千余封电子邮件
Seth has gotten over 3,000 e-mails in the last six hours.

795
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,650
电话被打爆了
The phones are overloaded.

796
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,300
你要完全无视吗
So you ignore all that?

797
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,140
我不能无视司法部
I can't ignore the Department of Justice.

798
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,550
我能做什么
What can I do?

799
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,030
等我进了监狱来探视我
Come and visit me when I'm in prison.

800
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,360
你不非得站在门口
You don't have to stand by that door.

801
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,580
放松会儿吧
Take a load off.

802
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,280
谢谢  先生  但我应该站着
Thank you, sir, but I'm supposed to stay on my feet.

803
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,520
你不说我也不说
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

804
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,000
要是有人为这个找你麻烦
And if anybody gives you any trouble about this,

805
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,810
或是为任何事找你麻烦
or anything,

806
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,660
他们可以来找我
they can talk to me.

807
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,440
夜晚真美
Beautiful night.

808
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,400
是啊  先生
Yes, sir.

809
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,450
这几天你不在身边的感觉真有点怪呢
It's been strange not having you around these last few days.

810
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,320
您要我回到您的安保队伍中吗
You want me to switch back to your detail?

811
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,480
不  你跟克莱尔在一起我很欣慰
No, no. I'm glad you're with Claire.

812
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,720
只是你走了我才发觉
I just didn't realize how much

813
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,150
我有多习惯你在我身边
I got used to your company until you were gone.

814
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,220
在我心中保护她和保护您是一回事
Protecting her is the same as protecting you in my mind.

815
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,660
喝吧
Oh, come on.

816
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,350
你为什么要做这个
Why do you do this?

817
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,400
做什么  先生
Do what, sir?

818
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,650
这一直让我感到敬畏
I've always been awestruck.

819
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,540
竟然会有人愿意为别人挡子弹
People who are willing to take a bullet for someone else.

820
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,700
这是我为国家服务的方式
It's how I serve my country.

821
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,770
为国家服务的方式有很多种
Well, there's a lotta ways to serve your country.

822
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,020
这就是我的方式
And this is my way.

823
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,290
这瓶我还没喝完呢
Oh, I haven't finished with this one yet.

824
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,610
不是给你的
It's not for you.

825
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,880
我执勤的时候不能喝酒  夫人
I can't drink on duty, ma'am.

826
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,520
也不是给你的
It's not for you either.

827
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,790
好啦  过来一起聊聊
Well, come on over and join the party.

828
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,320
你还没看腻我的脸吗
Haven't you got sick of seeing my face yet?

829
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,820
永远不会  夫人
Never, ma'am.

830
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,710
敬密查姆
To Meechum,

831
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,260
敬他的忠诚与服务
for his loyalty and service.

832
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,420
敬艾德华
To Edward.

833
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,340
我在去我律师办公室的路上  雷米
I'm on my way to my lawyer's office, Remy.

834
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,390
平常这时候我已经睡了  我并不想去那地方
That's not where I want to be when I'd usually be in bed.

835
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,900
我无法阻止弗兰克泄露消息
I can't stop Frank from leaking things.

836
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,640
是啊  但你可以让他比我们更遭罪
No, but you can make sure he suffers more than us.

837
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,000
我说"我们"  雷米
And I say "us," Remy,

838
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
是因为现在你也脱不了干系了
because your skin is in this game now, too.

839
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,100
你准备否认吗
Are you gonna deny?

840
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,740
我当然要否认
Of course I'm gonna deny.

841
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,610
这件事每个步骤都是合法的
Every step of this was legal.

842
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,430
他们无法证明其中的联系
They can't prove the links between them.

843
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,890
拉尼根那边呢
What about Lanagin?

844
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,350
他会合作的  我们要担心的是冯
He'll cooperate. It's Feng we need to worry about.

845
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,630
我想个办法联系他
I'll find a way to get in touch with him.

846
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,140
我们还有一项优势
We do have one major advantage.

847
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,590
公众可以恨我
The public can hate me,

848
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:49,910
但只要克雷顿-维斯特还在盈利
but as long as Clayton West remains profitable,

849
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,870
我的股东们就不会在乎
my stockholders won't care.

850
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,460
弗兰克可不行
Frank doesn't have the same liberty.

851
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,150
公众舆论就可以毁了他
Public opinion can demolish him.

852
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,680
你得确保事态会这样发展
You need to make sure that happens.

853
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,310
我可以跟共和党人一起想办法
I can work with the Republicans on that.

854
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,750
我们也会遭人仔细审视
Well, we'll be under the magnifying glass too.

855
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,970
这会变成一场政治迫害
This will be a witch hunt.

856
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,310
那我会让他们抓到该抓的人
I'll make sure that they pick the right targets.

857
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,200
你要攻击领导层
What you need to do is go after the leadership.

858
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,040
让他们受苦
Make them hurt.

859
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,450
他们会为了自救背叛弗兰克
They'll turn on Frank to save themselves.

860
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,290
博奇  乌麦克  夏普
Birch, Womack, Sharp.

861
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,850
特别是杰姬·夏普
Especially Jackie Sharp.

862
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,040
她是他钦点的人
She's his chosen one.

863
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,910
雷米
Remy?

864
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,440
我听着呢
I heard you.

865
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,240
我这就行动
I got my marching orders.

866
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,650
就看你的了
I'm counting on you.

867
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,610
一定不辱使命
I'll deliver.

868
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,720
我们明早再谈
Let's talk in the morning.

869
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,520
我最看好的两个人是
The two names I like the most

870
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,310
贾斯汀·盖因斯和希瑟·邓巴
are Justin Gaines and Heather Dunbar.

871
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,670
盖因斯的资历更高
Gaines has better credentials.

872
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,360
但他跟政府关系太近
But he's close to the administration.

873
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,640
如果不是共和党阻挠
I would've made him a federal judge

874
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,930
我已经让他做联邦法官了
if the GOP hadn't blocked it.

875
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,120
这一点很重要
That's an important point.

876
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,180
邓巴很勇敢  她绝对可以胜任
Dunbar's got grit. She's more than qualified.

877
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,300
而且没有负担
And there's no baggage there.

878
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,750
但她更难以捉摸
But she's more unpredictable.

879
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,270
如果司法部长认为她是个未知数
Well, I doubt the attorney general would have put her on his list

880
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,640
也不会把她提上名单了
if he thought she was a wild card.

881
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,010
先生  我必须说
Sir, I have to say,

882
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,060
我认为这一步时机不到
I think this step is premature.

883
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,830
我们该缓缓  看看司法部自己采取什么行动
We should hold off and see what the DOJ does on its own.

884
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,870
我不想这么做  比尔
I don't want to do it, Bill

885
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,920
但我的担心是
But my fear is this.

886
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,620
如果我们等着水从热升至沸腾
If we wait until the water goes from hot to boiling,

887
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,520
会显得我们太被动了  缺乏积极性
we seem reactionary, not proactive.

888
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,180
但积极也可能显得防御性太强
But proactive could also seem defensive.

889
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,140
就像嫌疑人在别人问之前就大喊
Like the suspect that screams "I didn't do it"

890
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,220
不是我干的
before anyone asks.

891
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,920
除此之外  我们根本没时间做准备
Aside from that, we simply haven't had time to prepare.

892
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,870
也许等几礼拜
Maybe wait a couple of weeks.

893
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,890
那就达不到目的了
That defeats the purpose.

894
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:19,660
那就等几天
Then a few days.

895
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,780
我要选邓巴
I'd like to go with Dunbar.

896
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,470
-先生  -我决定了
- Sir-- - I've made my decision.

897
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,890
比尔  请你将我的意思转达给司法部长
Bill, I'd like you to convey my wishes to the attorney general.

898
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,600
最终还是得由他决定
Ultimately, the decision is his.

899
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,380
我们不能给他施压
We can't appear to be pressuring him.

900
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,350
当然了
Of course not.

901
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,710
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

902
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,780
唯一比说服别人按我的意愿做事
The only thing more satisfying than

903
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,560
更让我感到满足的
convincing someone to do what I want,

904
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,930
就是故意没能说服他们
is failing to persuade them on purpose.

905
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,470
就像"禁止进入"标志
It's like a "Do Not Enter" Sign,

906
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,460
简直就是在求你走进去
it just begs you to walk through the door.

907
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,730
道尔对我们的初步背景调查已经进行过半了
Doyle's about halfway through our initial background check.

908
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,570
每位捐赠人
Every donor,

909
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,700
每次政治活动
every political event.

910
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,420
邓巴可能调查的每件事
Everything that Dunbar might be looking into.

911
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,470
很好  赛斯呢
Good. Seth?

912
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,600
我们要避免做任何正式声明
We avoid any official statement,

913
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,990
听总统的指令
follow the president's cue.

914
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,850
同时  我想打几个非正式电话
In the meantime, I'd like to make some off the record calls.

915
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,030
透露说你乐于接受调查
You welcome the investigation,

916
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,270
这样做是对的  等等
it's the right step, et cetera.

917
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,650
让民众了解你的个人看法
Give folks the personal touch.

918
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,810
没问题  只要不显得我们防御性太强
That's fine, as long as we don't come off defensive.

919
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,620
让我看看你要给谁打电话
I'd like to see a list of who you'd be calling.

920
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,910
有些人可能会很忙
Some of this is gonna be on the fly,

921
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,220
如果能让我自由发挥会更好
it'd be great if I had a little leeway.

922
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,610
让赛斯干他的  道尔的事就够你忙的了
Let Seth do his thing, you'll have your hands full with Doyle.

923
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,610
我事后告诉你我都打给谁了
I'll let you know who I've called.

924
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,910
好了  工作去吧
All right, let's get to work.

925
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,710
先生
Sir?

926
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,510
什么事
Yes, what is it?

927
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,410
我知道你要委派任务
I understand that you need to delegate,

928
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,370
但你当着赛斯的面反驳我
but when you contradict me in front of Seth,

929
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,040
会削弱我对他的控制
it compromises my authority over him.

930
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,150
你不能事事管着他  我们要忙的事很多
You can't micromanage, we have too much to do.

931
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,320
赛斯还是我们团队里的新人
Seth is still new to the team.

932
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,640
我要确保他在好好完成任务
I need to make sure that he's doing his job properly.

933
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,990
我觉得他在好好做
Well, I think he is.

934
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,220
我是你的故障保险  先生
I am your failsafe, sir.

935
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,860
但如果你不让我这么做  我就没办法了
But I can't be that if you won't let me.

936
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,590
是吗  道格  你是我的故障保险吗
Are you, Doug? My failsafe?

937
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,350
你还怀疑这点吗
Do you doubt that?

938
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,040
我们正在全速飞向一场飓风
We're flying full throttle into a hurricane,

939
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,870
你却在谈办公室政治
and you're talking office politics

940
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,390
而不是集中全力确保我们不会被搞垮
instead of focusing on making sure we don't get ripped apart.

941
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,090
你说得对  先生  我不该提这事
You're right, sir. I shouldn't have brought it up.

942
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,510
她还在那里吗
Is she still there?

943
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,160
在  我告诉她我去散个步
Yeah. I told her I was going for a walk.

944
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,880
道格  我知道你说过你想让她走
Look, Doug, I know you said you wanted her gone,

945
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,320
但你要理解  我只求...
but you have to understand that all I'm asking is --

946
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,340
她可以留下来
She can stay.

947
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,030
什么
What?

948
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,010
她不一定得走  她可以留下来
She doesn't have to leave. She can stay.

949
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,590
我相信你知道分寸
I trust you to be smart.

950
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,880
你能读书给我听吗
Will you read to me?

951
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,290
我的《圣经》在屋里
My bible is inside.

952
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:27,700
不非得是《圣经》
Doesn't have to be the bible.

953
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,220
随便找点你手机上的
Just pull up something on your phone.

954
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,880
比如什么
Like what?

955
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,670
《双城记》  我妈妈以前会念给我听
Tale of Two Cities. My mom used to read it to me.

956
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,920
那是最美好的时代
It was the best of times,

957
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,320
那是最糟糕的时代
it was the worst of times,

958
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,170
那是智慧的年头
it was the age of wisdom,

959
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,970
那是愚昧的年头
it was the age of foolishness,

960
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,500
那是信仰的纪元
it was the epoch of belief,

it was the epoch of incredulity,

那是光明的季节
it was the season of Light,

那是黑暗的季节
it was the season of Darkness,

964
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,040
那是希望的春天
it was the spring of hope,

965
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,800
那是绝望的冬天
the winter of despair,

966
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,020
我们拥有一切
we had everything before us,

967
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,200
我们一无所有
we had nothing before us,

968
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,560
我们都将直奔天堂
we were all going direct to Heaven,

969
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,500
我们都将直落地狱
we were all going direct the other way."

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}本集一开始  一个反堕胎者试图袭击克莱尔
美国建国早期  除了一些法律禁止销售能够引起晚期流产的药物之外
堕胎行为是允许的
自从1821年康涅狄格州第一个通过了禁止堕胎的法律后
其它各州也纷纷仿效
联邦政府也在1883年通过了禁止传播避孕和堕胎工具  药物
和信息的"康斯托克法"
在1973年1月22日最高法院公布"罗诉韦德案"判决结果之前
除非妊娠威胁到孕妇的生命安全  堕胎在美国全境都是非法的

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}1973年  美国最高法院9名大法官
以7比2判定德克萨斯州的堕胎禁令违宪
判决书指出  个人隐私是受到宪法保护的
而在这种保护之下  女性有自主选择是否终止妊娠的权利
这便是美国司法历史上著名的"罗诉韦德案"
这个判决并没有给关于堕胎的争论画上句号
在过去41年中  围绕着这一判决的斗争从未停止过
包括堕胎权和生育权在内的女性权益问题
不仅引起了美国社会的广泛关注和讨论
还在美国的党派政治斗争和总统选举中扮演了重要的角色

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}在美国的政治光谱中  左翼民主党多是支持堕胎的"选择派"
而共和党所代表的右翼保守力量多是反对堕胎的"生命派"
每年在"罗诉韦德案"宣判的纪念日
都会有"生命派"活动人士在华盛顿进行名为"生命进军"的大规模集会
2007年  美国最高法院判定
小布什政府的"晚期堕胎禁令"没有违反宪法
民意调查显示  目前在美国
大多数人(52%)反对不加限制的无条件堕胎
只有26%的人认为在任何情况下都可以堕胎
有20%认为任何情况下都不可以堕胎
