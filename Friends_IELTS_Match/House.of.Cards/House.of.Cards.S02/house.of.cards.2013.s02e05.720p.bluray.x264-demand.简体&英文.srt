"考虑"  我以为大桥的事已经定了

133
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,550
没什么是确定的

134
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,630
这座大桥是首要任务

我们这次会面就是为了讨论

150
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,940
自由浮动汇率是大势所趋
A free-floating currency is inevitable.

151
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,080
这下我有下手的空间了
Now I have something I can work with.

152
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,200
为什么突然改变主意
Why the sudden change of heart?

153
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,030
并不突然  只是我们这些有远见的人
Not sudden, it has taken those of us who are more forward-thinking

154
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,990
花了很多年才说服其他同僚
many years to convince our counterparts.

155
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,280
那中国直接执行就得了
But China could just do it.

156
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,580
你我都清楚  你们不需要世贸组织的裁定
I mean, you know as well as I, you don't require a WTO ruling.

157
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
就像你说的  得走过场
Appearances, as you say.

158
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,820
一定要看起来像是受美国逼迫
It's important that it looks like America forced us out,

159
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,870
而不是我们主动投降
not that we gave in.

160
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,230
那我需要时间
Well, I'll need a little more time,

161
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,180
去和总统商量
so that I can brief the President.

162
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,370
我会耐心等待
I'm here for as long as necessary.

163
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,300
无论你要找谁商量
However you would like to communicate,

164
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,320
我都不管
I leave that to you.

165
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,400
谢谢  副总统先生
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

166
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,650
谢谢  冯先生
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

167
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,860
在加夫尼我们有自己的外交特色
In Gaffney we had our own brand of diplomacy:

168
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,650
一边握手言欢  一边做好准备
Shake with your right hand, but hold a rock in your left.

169
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,620
看看是谁困在这儿了
Well, look who got stuck with the pool.

170
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,120
我们来这儿简直是找虐
We volunteered because we hate ourselves.

171
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,570
南方前线一切顺利吧
All's well on the Southern front?

172
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,610
没新闻就是没新闻
No news is no news.

173
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,910
我听说那里还有火枪呢
Come on. I hear there's muskets out there.

174
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,540
你什么时候能给我们点猛料
When you giving us something real?

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,520
我们正身处美丽的斯波特瑟尔韦尼亚
We're here in beautiful Spotsylvania, aren't we?

176
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,950
不过是给成年人玩玩具枪找借口
This is dress-up for grown men with toy guns.

177
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,710
听起来可以写上五百字
Sounds like 500 words to me.

178
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,270
告诉杜兰特除非我们在世贸撤诉
Tell Durant that China won't discuss the bridge

179
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,130
否则中国不愿意谈大桥
unless we drop the WTO suit.

180
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,540
你不是说他们不希望撤诉吗
I thought you said they want to keep it.

181
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,440
冯希望  说明塔斯克希望
Feng does, which means Tusk does.

182
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,010
但我们不知道北京是不是希望
But we don't know if Beijing does.

183
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,730
你觉得冯在撒谎
You think Feng's lying?

184
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,670
开放汇率会导致利率市场化
An open currency could free up interest rates,

185
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,920
减小中国的通货膨胀
reduce inflation in China.

186
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
他们两人都能受益
They'd both profit.

187
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,090
如果他们或者我们将了北京的军
If they're forcing Beijing's hand, or we are,

188
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,080
可能在峰会引起混乱
that could throw the Summit into chaos.

189
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,430
正是  冯可能有后台支持
Exactly. Look, Feng may well have support,

190
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,570
但我猜常委会有分歧
but my guess is that the Standing Committee's divided.

191
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,370
不管怎样  我们打他们个措手不及
Either way, we'll throw 'em off balance.

192
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,630
凯茜一宣布  我们就放出撤诉的风声
Let's leak we're dropping the suit as soon as Cathy presents it.

193
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,270
只是诉讼吗  不漏点别的什么
Just the lawsuit? Nothing else in the leak?

194
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,670
暗示与冯有关  但别点名
A hint of Feng, but no names.

195
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,380
让消息传一阵子再说
Let's let this grow on its own.

196
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,200
这回怎样
How was that?

197
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,510
好多了
Much better.

198
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,790
我感觉不错  你怎么看
I feel good. What do you think?

199
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,770
我看你准备好了
I think you're ready.

200
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,090
代码还得准备多久
How long on the code?

201
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,800
只差几个漏洞了
Just a couple of bugs to work out.

202
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,830
我说明天或周三我就能回去
I told them tomorrow or Wednesday.

203
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,860
活儿还没完
Work's not done.

204
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,050
我要是再往后推  你不觉得别人会奇怪吗
If I postpone again, don't you think it'll draw attention? I --

205
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,280
等完事了也就没事了
It'll be done when it's done.

206
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,860
漏洞修复了我就给你发邮件
I'll email you when the bugs are fixed.

207
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,940
挑一个公开的场所  约好时间给你
Somewhere public, a place and time.

208
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,510
你真想这么做吗
Hey, are you sure you wanna do this?

209
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,620
我明白风险多大
I understand the risks.

210
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,830
你自以为明白而已
Well, you think you do.

211
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,320
我也不是头回身陷险境了
This isn't the first time I've been in danger.

212
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,790
是吗  在《先驱报》被纸割伤过手吗
Oh, yeah? Paper cuts at The Herald?

213
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,590
死亡威胁  我揭露了一个特区贩毒集团
Death threats. When I exposed a drug ring in D.C.

214
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,840
我读过你写的报道
You know, I read the articles.

215
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,830
那根本不算什么
That's small time.

216
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,720
我差点就接受司法保护了
I almost had to go into protection.

217
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,350
这可是联调局  不是什么街警
This is the FBI. It's not a few street cops.

218
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
你觉得自己反抗当局
You think you're badass because

219
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,610
就是个了不得的义士吗
you're on some vigilante anarchy kick?

220
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,740
起码我有胆子在报道上署上真实姓名
At least I have the balls to put my name on the work I do.

221
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,680
但你没面临过几百年的刑罚
You've never faced a hundred years in prison,

222
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,240
你这自以为是的混蛋
you self-righteous prick.

223
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,710
我大多数朋友被关起来  永远出不来
Most of my friends are locked up and rotting away

224
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,480
就因为他们太多次以身犯险
'cause they poked the bear one too many times.

225
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,610
为什么  因为他们想揭露政府的监控项目
Why? They wanted to expose government surveillance,

226
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,850
棱镜计划  挪用公款  滥用职权  酷刑和欺骗
the PRISM program, embezzlement, abuse, fucking torture, lies.

227
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,990
你是个记者有什么了不起  我们是战士
You're a journalist. Who gives a shit? We're fucking soldiers.

228
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,890
这已经是我生活的一部分了
It's personal for me now.

229
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,480
我没选择了  但你还有
I don't have a choice, but you still do.

230
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,320
我也没选择了
I don't have a choice.

231
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,220
消息从哪来
Where did you get this?

232
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,850
你可以说消息源与中国代表团关系密切
You could say a source close to the Chinese delegation.

233
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,620
给我个名字
Give me a name.

234
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,300
我只知道是一个中国商人
All I know is that it's a Chinese businessman

235
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,040
和常委会关系非同一般  在峰会上进行秘密外交
with ties to the Standing Committee back-channeling the Summit.

236
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,290
-他人在华盛顿吗  -我不知道
- In Washington? - I don't know.

237
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,070
-在和谁接触  -这我也不知道
- With who? - I don't know that either.

238
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,960
如果我去问贸易代表处  他们会证实吗
If I call the USTR's office, they'll confirm?

239
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,830
我知道多少  就告诉了你多少
I'm telling you as much as I know.

240
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,410
你为什么要告诉我
Why are you telling me this at all?

241
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,280
反正明天他们也会把消息放出去
They're going public with it tomorrow anyway.

242
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,520
不如让你抢先发布
You might as well get the scoop.

243
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,550
为什么挑中我
Why me, specifically?

244
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,960
内战重演的报道配不上你这样的记者
You deserve better than a Civil War reenactment.

245
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,560
别装做你突然变成圣诞老人了
Please don't pretend you've suddenly become Santa Claus.

246
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,510
我现在帮你的忙  也许你会承我的情
I give you something now, maybe you'll remember.

247
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,730
将来有一天或许用得上
It's an investment in the future.

248
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,500
我可不太喜欢卖人情
I'm not big on favors.

249
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,310
所以我说了"也许"
I just said "maybe."

250
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,490
马上给我接贸易代表处
Connect me to the USTR's office.

251
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,390
越过新闻发言人
Skip the Press Secretary.

252
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,430
跟他们说我想问世贸组织诉讼的事
Tell them I want to talk about the WTO suit.

253
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,570
你跟谁说了
Who did you speak to?

254
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,580
康纳  他在向艾拉·萨伊德泄露消息
Connor. He's talking to Ayla Sayyad.

255
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,950
你透给他多少
How much did you fill him in?

256
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,530
没说多少
The bare minimum.

257
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,760
要是按之前说好的
I'd be a lot more comfortable

258
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,150
你亲自去说  我会放心许多
if it was you going directly, as we discussed.

259
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,160
这样就牵涉不到我  你也就更安全了
This puts distance on me, which puts distance on you.

260
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,610
你今晚亲自去见冯
I want you to meet with Feng tonight.

261
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,510
-不用中间人  -明白
- No proxies. - Understood.

262
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,720
古德温先生那边办得如何了
Now where are we with Mr. Goodwin?

263
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,150
随时可以下手  判个35年或者无期
Any day now. Thirty-five to life.

264
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,140
网络恐怖主义  判刑都很重
Cyber terrorism. Penalties are stiff.

265
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,170
务必做得干净利落  道格
This needs to be clean, Doug.

266
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,130
会的
It will be.

267
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,950
一击致命
One fall of the axe.

268
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,410
有消息告诉我
Keep me informed.

269
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,140
是  先生
Yes, sir.

270
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,560
我认为你的做法真是太勇敢了
Well, I just think what you did took so much bravery.

271
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,500
在直播节目上  当着全国观众的面
To go on air like that, in front of the whole country,

272
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,850
讲出你的经历
and say what you did?

273
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,690
这对我的确不容易
That means a lot to me.

274
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,320
我很钦佩两位的努力  为了帮助
And I admire what you both have been doing to advocate for the –

275
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,160
那些受害者
well, for the victims.

276
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,560
是女性  就像你和我  不只是受害者
Well, women, like you and me. Not victims.

277
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,830
还有男人  这无关性别
Men, too. It's not gender-specific.

278
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,690
是啊
Well, yes.

279
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,430
你愿意参与进来吗
Would you consider pitching in?

280
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,150
怎么参与
How?

281
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,360
如果有第一夫人支持  我们的表态就有力多了
It would send a strong message if we had the First Lady in our corner.

282
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,710
如果你觉得我能帮上忙的话
If you think I could help.

283
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,430
妇女党团的领袖
Well, if the head of the Women's Caucus,

284
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,350
以及白宫的第一和第二夫人加起来...
both wives from the White House...

285
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,300
这样的组合他们没法无视
That's a meeting they couldn't sweep under the rug.

286
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,880
主席肯派人来  就已经是很好的兆头了
And the fact that the Chairman sent anyone is promising,

287
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,750
但我们得保证他真能听到我们的声音
but we need to make sure our message gets back to him.

288
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,500
只是  我没有过此类经历
I just...I haven't been through the same sort of experience.

289
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,060
这有什么妨碍呢
Well, why should that prevent you?

290
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,460
我不知道我是不是有发言权
I don't know if I have a right to speak about it.

291
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,150
你可是第一夫人
You're the First Lady.

292
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,040
你有权发表任何言论
You have a right to speak about anything you want.

293
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,310
-怀特先生  -马博利太太
- Mr. White? - Mrs. Marbury.

294
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,580
叫我苏珊
I'm Susan.

295
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,710
很高兴见到你
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

296
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,870
我知道这里挺偏僻的
I know I'm a little off the beaten path.

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
找这里困难吗
Did you have any trouble finding me?

298
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,310
不  您给的指示很明确  找起来很轻松
No. The directions were great. Easy as pie.

299
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,400
那就好
Well, good.

300
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,210
请进
Come in.

301
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,470
我得承认  我都期待一整天了
I have to admit I've been looking forward to this all day.

302
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,190
没想到你们这么快就要宣布了
I didn't realize you were announcing so soon.

303
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,190
我们收到了慷慨的捐款
We've had some great luck with the endowment.

304
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,310
我丈夫生前没受到多少嘉奖
Well, my husband didn't get much recognition while he was alive.

305
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,640
计划生育协会想以他来命名基金
I was so thrilled when Planned Parenthood asked to

306
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,450
真让我激动
name a fund after him.

307
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,240
您肯同意  我们也很高兴
Well, we're thrilled that you're open to it.

308
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,050
你之前打电话说有些问题要问
When you called, you said you had some questions?

309
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,840
问题挺敏感的  所以我想亲自来问
They're delicate. That's why I wanted to come in person.

310
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,280
怎么个"敏感"法
"Delicate", how?

311
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,690
很多人会抗议向未成年人
There are a lot of people who will protest

312
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,920
提供这方面的经济资助
this sort of financial assistance to minors.

313
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,330
我们得保证他们找不到诽谤我们的根据
And we want to make sure they have no cause to smear us.

314
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,400
我丈夫这辈子  总有人想诋毁他
People tried to smear my husband his entire career.

315
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,980
他从不让这些事影响他的工作
He never let it affect the work he was doing.

316
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,990
您丈夫实施过任何非法堕胎手术吗
Did your husband ever perform any illegal abortions?

317
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,040
我需要您的答案  马博利太太
I need you to answer me, Mrs. Marbury.

318
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,610
您丈夫实施过任何非法堕胎手术吗
Did your husband perform any illegal abortions?

319
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,180
我不想讨论这个
I won't discuss that.

320
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,900
没有未上报的吗
Nothing unreported?

321
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,410
年轻人  你年纪不大  不会记得
Young man, you're not old enough to remember.

322
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,520
但在过去  人人...
But there was a time when everybody --

323
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,870
有没有涉及什么大人物
What about any prominent figures

324
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,230
能被反堕胎人士拿来当靶子的
who the Anti-Choice crowd could vilify?

325
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,690
没有
No.

326
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,760
马博利医生有没有为克莱尔·安德伍德做过堕胎
Did Dr. Marbury perform an abortion for Claire Underwood?

327
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,010
不  他没有
No, he did not.

328
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,800
我知道他做过
I know for a fact that he did.

329
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,090
这是谎话  我想请你马上离开
That is not true, and I would like you to leave now.

330
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,920
抱歉  马博利太太
Forgive me, Mrs. Marbury.

331
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,200
我对您没说实话
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

332
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,700
我叫赛斯·格雷森
My name's Seth Grayson.

333
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,220
我不为计划生育协会工作
I don't work for Planned Parenthood.

334
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,890
冯先生

335
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,320
国内常委们推测  搞秘密外交的是你

336
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,650
{\an8}华尔街电讯报

337
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,650
{\an8}美国在世贸组织撤诉

338
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,540
香港出现了两篇文章

339
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,940
都提到了你的名字

340
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,960
要我联系副总统吗

341
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,430
不  让他来找我
No. Let him come to me.

342
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,780
给塔斯克先生打电话
Get Mr. Tusk on the phone.

343
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,840
你真该为自己感到羞愧
You should ashamed of yourself.

344
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,560
我是为了你好  马博利太太
I'm doing this for your own good, Mrs. Marbury.

345
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,740
想想媒体炒作的后果
Imagine the media frenzy.

346
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,390
您丈夫生前的名声尽毁
Your husband's legacy, destroyed.

347
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,750
媒体日日夜夜追着您不放
The press hounding you, day and night.

348
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,660
计划生育基金  也没有了
And Planned Parenthood Fund, gone.

349
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,030
我怎么知道你是不是为她工作
How do I know you work for her?

350
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,750
而不是什么右翼狂热分子  打算摧毁...
That you're not just some right-wing fanatic who wants to destro?

351
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,170
否则我就不会亲自登门拜访了
Because I wouldn't have done you the courtesy of paying a visit.

352
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,950
来的就不是我
There would've been an army of

353
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,730
而是一队卫星转播车了
satellite trucks at your door instead of me.

354
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,610
我不会告诉任何人的  如果你是担心这个
Well, I won't tell anyone, if that's what you're worried about.

355
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,360
我相信您
I believe you.

356
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,930
您丈夫有没有对他帮助过的女人做过任何记录
Did your husband keep records of any kind of who he assisted?

357
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,110
任何东西  笔记或非公开记录
Anything at all? Notes? Unofficial records?

358
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,790
他有一本日记
He kept a journal.

359
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,260
您还能找到吗
Do you still have it?

360
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,950
我能看看吗
May I?

361
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,950
看吧
Go ahead.

362
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,500
我得把它带走
Oh. I need to take this with me.

363
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,290
你不能把那页撕掉吗
Can't you just take out that page?

364
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,410
如果有人找到这本日记  这几页又缺了
Someone finds this with pages missing,

365
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,820
那会引起怀疑
that could raise eyebrows.

366
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,810
这里面有他60年的人生
There's 60 years of his life in there.

367
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,630
从我们相遇到他去世
From when we met until he died.

368
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,490
那您希望那六十年被遗忘
And do you want six decades

369
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,490
却只剩下25年前8月的一个晚上吗
reduced to one night in August...25 years ago?

370
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,590
想象一下这里当时的情形
Now just imagine what it looked like back then.

371
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,490
山脊边缘是茂密的灌木丛
The edge of the ridge was a dense thicket,

372
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,610
北方军队得以长驱直入  在骡子鞋列队
which allowed the Northern troops to come in and form on the Mule Shoe.

373
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,510
南方军在山脊顶端
Now the Southern regiments were entrenched

374
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,490
这一带挖好了战壕
in this area at the apex of the line.

375
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,800
如您所见
As you can see,

376
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,950
这里的地形迫使双方向下走  逼近彼此
the topography really forced the two sides down towards each other.

377
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,000
这里就是血腥角
This is the Bloody Angle.

378
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,860
没错
That's right.

379
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,690
我昨晚还读到了相关内容
I was reading about it last night.

380
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,630
短兵相接  白刃相见
Close quarters, hand-to-hand combat.

381
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,640
据说  南北双方共有一万五千名士兵
All told, about 15,000 Union-Confederate soldiers

382
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,650
在血腥角这块半英里宽的战场上
lost their lives here at the Bloody Angle, on a battlefield

383
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,250
失去了生命
that's only about half a mile wide.

384
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
副总统先生  我们今天为您准备了一份惊喜
Now, Mr. Vice President, we have a surprise for you today.

385
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,070
向您介绍麦高文旅第12军团的
I'd like to introduce you to Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood

386
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,540
奥古斯都·以利亚·安德伍德下士
of the 12th Regiment of the McGowan Brigade,

387
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,640
您的曾曾曾祖父
your great-great-great-grandfather.

388
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,860
我在这场战役中牺牲于此
I died here in this battle.

389
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,010
我觉得是搞错了吧
I think there's been a mistake.

390
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,620
我祖父从没说过祖上有人参加过内战
My grandfather never mentioned any Underwoods in the war.

391
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,340
我们做过调查
We did our research.

392
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,910
他就是在这里战斗牺牲的
He definitely fought and died here.

393
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,210
我只有24岁  而我儿子
I was 24. And my son,

394
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,720
你的曾曾祖父只有两岁
your great-great-grandfather was two years old.

395
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,950
我从没见过他
I never met him.

396
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,620
就是在这里吗  在血腥角
It happened here, at the Bloody Angle?

397
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,740
在那片林子边上
At the edge of those woods.

398
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,340
我的脑袋被石头砸扁了
My skull was bashed in with a rock.

399
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,440
奥古斯都  谢谢你
Augustus, thank you.

400
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,960
这边  还有一些
Now, uh, over here we've got something that's,

401
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,310
有趣的东西
uh, very interesting as well.

402
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,780
等一下
Uh, j—just a moment.

403
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,610
接着说
Tell me more.

404
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,450
当时正是半夜
It was the middle of the night.

405
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,910
我们的子弹打光了  只剩下刺刀
And we were out of musket balls, just bayonets.

406
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,110
而且只有一半人有刺刀  我什么都没有
Only half of us had those. I had nothing.

407
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,330
只能靠这双手
Just these hands.

408
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,880
天很黑  什么都看不见
So dark, couldn't see nothing.

409
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,780
但能听北方佬在朝我们跑来
But you could hear 'em, the Yanks, runnin' toward us.

410
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,700
接着就能闻到他们了
And then you could smell 'em.

411
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,610
我遇到的第一个北方佬
First Yank that brushed up against me,

412
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,050
被我掐住了脖子  倒在地上
I grab him by the throat, fall down on the ground.

413
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,920
我用力打他  打到皮开肉绽
I bit him so hard, I could taste the bone.

414
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,760
然后他抓起一块石头  砸中了这里
Then he grabs a rock and brings it down right here.

415
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,040
我就这么死了
And that was that.

416
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,620
我被埋在万人冢里  没有墓碑
I was buried in a mass grave, no headstone.

417
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,980
能给您和奥古斯都拍张合影吗
Could we get a picture with you and Augustus?

418
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,530
好
Yes.

419
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,050
谢谢你
Thank you.

420
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,580
他相当认真啊
He takes it rather seriously.

421
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,450
是啊  他们都很认真
Oh, yeah. They all do.

422
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,950
前面有我们重建的
Now, up ahead, we have examples of,

423
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,680
邦联军壁垒的模型
uh, Confederate ramparts that we've reconstructed.

424
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,100
可以看到他们是如何伐木挖战壕的
And you can see how they cut the timber and made the trenches.

425
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,350
在战斗过程中
Now these trenches traded hands

426
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,200
这些战壕几次易手
many times over the course of the battle.

427
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,510
你有钥匙
You have keys.

428
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,870
你归我们管  没错  我们有钥匙
We own you. Yes, we have keys.

429
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,800
我去把衣服穿上
I'm gonna put some clothes on.

430
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,140
别想衣服的事了
Forget your clothes.

431
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,360
你的原话"你真想这么做吗"
And I quote, "You sure you wanna do this?"

432
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,300
"我没选择了  但你还有"
And I quote, "I don't have a choice, but you do."

433
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,640
你他妈以为自己在干什么
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

434
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,240
他应该知道他究竟要做什么
He should know what he's getting into.

435
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,010
这是丝绸睡裤吗
Are those silk pajamas?

436
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,450
近距离看更有档次了
Looks even fancier in person.

437
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,580
腰果
Cashew.

438
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,500
不  别碰她
No. Don't touch her.

439
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,210
过来  小家伙
Hey, there, little guy.

440
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,360
我以前在监控里见过你
I've seen you before on camera, hmm?

441
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,680
请把她放下
Please put her down.

442
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,850
不要冒险
Don't take the chance.

443
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,880
这这双鞋是在彭尼百货公司买的
I bought these shoes at J.C. Penney,

444
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,350
含税价72块
$72 with tax.

445
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,250
橡胶鞋底  用水就能冲干净
Rubber soles. You can clean 'em off with a hose.

446
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,220
求求你  你弄伤她了
Please, you're hurting her.

447
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
我也有一只宠物  他叫嘉文·奥尔西
I have a pet, too. His name is Gavin Orsay.

448
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,240
坐下
Sit.

449
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,760
我说"坐下"
I said, "Sit."

450
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,700
瞧瞧你多乖呀  嘉文
Look what a good boy you are, Gavin.

451
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,820
你想让我这么做吗
Is that what you need me to do?

452
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,120
安静  我说"去捡"  你就去
Quiet. When I say "fetch," you fetch.

453
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,010
现在我们去抓卢卡斯  就像我们说好的那样
And now we are going to fetch Lucas, just like we discussed.

454
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,790
你要是敢咬我  我就杀了你
If you try to bite my hand, I will put you to sleep.

455
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,120
介意我拿两瓶吗
Mind if I take a couple?

456
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,270
道格·斯坦普  我是副总统的幕僚长
Doug Stamper, I'm the Vice President's Chief of Staff.

457
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,980
我知道  坐吧
I know. Sit down.

458
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,430
我祖父参加过革命
My grandfather fought in the Revolution.

459
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,860
中国当时很穷
China was poor, then.

460
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,410
很难买到糖
Sugar was hard to come by.

461
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,380
现在中国到处能买到糖
Now sugar's everywhere in China.

462
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,160
要来杯古典鸡尾酒吗
Do you like Old-Fashioneds?

463
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,450
不  谢谢
No, thanks.

464
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,100
我看到新闻了
I've seen the news.

465
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,650
你们政府对我们撤诉非常高兴
Your government was enthusiastic about our dropping the suit.

466
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,270
他们还在国内将其鼓吹为一场胜利
They've touted it as a victory back home.

467
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,390
确实是胜利  但不是我们想要的胜利
It is a victory, but not the victory we wanted.

468
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,680
这让我们很难相信
We're finding that difficult to believe.

469
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,490
你说我们  是指副总统吧
By "we," you mean the Vice President.

470
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,180
我指的是美国政府
I mean the American government.

471
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,030
他声称自己就代表美国政府
Which he proclaims to represent.

472
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,170
没错  而我代表他
He does. And I'm representing him.

473
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,930
斯坦普先生  别吹嘘你的地位
Don't inflate your status, Mr. Stamper.

474
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,680
你不过是个跑腿的
You're nothing but an errand boy.

475
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,540
你要对副总统说什么吗
Do you have a message for the Vice President?

476
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,090
如果他代表美国政府
If he represents the American government,

477
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,870
那他为什么没能转达我的要求
then why did he fail to communicate my request?

478
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,260
我们质疑你的合法性  冯先生
We question your legitimacy, Mr. Feng.

479
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,200
你们代表团的做法和言论
Nothing your delegation has done or said has,

480
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,620
都与你的要求背道而驰
in any way, supported your requests.

481
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,060
闻闻
Smell that.

482
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,340
我用了高档珍稀的麦卡伦
I use Macallan Rare and Fine,

483
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,480
1926年产  一瓶四万美金
1926. $40,000 a bottle.

484
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,770
你以前酗酒  是吗
You used to be an alcoholic, correct?

485
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,470
酒瘾是戒不掉的  只能克制
Not "used to be." Still am. A sober one.

486
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,030
你怀念这味道吗
Do you miss it?

487
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,970
那可是五千美元
Five thousand dollars you just spilled.

488
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,210
我会寄张支票给你
I'll send you a check.

489
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,000
我喜欢你  斯坦普先生  即便你只是个跑腿的
I like you, Mr. Stamper, even if you're just an errand boy.

490
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,620
我再问你一次
I'll ask you again.

491
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,460
你要对副总统说什么吗
What is your message for the Vice President?

492
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,700
恢复起诉  否则杰斐逊港大桥项目将取消
There will be no Port Jefferson Bridge unless the lawsuit is reintroduced.

493
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,250
到时  常委会会有人抗议
When you do, there will be those on the Standing Committee who protest,

494
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,470
我会搞定他们
but I'll manage them.

495
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,760
大多数人想要改革
The majority want reform.

496
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,400
我会告诉副总统
I'll tell the Vice President.

497
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,910
斯坦普先生  还有一条
Mr. Stamper, one more message.

498
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,920
请提醒副总统  我们来这里
Please remind the Vice President that we are both here

499
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,460
是应我们共同的朋友塔斯克先生的邀请
at the behest of our mutual friend, Mr. Tusk.

500
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,160
如果副总统不愿意合作  我就直接跳过他
If the Vice President fails to cooperate, I will simply bypass him.

501
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,130
怎么了
Yes?

502
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,390
是道格
It's Doug.

503
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,530
好吧
Fine.

504
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,190
跟冯谈了
Spoke with Feng.

505
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,150
给你的洋葱圈
Here's your onion rings.

506
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,910
你知道朗斯特里特将军就是在这里
Did you know that General Longstreet was shot here,

507
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,270
被他自己人意外误伤害死的
accidentally, by his own men in the dark?

508
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,700
不  我不知道
No...I didn't.

509
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,290
好吧  跟我介绍一下进展吧
All right. Bring me up to date.

510
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,730
跟冯谈得怎么样了
Where are we with Feng?

511
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,990
他要我们恢复诉讼
He wants us to resume the lawsuit.

512
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,620
看来他要坚持立场
So, he's sticking to his guns.

513
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,190
我们不起诉  大桥项目就取消
If we don't reintroduce it, there's no bridge project.

514
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,660
那样总统会很失望
Well, that would greatly upset the President.

515
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,140
要我转达冯的意思吗
Do you want me to deliver Feng's message?

516
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,060
绝对不要
Absolutely not.

517
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,740
我们就要让总统生气
We want the President angry.

518
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,860
不过要想办法不让他怪罪在我身上
The tricky part is making sure he doesn't direct it toward me.

519
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,800
那你要我做什么
So what do you want me to do?

520
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,990
联系凯茜的人
Get a hold of Cathy's people.

521
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,030
决不能提及诉讼
Do not mention the lawsuit at all.

522
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,630
让他们自己提大桥项目
Have them bring up the bridge instead.

523
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,370
看看冯是不是在虚张声势
Let's see if Feng is bluffing.

524
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,350
是  先生
Yes, sir.

525
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,160
得吸取朗斯特里特的教训  他树大招风
We must learn from Longstreet. He rode too high in the saddle.

526
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,120
如果明天有人朝我开枪
If a bullet comes my way tomorrow,

527
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,330
那绝不会是意外  而且我得赶快躲开
it will not be an accident, and I must be quick to duck.

528
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,510
先生们  感谢你们的到来
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

529
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,520
副总统会出席吗
Is the Vice President attending?

530
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,490
不会  他不在华盛顿
No, he's not. He's out of town.

531
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,510
我只是决定用他的办公室
I just decided to use his office

532
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,060
因为他的比我的大得多
because it's a bit bigger than mine.

533
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,310
请坐吧
Please, sit.

534
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,570
我知道这不是你们第一次
I know this isn't the first conversation

535
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,120
谈性侵犯的问题
you've had about sexual assault.

536
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,470
我们和议员女士
We've had a very open dialogue

537
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,560
已经进行了一段时间的公开对话了
with the Congresswoman for quite some time.

538
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,540
可以说"公开"
"Open" is one way to put it.

539
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,140
我倒觉得参谋长联席会议只是在默默忍受我
I think the Joint Chiefs have tolerated my concerns, but

540
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,140
公平来讲  我们一直有做出积极回应
To be fair, we've been quite responsive.

541
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,010
过去两年里...
Over the past two years alone, we --

542
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,070
议员女士对我表达了她的沮丧
The Congresswoman has expressed her frustration to me

543
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,700
因为这件事上仍有改进空间
that there's still room for improvement.

544
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,040
安德伍德夫人  我能说几句吗
Mrs. Underwood, if I may.

545
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,840
请讲
Please.

546
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,560
这件事我们十分看重
This is an issue we've grappled with seriously.

547
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,930
我们增加了相关教育和防范措施
Increased education and prevention measures,

548
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,130
整改汇报流程
restructuring the reporting process,

549
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,710
杜绝军事法庭的滥用职权现象
insulating courts martial from abuse of power.

550
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,090
但还是不够
It's still not enough.

551
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,110
我们不会进行民事审判的
Civilian jurisdiction is not gonna happen.

552
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,290
我们都清楚这是议员女士所希望的
We're all aware that's what the Congresswoman would prefer,

553
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,290
但我们不会允许我们...
but we won't allow our cha--

554
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,930
我迟到了吗
Am I late?

555
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,390
是我的错  会面提前了
It's my fault. The meeting got pushed up.

556
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,280
我本想给你发邮件的  非常抱歉
I meant to email you. I'm very sorry.

557
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,370
没关系  请坐
That's fine. Please, sit.

558
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,640
我们不知道您也会来  沃克夫人
We didn't know you'd be attending, Mrs. Walker.

559
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,220
抱歉打断你们了
I'm sorry for interrupting.

560
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,680
请继续
Continue.

561
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,670
正如我刚刚所说
As I was saying,

562
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,400
将性侵案件的审判权完全交给民事法庭
putting sexual assault cases entirely in the hands of civilian courts

563
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,880
从根本上侵蚀了军队自我约束的能力
fundamentally erodes the military's ability to self-discipline.

564
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,450
那要是实施民事监管  而不是民事法庭呢
What about civilian oversight instead of civilian courts?

565
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,970
任何让步  都会一发不可收拾
That's a slippery slope.

566
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,250
对于种族融合  也曾有人说过类似的话
There were those who said the same about racial integration.

567
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,060
融合没有改变核心的运作本质...
Integration didn't change the core operational nature of the --

568
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,250
但的确证明了军方可以实现自我改革
But it did prove that the military could shape its own evolution.

569
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,540
那是没错  但就这个问题
Absolutely. But in this case,

570
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,940
民事监管不是解决办法
civilian oversight is not the answer.

571
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,080
我丈夫没有军衔  但他监管军方
My husband is a civilian who oversees the military.

572
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,150
你难道想说
Are you suggesting that

573
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,680
民众在这种问题上无从提供指导吗
civilians can offer no guidance in matters like this?

574
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,600
抱歉  沃克夫人  我完全不是那个意思
Forgive me, Mrs. Walker. I didn't mean to suggest that at all.

575
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,600
那或许你该听听你对面的民众是怎么想的
Then maybe you should listen to the civilian sitting across from you.

576
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,870
当然  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

577
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,370
这是你们出版的性侵防范读物
This is from your own sexual assault prevention literature.

578
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,730
上面写道  有些情况下
And in it, it says in some cases

579
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,970
更应该屈从  而不是抵抗
it may be advisable to submit than to resist.

580
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,230
所以我想  这方面显然还有可以改进的地方
I think it's quite clear that there's still room for improvement.

581
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,660
你知道冯山德吗
Did you know about Xander Feng?

582
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,090
在新闻上看到才知道的
Not 'til I saw his name on the wire.

583
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,090
{\an8}美联社  路透社等大新闻通讯社发布的新闻  媒体获得后会进行转载

584
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,940
他曾两次被指控腐败
He's been charged with corruption twice.

585
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,960
两次指控都撤销了
Both times the charges were dropped.

586
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,170
你知道在中国获罪后会怎样吗
Do you know what happens in China if you're convicted?

587
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,160
-我猜不会有好事  -判死刑
- I'm guessing it's not good. - You die.

588
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,230
我说对了
There you go.

589
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,230
这人如果再上"过场法庭"
We're talking about a man who's only one kangaroo court

590
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,230
{\an8}指完全是摆摆样子的法庭  根本不会认真按照法律进行审判

591
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,700
就必死无疑
away from lethal injection,

592
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,830
而且他富可敌国  腐败昭然若揭
who's filthy rich and clearly corrupt.

593
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,560
中方就派这样的人来吗
And this is who the Chinese send?

594
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,090
你问错人了
You're asking the wrong guy.

595
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,080
别再躲躲闪闪了
Stop dodging.

596
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,250
我不过是传了个话  仅此而已
I passed a note in class. That's all.

597
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,550
我们信任你  弗兰克
We placed our faith in you, Frank.

598
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,910
我们还有今明两天时间  总统先生
We still have the rest of the day and all of tomorrow, Mr. President.

599
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,660
我需要这座桥
I need this bridge.

600
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,240
否则我的基建项目就得叫停
Otherwise, we have to stall my infrastructure program.

601
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,660
没有外国投资  没法削减赤字
No foreign investment, no deficit reduction.

602
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,650
中方知道这一点
And the Chinese know this.

603
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,780
他们就是拿这个做筹码
They're using it for leverage.

604
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,770
但是为了什么呢
Yeah, but for what?

605
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,200
我也不清楚
Well, that I'm not sure of.

606
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,130
那我们派你去斯波特瑟尔韦尼亚干什么  弗兰克
Then why did we send you to Spotsylvania, Frank?

607
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,090
这些问题你该心里有数的
You're supposed to have answers to these questions.

608
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,300
总统先生  我一小时前和冯先生联系过
Mr. President, I spoke to Mr. Feng an hour ago.

609
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,850
他怎么说
What'd he say?

610
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,710
子弹来了
Here comes the bullet.

611
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,680
他说弗兰克没表达清楚他的意思
He claims that Frank hasn't been delivering his messages properly.

612
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,430
我已经逐字复述了他的要求
I have conveyed his requests word for word.

613
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,390
他说  你一直在唱反调
He says you've been doing the opposite.

614
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,710
究竟是谁在负责私下沟通  我还是雷蒙德
Whose responsible for the back-channeling here, me or Raymond?

615
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,850
你  弗兰克
You are, Frank.

616
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,340
我只是来帮忙的  不是来谈判的
I'm simply here to facilitate, not negotiate.

617
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,440
可你还继续私下联系
And yet you continue to have private conversations with

618
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,320
北京所谓的密使
Beijing's supposed emissary.

619
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
听着  弗兰克
Listen, Frank --

620
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,170
你要信任冯先生  而不是我吗  雷蒙德
Are you prepared to trust Mr. Feng's word over mine, Raymond?

621
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,700
没人质疑你的话  弗兰克
No one is doubting your word, Frank.

622
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,260
如果冯真的是为了他政府的利益
Well, if Feng is truly representing his government's interest,

623
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,870
为什么他在我这儿一套  雷蒙德那儿一套
then why is he telling Raymond one thing and telling me another?

624
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,930
那大桥项目取消是怎么回事
How do you explain the bridge falling through?

625
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,980
自由浮动汇率能让他受益
Well, he personally profits from a free-floating currency,

626
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,300
和他合作的人都是如此
just as anyone would who's in business with him,

627
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,760
就比如你  雷蒙德
such as yourself, Raymond.

628
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,640
精炼厂和大桥是两码事
The refinery and the bridge are two completely different issues.

629
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,900
我们先说桥的事
Let's keep our focus, here.

630
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,910
必须重谈建桥的事  没得商量
I want the bridge back on the table, end of story.

631
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,400
-凯瑟琳  -我明早第一个提这件事
- Catherine? - It'll be the first item I bring up in the morning.

632
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,650
弗兰克  先按兵不动  别联系冯
Frank, stay put for now. But don't contact Feng.

633
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,130
你也是  雷蒙德
And that goes for you, too, Raymond.

634
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,010
建桥的事谈妥之前不许你们再私下会面
I don't want any more back-channeling until the bridge is revived.

635
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,250
凯瑟琳  有什么事直接和我说
And, Catherine, you communicate directly with me.

636
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,260
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

637
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,310
那就先说到这里了
All right. We're done here.

638
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,940
第一滴血溅了出来
The first drops of blood have been spilt.

639
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,260
子弹擦过我的脸颊  但我没有倒下
Bullet grazed my cheek, but I haven't fallen.

640
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,070
道格  想个办法让我见到冯
Doug, find me a way to meet Feng.

641
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,310
有件事我们得先谈谈
We need to discuss something first.

642
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,160
怎么了
What's wrong?

643
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,590
我刚跟一个叫赛斯·格雷森的人通了电话
I just got off the phone with a guy named Seth Grayson.

644
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,420
我和我丈夫聊过了
I've spoken with my husband.

645
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,500
道格说了  感谢你能见我
Doug told me. Thank you for fitting me in today.

646
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,750
-是这个吧  -86年8月
- Is that it? - August '86.

647
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,590
我们凭什么相信你
And why should we trust you?

648
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,120
有些证据康纳没能抹去
There was evidence that Connor didn't make disappear.

649
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,120
我本可以把这个拿给《美国周刊》
I could've taken this to Us Weekly

650
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,390
报酬够我买新房了
and bought a new house.

651
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,230
可我把它带来给您
Instead, I brought it to you.

652
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,890
我当时面试的时候你为什么没申请
And why didn't you apply when I was interviewing candidates?

653
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,850
申请了也没用  薇拉不喜欢我
There's no point. Willa doesn't like me.

654
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,250
她怕我
I intimidate her.

655
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,650
这日记就是我的简历
That journal is my version of a resume.

656
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,510
或是勒索信
Or extortion.

657
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,250
我没想勒索您  安德伍德夫人
I'm not extorting you, Mrs. Underwood.

658
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,140
我只是想强调
I'm just highlighting the difference

659
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,540
好的决定和正确决定的差别
between a good choice and the right choice.

660
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,090
那你说解雇刚聘用三个月的媒体主管
And tell me, how would we handle the repercussions

661
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,280
所带来的影响我们要怎么应对
of firing our comm director three months after we hire him.

662
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,160
您不用解雇他
You don't fire him.

663
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,560
您告诉他雇用我是为了减轻工作量
You tell him that you're bringing me on board to help with the workload.

664
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,610
他还负责您  我负责您丈夫
He stays on with you. I cover your husband.

665
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,470
康纳不会喜欢和我合作的
Connor will hate working with me.

666
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,700
过几个月我再找人来挖他墙角
I'll arrange a job offer elsewhere in a few months.

667
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,440
到那时  他会愿意接受的
By the time it comes in, he'll want to move on.

668
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,410
康纳也知道  如何保证他不会公开
Connor knows. What's to prevent him from going public?

669
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,680
我能搞定康纳·埃利斯
I can handle Connor Ellis.

670
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,990
您只能相信我  我...
You just have to take me on my word on that. I –

671
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,310
我只知道
Here's what I know.

672
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,030
您要弄垮我比我扳倒您容易得多
It is far easier for you to destroy me than the other way around.

673
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,100
我得和我丈夫谈谈
I have to speak to my husband.

674
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,810
没问题
Of course.

675
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,560
我没有复印
I didn't make any copies.

676
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,690
您手上的是唯一的一份
You have the only one.

677
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,340
纯尊尼获加黑牌
Uh, Johnny Walker Black, neat.

678
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,240
-东西在哪  -我口袋里
- Where is it? - It's in my pocket.

679
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,560
给我吧
Come on.

680
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,060
-有问题吗  -没有  一切就绪
- Something up? - No. We're good to go.

681
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,110
你看起来很紧张
You seem nervous.

682
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,580
虽然我干了二十年违法乱纪的事
Just because I've been breaking the law for 20 years

683
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,030
我还是会觉得紧张
doesn't mean I don't still get nervous.

684
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,370
-嘉文  -别说我的名字
- Gavin. - Do not say my name.

685
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,130
看着我
Look at me.

686
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,400
没问题的  我们练习过了
It's gonna be fine. We practiced.

687
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,950
我有信心  会成功的
I'm confident. This is gonna work.

688
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,880
我请你
I got your drink.

689
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,300
他非常有资历
He's more than qualified.

690
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,440
你的直觉怎么说
What do your instincts tell you?

691
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,210
我不想再增加曝光度了
That I just don't wanna end up more exposed.

692
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,500
格雷森都知道了
Well, Grayson already knows.

693
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,190
我们要是不表现出...
I mean, if we don't exhibit some degree of --

694
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,770
让道格去查查他
Have Doug look into him.

695
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,700
看看我们有没有筹码
Let's see if there's some leverage.

696
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,000
但是我们不知道他能查到什么
Yeah, but we don't know what he'll find

697
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,280
什么时候能查到  这期间格雷森又会做什么
or when,  or what he'll do in the meantime.

698
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,430
这让我们无从防备
And that puts us into unchartered territory.

699
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,010
如果我们解雇康纳  他也会告密的
Well, Connor will expose us, too, if we let him go.

700
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,720
处理得好就不会
Not if it goes smoothly.

701
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,450
如果现在拒绝格雷森  我们无法预料后果
If we turn away Grayson now, we can't predict anything.

702
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,840
而且他可比我们要输得起
And, look, he has a lot less to lose than we do.

703
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:00,270
好吧  我只是不相信他  弗兰西斯
Okay. I just – I don't think we can trust him, Francis.

704
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,090
如果康纳尽了职我们也不会有这麻烦了
We wouldn't be having this conversation if Connor had done his job.

705
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,770
我宁可要个不可信任的手下
And I'd rather manage someone I don't trust

706
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:05,760
也不要做事不周到的
than someone who is reckless.

707
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,360
好吧  下一步怎么做
Fine. What's the next step?

708
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,390
我先亲自跟格雷森谈谈
I'd like to talk to Grayson myself first,

709
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,790
然后我让道格跟康纳谈谈
and then I'll have Doug talk to Connor.

710
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,720
你那边怎么样
How are you doing?

711
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,820
你关注新闻了吗
You been following the news?

712
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,520
对我们来说是好是坏
Is it bad for us? Or good?

713
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,750
都有可能
Could go either way.

714
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,450
需要我的话就开口
I'm here if you need me.

715
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,600
我明天就回去
I'm back tomorrow.

716
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,290
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. - Love you, too.

717
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,300
-都准备好了吗  -都准备好了  先生
- We all set? - All set, sir.

718
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,450
走吧
Let's go.

719
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,720
不  把灯关掉
Oh, no, no. Turn those off.

720
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,740
把灯关掉
Turn those off.

721
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,600
他在哪
Where is he?

722
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,810
这边走  先生
Right this way, sir.

723
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,260
奥古斯都会拉小提琴吗
Did Augustus play?

724
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,820
我希望我会
I like to think I did.

725
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,860
你自己的名字是什么
What's your own name?

726
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,730
我在这里的时候  我就是奥古斯都·安德伍德
When I'm here, I'm Augustus Underwood.

727
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,040
你的真名是什么
What's your real name?

728
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,750
你觉得这不真实吗
Doesn't this feel real to you?

729
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,610
你能带我去看他死的地方吗  具体地点
Will you show me where he died? The exact spot.

730
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,110
好的  先生
I will, sir.

731
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,330
我要去向我的祖先致敬
I'm gonna pay respects to my ancestor.

732
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,430
请给我点隐私
I would appreciate a little privacy.

733
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,280
我们在这里等着
We'll wait here.

734
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,110
小约翰在移动
Little John on the move.

735
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,090
就在那些树后
Just beyond those trees.

736
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,600
谢谢你  我自己过去吧
Thank you. I'll be good from here.

737
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,760
没事
We're fine.

738
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,330
希望你没等太久
I hope you haven't waited long.

739
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,970
这里很平静  我不介意
It's peaceful here. I didn't mind.

740
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,870
现在很平静  但有一万五千人曾在这里丧生
Peaceful now. Fifteen thousand men died in these woods.

741
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,010
我的曾曾曾祖父死在我们站的地方
My grandfather's grandfather died where we're standing.

742
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,370
我的祖父在革命中牺牲
My grandfather was killed in the Revolution.

743
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,450
我听说了
So I've heard.

744
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,410
你怕死吗  副总统先生
Do you fear death, Mr. Vice President?

745
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,350
跟其他人一样
No more or less than any man.

746
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,670
死亡给我激励  让我去经历一切
It motivates me. To experience everything,

747
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,880
在一切化为粪土之前  努力成就伟业
accomplish all I can before it all vanishes.

748
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,350
在这方面我觉得我们很像
I think you and I are similar in that regard.

749
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,850
那我们为什么要彼此背道而驰呢
Then why are we working at cross purposes?

750
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,350
你的意思是
Now what you mean is,

751
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,680
为什么我不服从你和塔斯克先生
"Why am I not submitting to you and Mr. Tusk?"

752
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,710
你在破坏谈判
You're sabotaging the negotiations.

753
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:33,730
而你在利用谈判达到自己的目的
And you're using them for your own personal ends.

754
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,110
错了  我花了七年时间说服常委
Wrong. It's taken me seven years to convince the Standing Committee

755
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,680
这才是应该采取的做法
that this was the right course of action.

756
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:42,420
可以给你和塔斯克带来数十亿收益的做法
A course of action that will earn you and Tusk billions.

757
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,880
你约我在这里见面就为了攻击我吗
Why did you want this meeting? Just to attack me?

758
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,390
为了给雷蒙德带个信
To send a message to Raymond.

759
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,820
美国总统和我不是他的傀儡
The President of the United States and I are not his puppets.

760
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,380
你就这么跟他说
Now you tell him that.

761
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,950
好  桥的事没戏了  没有挽回余地
Fine. The bridge deal is dead. There will be no saving it.

762
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,020
随你怎么折腾吧
Stick a knife through its heart and put an apple in its mouth.

763
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,470
我才不在乎呢
I won't shed a tear.

764
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,770
你们总统会把失败归咎于你
Your President will ascribe the failure to you.

765
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,030
我愿意冒这个险
I'll take the risk.

766
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,760
好好想想  副总统先生
Think strategically, Mr. Vice President.

767
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,230
你这是把我们往绝路上推
You're setting us on a very dangerous course.

768
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,370
你知道格兰特将军是如何击败李将军的吗
Do you know how Grant defeated Lee?

769
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,680
他的人更多  仅此而已
He had more men. That's all.

770
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,050
而且他愿意让他们去送死
And he was willing to let them die.

771
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,770
是屠杀  而非策略  赢得了战争
It was butchery, not strategy, which won the war.

772
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,870
塔斯克先生和我有丰厚资源可以利用
Mr. Tusk and I have great resources at our disposal.

773
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,160
把你们的钱加起来
Add up all your billions together,

774
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,640
相当于斯洛伐克的国内生产总值
and you get the GDP of Slovakia.

775
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,860
我背后是美利坚合众国的联邦政府
I have the federal government of the United States of America.

776
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,190
你们的钱吓不倒我
Your money doesn't intimidate me.

777
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,050
你最多能买到影响力
The most that you can buy is influence.

778
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,210
但我可以利用宪法施压
But I wield Constitutional authority.

779
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,720
最强大的军队并不总是能取胜
The strongest army doesn't always win.

780
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,910
毛主席从几千人的军队起步
Mao started out with only a few thousand men.

781
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,600
最终打下了半个亚洲
They took over half a continent.

782
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:57,610
毛主席已经死了  他的中国也死了
Mao is dead. And so is his China.

783
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,740
但我没死
But I'm not.

784
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,400
目前还没有
Not yet.

785
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,560
别忘了  你的祖先为战败的一方而战
Don't forget. Your ancestor fought for the losing side.

786
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,780
成者王  败者寇
There is no sacred ground for the conquered.

787
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,060
我们这里有九千余台服务器  分属几百家客户
We have over 9,000 servers here, utilized by several hundred clients.

788
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,010
从小企业到大公司都有
Everything from small businesses to major corporations.

789
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,400
最大的客户都有谁
What are some of the largest clients?

790
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,860
这里最大的是美国电话电报公司
The largest here is AT&T.

791
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,160
他们的服务器占了这层大半的空间
Their servers occupy more than half of the floor space.

792
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,900
能让我看看吗
And can you show me?

793
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,600
当然
I am.

794
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,660
这边走
Right this way.

795
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,790
你昨晚有没有去见冯
Did you or did you not meet with Feng last night?

796
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,440
这话从何说起  雷蒙德
Where is this coming from, Raymond?

797
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,260
回答我  弗兰克
Answer the question, Frank.

798
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,500
上次谈话后我就没联系过他了  总统先生  
I have not contacted him since you and I spoke, Mr. President.

799
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,170
完全按照您的要求
Just as you instructed me to do.

800
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,450
冯可不是这么说的
Not according to Feng.

801
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,330
你不是也不许见他吗  雷蒙德
I believe you were also instructed to avoid him too, Raymond.

802
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,280
他自己找上门来的  我只是接了电话
He reached out to me. I just answered the call.

803
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,330
我们事先有明确的协议  弗兰克
We had clear, prearranged terms, frank.

804
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,920
私下接触了数月
Months of back-channeling.

805
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,680
我在第一线  总统先生
I am on the front lines, Mr. President.

806
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,170
我的亲身体会是
And I can tell you firsthand

807
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,560
我们现在面对的这个国家
that we are dealing with a regime

808
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,330
不仅有事隐瞒
that is not being forthright and

809
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,530
而且会利用任何风吹草动
will seize upon the faintest whiff of trepidation.

810
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,620
这是次考验
This is a test.

811
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,400
看我们被逼到什么境地会投降
To see how far they can push us before we break.

812
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,910
别让他们得逞  中止谈判
Do not play their game. End the talks.

813
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,500
我们不能反应过度
We can't overreact here.

814
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,940
他们中止了商贸联委会的谈判
Well, they walked away from the Joint Commission.

815
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,260
我们也可以中止峰会
We can walk away from the Summit.

816
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,070
经济损失难以估量  市场会
The economic fallout would be catastrophic. The market would--

817
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,650
要么向这个新兴超级大国卑躬屈膝也行
Or we can just kowtow and submit to the new reigning superpower.

818
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,340
别夸大其词  弗兰克
Don't be hyperbolic, Frank.

819
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,000
我们可是在跟全球四分之一的人口打交道
Well, we are dealing with one quarter of the world's population.

820
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,420
总统先生  这会酿成大错的
Mr. President, you would be making a disastrous mistake.

821
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,110
你到底效忠谁  雷蒙德
Where are your allegiances, Raymond?

822
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,780
是冯山德还是美国
With Xander Feng or to the United --?

823
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,720
你怎么敢质疑我的
Don't you dare question me about --

824
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,090
行了  安静
All right. Silence.

825
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,940
我犯了两个错误
There were two mistakes. Both of them mine.

826
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,200
第一个错误是允许你  雷蒙德  
The first was allowing you, Raymond,

827
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,260
让你的商业伙伴参与谈判
to enlist your business partner for these talks.

828
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,120
我只是想
I was simply trying to --

829
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,870
而第二个错误就是让你去  弗兰克
And the second was enlisting you, Frank.

830
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,190
不但没把话说清楚
Instead of clarity,

831
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,270
还造成误解  外交表现糟糕
we got miscommunication. That's poor diplomacy.

832
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,570
总统先生  听我说
Mr. President, listen --

833
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,570
不  你们的话我都听过了
Oh, no. I've listened. To both of you.

834
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,210
但只听到了互相谴责
And all I've heard is accusations.

835
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,160
如果你们谁都不愿负责  那我来
Now if neither of you will take responsibility, I will.

836
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,990
我们撤出
We're pulling out.

837
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,120
并非是听从你的意见  弗兰克
That's not because you suggested it, Frank.

838
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:36,310
而是因为你协商失败
It's because you've made such a mess of these negotiations

839
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,810
让我不得不表现出强硬态度
that I have no other choice than a show of strength.

840
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,130
你们两个都让我很失望
You've both disappointed me greatly.

841
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,830
总统先生
Mr. President --

842
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,610
总统已离线
The President has left the call.

843
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,010
雷蒙德  你还在吗
Raymond, are you still there?

844
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,710
这是他二十年来第一次
That's the first time he's ever hung up on me

845
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,330
挂我电话
in 20 years.

846
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,610
为你难过
Oh. I feel for you.

847
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,250
再见  弗兰克
Goodbye, Frank.

848
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,270
现在  杀戮开始
And the butchery begins.

849
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,170
从这排起  到后面七排全是
It's all the way down this row and the next seven rows over.

850
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,580
你想进去看看  是吧
Now you wanted to see inside one, right?

851
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,250
是  那就太好了
Yeah, that would be great.

852
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,570
进去吧
Go ahead.

853
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,730
其实没什么好看的
There's not much to it, actually.

854
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,550
就是一堆硬盘和电线
Just a lot of hard drives and wires.

855
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,220
说到文件备份  如果突然停电
So in terms of back-up, if the power goes down,

856
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,640
比如碰上自然灾害  
some natural disaster hits,

857
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,290
龙卷风或地震之类的  要怎么
like a storm, or an earthquake, what exactly --?

858
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,380
-趴在地上  -不许动
- On the ground. - Freeze!

859
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,180
-不  我  -立刻趴下
- No, no, I  - right now.

860
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,070
-趴下  立刻趴下  -我说了趴下
- On the ground! On the ground now! - I said on the fucking ground.

861
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,700
跟我同车回特区吧
Why don't you ride back to D.C. with me?

862
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,030
我们有事要谈
We need to discuss something.

863
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:52,780
怎么了
What's up?

864
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,990
我们车里谈
We'll talk about it in the car.

865
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,910
今天  我们在陆路战役游客中心破土动工
Today, we break earth on the Overland Campaign Visitors Center.

866
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,000
这样我们的后代
So that generations to come

867
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,340
能深刻体会这片圣地的重要意义
will fully absorb the importance of this hallowed ground,

868
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,620
铭记这片战役打响的荒野
the wilderness where the campaign commenced.

869
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,520
奥古斯都  请你来好吗
Augustus. Would you do the honor?

870
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,140
请为逝者默哀祈祷
And now a moment of silence and prayer for the dead.

871
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,340
谢谢各位
Thank you.

872
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,840
天佑美国
And God bless the United States of America.

873
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,150
刚收到消息  
I just heard.

874
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,480
我们抓到卢卡斯·古德温了
We got Lucas Goodwin.

876
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:58,570
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}"人民币被刻意低估"是长期困扰中美经贸关系的一个焦点议题
多年来  美国国会一直指责中国政府刻意压低人民币币值
使中国产品价格低廉  出口后占据价格优势
许多议员将美国的对华的巨大贸易逆差  美国国内制造业的萧条
均归咎于人民币币值的被低估
在这个问题上立场最强硬的是国会中的民主党议员
他们背后大多有美国工会的支持
很多议员家乡有大量从事制造业的选民
过去这些年  美国国会通过听证会和立法等多种形式
向中国政府施压  该问题也是中美经济事务会谈争论的焦点

878
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:28,570
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}但白宫在汇率问题上的立场要软得多
小布什政府一直顶住国会的压力  拒绝将中国政府列为"汇率操纵国"
奥巴马虽然在竞选时接受了工会的巨额捐款
但上任后也没有在这个问题上满足国会的强硬要求
白宫非常清楚地认识到  如果在这一问题上同中国硬碰硬
导致贸易战  其结果将是两败俱伤
所以本届美国政府一直拒绝公开将中国列为"汇率操纵国"
