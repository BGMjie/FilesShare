78
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,020

83
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,310
-至少能造出点声势  -那不够
- We can make a dent. - Dents don't cut it.

不管款筹得多快
Well, no matter how fast we ramp up fundraising,

85
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,110
都补不上缺口
we can't close the gap.

86
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,490
得切断他们的资金来源
We have to stop their money flow.

87
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,430
怎么切
I want to know how.

88
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,480
找到源头  釜底抽薪
Locate the source and then cut off the tap.

89
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,900
凭空出现这么多钱
With this sorta influx you can be sure that

90
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,260
肯定有人违规了
somebody's not playing by the rules,

91
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,190
但找不到源头就没法告状
but we can't whistle-blow until we find the source.

92
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,860
那就去找  而且要赶快
Then find it. And you sure as hell better find it soon.

You were supposed to steer Congress on my behalf.

100
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,680
我心情无比焦虑
No one is as concerned as me.

101
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,080
真应该把你留在国会
I shoulda kept you in the house,

102
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,260
向雷蒙德最初说的那样
like Raymond suggested from day one.

103
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,460
可你分心去掺和参议院  国情咨文
But you've been distracted by the Senate, State of the Union,

104
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,600
还干预外交
meddling with foreign diplomacy.

105
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,050
-是您要我去谈判的  -我知道我做了什么
- You asked me to negotiate-- - I know what I've done.

106
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,330
我也知道后果
And I know where it's gotten us.

107
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,700
先生  攻击我们的广告不是因为
Sir, the attack ads are not a result of anything--

108
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,630
你慌慌忙忙地到处扑火  而不是防止失火
You're scrambling from fire to fire instead of preventing them.

109
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,620
我不是联邦选举委员会  不能变魔...
I'm not the FEC, I can't wave a wand--

110
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,720
别就知道找借口  弗兰克  你不止这点本事
Give me more than excuses, Frank! You're better than that!

111
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,950
没准就是这点
Or maybe you're not.

112
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,350
您要是想找个沙袋撒气
If you need a punching bag,

113
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,580
那我就站在这儿让您出气
I will stand here and take the punches,

114
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,080
自我上任以来  我一次次做您的沙袋
as I have done time and time again, since I swore my oath.

115
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,930
可我更想照您的吩咐  回去工作
But I would much rather get back to work, as you've asked me to do.

116
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,140
你太过分了  弗兰克
You are out of line, Frank.

117
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,860
不出拳就放我走吧  总统先生
Dismiss me or keep swinging, Mr. President.

118
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,960
你走吧
You're dismissed.

119
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,840
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

120
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,580
丹·拉尼根转投那边了
Dan Lanagin switched teams.

121
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,170
这没道理啊
That doesn't make any sense.

122
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,430
共和党的大捐助人都没什么异常
I couldn't find any anomalies among big Republican donors,

123
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,860
于是我查了民主党的
so I checked our own.

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,360
拉尼根这季一分都没捐
Lanagin hasn't given a dime this quarter.

125
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,150
但没捐和资助共和党可不一样
Yeah, but not giving isn't the same as giving to the Republicans.

126
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,910
他赌场的账目  安永事务所做的
His casino's accounts. Ernst and Young.

127
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,400
捐了一千八百万  还不是给我们
Eighteen million for donations, and they're not going to us.

128
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,250
你怎么弄到的
How did you get your hands on those?

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,490
我有朋友  所以你才找我帮忙
I've got friends. That's why you solicit my services.

130
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,480
那广告花了大约两千五百万
The estimate for the ad buys was 25 million.

131
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,310
账目只到6月30日
Those accounts are up to date as of June 30th.

132
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,790
那之后应该还捐款了
They could have made more donations since then.

133
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,670
塔斯克
Tusk.

134
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,810
拉尼根的赌场在密苏里
Lanagin's casino is in Missouri.

135
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,080
雷蒙德·塔斯克吗
Raymond Tusk?

136
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,220
他对我和总统有不满
He's got an axe to grind with me and with the president.

137
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,980
选举委员会的文件里从未出现过他的名字
I've never seen his name on any FEC filings.

138
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,760
他从不捐助政党
He doesn't make political contributions.

139
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,990
所以才能进退自如
That's how he remains flexible.

140
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,800
你觉得他在想办法筹集资金吗
You think he's funneling the money somehow?

141
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,590
我不知道
I don't know.

142
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,610
你去堪萨斯城  去那家赌场
Get yourself to Kansas City. I want you in that casino.

143
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,340
-是  先生  -我会继续查的
- Yes, sir. - I'll keep digging.

144
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,270
接我太太的电话
Get me my wife.

145
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,150
-你从哪得到的菜谱  -我父亲教我的
- Where'd you get the recipe? - My father taught me.

146
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,800
-你跟你爸爸很亲密吗  -不
- You and your dad were close? - Nah.

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,750
烹饪肋排是那混蛋唯一能做好的事
Cooking ribs was the only thing that motherfucker did right.

148
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,430
-这话不能上报纸吧  -我有办法
- I guess you can't print that. - I have ways.

149
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,460
真的会上报纸吗
This really gonna be in the paper?

150
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,160
至少能上波士顿的报纸
At least in Boston, yeah.

151
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,610
我怎么觉得没人会在意
Don't see why anybody would care.

152
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,260
这是关于个人喜好
Well, it's a personal interest story.

153
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,700
那么多餐厅  美国副总统却偏偏喜欢这里
The vice president of the United States comes here, of all places.

154
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,490
-你是说这破地方吗  -我可没这么说
- You mean this shithole? - That's not what I said.

155
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,130
没关系
It's OK.

156
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,070
又不是泰姬陵
It's not the Taj Mahal.

157
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,630
他从什么时候开始来这里的
How long has he been coming?

158
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,130
大概有20年了吧
About 20 years now.

159
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,980
-他是个好人  弗兰克  -你还叫他弗兰克吗
- He's a good man, Frank. - You still call him Frank?

160
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,720
在这里  我才是总统
Hey, in this joint, I'm the president,

161
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,640
是副总统  也是国会
the vice president and the Congress.

162
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,930
他只是一名顾客  忠实的顾客
He just another customer. A loyal one.

163
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,820
所以他才喜欢这里吗
You think that's why he likes it here?

164
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,950
因为你像对待普通人那样对待他
'Cause you treat him like a regular person?

165
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,540
也许吧  不过主要还是因为这肋排
Maybe. Mostly it's the fuckin' ribs, though.

166
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,610
如果失业率上升至20%以上
Now, if unemployment goes up more than two-tenths,

167
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,090
我希望美联储考虑...
I want the Fed to consider...

168
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,630
来点什么吗  亲爱的
Get you something, hon.

169
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,970
请给我青柠苏打水
Club soda with lime, please?

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,680
-就这样吗  -对
- That's it? - Yeah.

171
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,740
-不要吃的吗  -不用  就这样
- Nothing to eat? - No. That's it.

172
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,000
你要是在戒酒  在这地方待着可挺难熬的
Tough spot to hang out if you're in the program.

173
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,270
-你怎么知道  -酒鬼眼里分外明
- How'd you know? - Takes one to know one, right?

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,270
-你多久了  -刚过一年  你呢
- How long? - Little over a year. You?

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,600
就要15年了
Going on 15.

176
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,690
赛马赢钱了吗
Any luck with the ponies?

177
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,810
没有  还没
None. Not yet.

178
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,000
选个数字  1到12
Pick a number. One through twelve.

179
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,530
Nine.

180
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,520
名声大噪
Hot Fuss.

181
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,590
听起来不错
Sounds about right.

182
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,390
苏打水马上来  亲爱的  配青柠
Club soda coming up, darling. With lime.

183
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,610
过去两小时他都没有动
Hasn't moved the last two hours.

184
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,980
也没跟任何人说话吗
And he hasn't spoken to anybody?

185
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,080
一直在赌
Just been betting on the races.

186
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,770
要我们带他进来吗
You want us to bring him in?

187
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,920
不  那是副总统的幕僚长
No. That's the vice president's chief of staff.

188
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,280
真的吗
Really?

189
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,010
别引发混乱  盯住他就行
We don't want to make a scene. Just keep an eye on him.

190
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,920
告诉我他干了什么  去了哪里  跟谁说过话
Let me know what he does, where he goes, and who he talks to.

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,030
明白  拉尼根先生
You got it, Mr. Lanagin.

192
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,860
你真该看看他们的表情
You should've seen their faces.

193
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,230
他们彻底糊涂了
They didn't know what to think.

194
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,010
特别是我让他们扶住沙袋时
Especially when I made 'em hold the bag.

195
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,000
您试过了吗
You tried it out?

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,260
那是当然
I sure as hell did.

197
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,340
很抱歉我那么冲你发脾气  弗兰克
I'm sorry I lashed out at you, Frank.

198
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,980
不  是我失礼了  有失妥当
No. I was disrespectful, and that was uncalled for.

199
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,270
我的情绪最近总有些失控
My temper's gotten away from me these days.

200
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,280
我有时需要被人吼一吼  清醒过来
I need to be jolted back into reality sometimes.

201
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,960
你是出于好意
It was a -- a kind gesture.

202
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,930
就是消遣罢了
Oh, just some good old fun.

203
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,980
特莉莎说我们这周要一起吃晚饭
Tricia tells me we're having dinner later this week.

204
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,660
是的  克莱尔也这样跟我说
Yes. Claire tells me the same.

205
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,240
能离开这里几小时也不错
Well, it'll be good to get out of this place for a few hours.

206
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,400
这幅画从肯尼迪时期就挂在这里了
It's been here since Kennedy.

207
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,870
是他出生那年画的
It was painted the same year he was born.

208
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,400
描绘的好像是一战的庆祝游行
It depicts, I think, a World War I parade.

209
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,050
每一幅画我都该了解一下
Oh, I should know every painting.

210
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,800
您似乎懂不少呢  至少了解这幅
Well, you seem to know quite a lot, at least about this one.

211
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,050
我想趁现在有机会  好好研究一下
Oh, I try to soak it all in while I can.

212
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,690
所有的历史
All the history.

213
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,970
痴迷于历史的总统
Presidents who obsess over history

214
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,010
痴迷于他们在历史中的地位
obsess about their place in it,

215
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,630
而不是如何创造历史
instead of forging it.

216
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,790
谁说的
Who said that?

217
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,490
我  就在刚才
I did. Just now.

218
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,390
白宫  一整天都熙熙攘攘
Ah, the White House. All day long it's buzzing,

219
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,770
这个时候却又如此冷清
and at this hour it's so desolate.

220
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,470
做总统是件伟大而珍贵的事情
The presidency is a great and precious thing.

221
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,080
而代价就是孤独
Loneliness is the price.

222
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,610
做个假设
Let's assume

223
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,460
如果杜鲁门总统就是坐在这其中一张椅子上
in one of these chairs, staring at this wall,

224
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,730
盯着墙  决定投放核弹
is where Truman decided to drop the bomb.

225
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,100
看看我们会不会有什么感觉
And see if we feel anything.

226
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,710
没感觉  你呢
Nothing. You?

227
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,630
没有
No.

228
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,680
抱歉  这儿很乱
Sorry, it's a mess.

229
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,340
不用为我收拾
You don't have to clean up for me.

230
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,660
当然要
Yes, I do.

231
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,430
我不想你看到这个
Wouldn't want you seeing these.

232
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,160
我昨晚穿着这个
I wore 'em last night.

233
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,840
你喜欢这个  还是我现在这身
You like these or you want the ones I'm wearing now?

234
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,190
你在赌场工作多久了
How long you been working in the casino?

235
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,570
很久了
Too long.

236
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,700
那你一定见多识广
Bet you've seen a lot.

237
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,560
当然  我什么都见过
Oh, yeah. I've seen everything.

238
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,970
我得走了  要开早会
I should get going. Got an early meeting.

239
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,920
好
Okay.

240
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,990
你想我留下来吗
Do you want me to stay?

241
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,650
我没想在这儿过夜
I wasn't planning on sleeping here.

242
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,640
又是一次一夜情吗
So, uh, another one-night stand then, huh?

243
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,840
有问题吗
Is that okay?

244
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,770
不是我的风格
Not really my thing.

245
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,270
得了吧  你肯定是老手了
Come on. You must play the field.

246
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,650
不  我不是
No, I don't.

247
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,250
但你很会调情啊
But you are such a flirt.

248
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,650
我的确会调情
I flirt, yes.

249
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,050
但我只跟喜欢的人上床
But I only sleep with someone if I'm into them.

250
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,790
而且我喜欢留下过夜
And I prefer to stick around.

251
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,980
雷米·丹顿  专情男子
Remy Danton, serial monogamist.

252
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,820
你是在开玩笑吗
This a joke?

253
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,880
抱歉  我不是...抱歉
I'm sorry. I didn't, uh... sorry.

254
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,090
如果你不是认真的  就不会有下一次了
This doesn't happen again unless it's leading somewhere.

255
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,350
我对自己想要的东西都很直接
I'm upfront about what I want, in all things.

256
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,830
不仅仅是在政治上
Not just politics.

257
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,770
每年三四次  会有十几个有钱的中国人飞过来
Three or four times a year they fly in about a dozen Chinese guys.

258
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,730
专门来烧钱
Money to burn.

259
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,620
他们把赌场一整层预留给他们
They got a whole floor of the casino reserved just for them.

260
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,060
据说能输掉几百万
Word is they throw away millions.

261
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,770
这说明不了什么
Well, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

262
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,440
中国人都爱赌博  特别是富人
The Chinese love to gamble. Especially the rich ones.

263
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,710
没错  他们会去维加斯
Yeah, in Vegas.

264
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,470
这是密苏里  远多了
This is Missouri. It's a much longer flight.

265
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,680
我想要知道
I want to find out --

266
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,680
我想要知道
I want to find out

267
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,070
这些人是从哪飞过来的
where these planes are coming from.

268
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,510
我们认识联邦航空管理局的人吗
Who do we know in the FAA?

269
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,150
我不认识  但道尔认识  我让他去打探了
I don't know anyone. But Doyle does. I already got him on it.

270
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,910
有消息就通知你
I'll text you when I hear back from Doyle.

271
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,080
我得走了
I gotta go.

272
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,500
要走了吗
You leaving?

273
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,450
是的  谢谢让我度过美好的一晚
Yeah. Thanks for last night.

274
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,440
-我很开心  -不  才没有
- I had fun. - No, you didn't.

275
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,840
你在想着别人
You were thinking of somebody else.

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,810
这是我十年戒酒纪念章
I got that one after ten years.

277
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,760
希望能给你带来好运
Hope it brings you some luck.

278
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,370
法案由艾琳·布鲁克斯发起
Elaine Brooks will be sponsoring

279
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,570
第一夫人已经认同了初稿
and the First Lady has approved the early draft.

280
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,620
杰姬  看看那板子
Jackie, take a look at the board.

281
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,330
除了你  想想还有谁能做联署人
Get a sense of who might cosponsor, besides yourself.

282
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,520
当然  我们肯定能拉来不少重量级人物
Absolutely. I'm sure we can lock down a lot of heavyweights.

283
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,030
洛莉和我会处理这事
Lorrie and I will get right on it.

284
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,580
我们该想想媒体计划
We should talk about a media plan.

285
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,160
-现在还太早了  -难道不该宣传吗
- It's premature for that. - Don't we want to get this out,

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,960
尽早开始博取支持
start building support as soon as possible?

287
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,660
-做活动和采访  -我只想看到最佳成效
- Events, interviews? - I want what's most effective.

288
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,250
媒体大肆宣扬不好
A media blitz is the wrong way to go.

289
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,560
应该始终只用一个引子
You want a single long lead

290
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,030
与法案出台同步  要有档次
that coincides with the introduction of the bill. Something classy.

291
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,630
-但要广泛支持才能...  -大肆宣传
- But you want broad support, to hit-- - A blanket strategy will

292
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,950
能博取支持  但也可能招致批评
galvanize as many detractors as supporters.

293
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,680
如果我们把理念包装得当...
Not if the message is framed in such way--

294
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,180
我们得先获取目标群体的认同  然后...
We want a key demographic to get on board, and then--

295
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,020
-请让我说完  -然后慢慢积累
- Let me finish, please. - Then we let it percolate.

296
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,390
我建议找《纽约时代杂志》的马特·贝
I suggest Matt Bai, The New York Times Magazine.

297
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,500
我喜欢这想法  非常喜欢
I like that idea. I like it very much.

298
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,390
我也是  你能和马特联系吗
So do I. Can you speak to Matt?

299
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,070
先别定下来  接触一下看看情况
No promises. Just test the waters.

300
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,690
我愿意去找他谈
I'm happy to do that.

301
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,930
我和马特关系不错  我给他打个电话
I've got a good relationship with Matt. I'll call him.

302
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,610
很好  赛斯  有进展随时通知我
Great. Seth, you keep me posted,

303
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,510
这周晚些时候再碰个头
and let's all get together later this week.

304
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,520
多谢了  杰姬
Thanks, Jackie.

305
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,370
你读一下法案  给我写份摘要
I want you to read the bill and write me a summary.

306
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,240
我们谈过之前  绝不要跟任何人透露一个字
Do not under any circumstances share it with anyone until we've spoken.

307
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,550
你不先过一遍议员名单吗
You don't want to go over the board first, at least --

308
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,220
不  不急
No. Not yet.

309
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,990
关于堕胎查到了什么
Anything on the abortion?

310
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,620
一无所获  全都核实了
Nothing. It all checks out.

311
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,690
-完全确定吗  -我方方面面都查了
- One hundred percent? - I turned over every stone.

312
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,690
-安德伍德夫人说的是实话  -我们需要猛料
- Mrs. Underwood was telling the truth. - We need something.

313
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,170
时间拖得太久了
This is taking too long.

314
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,490
安德伍德夫妇都很小心
The Underwoods are careful.

315
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,600
如果真有丑闻  肯定藏得非常深
If they have skeletons, they're buried deep.

316
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,490
这不是"如果"的问题
Not a question of "If."

317
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,760
弗兰克这样的人肯定有丑闻
Somebody like Frank is gonna have skeletons.

318
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,290
那我会挖出来的
Then I'll find them.

319
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,780
你这边一无所获  我就没法向上面交代
If you don't deliver, that means I don't deliver.

320
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,290
那不是我的风格
And I always deliver.

321
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,090
你给了我这个任务  而且期望我做好
You gave me an assignment with high expectations.

322
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,680
我不会让你失望的  但也别指望一蹴而就
I will meet them. But it's not gonna happen overnight.

323
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,390
所以别跟我颐指气使
So don't fuck with me.

324
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,560
我只是你雇来办事的人  不是你的走狗
I'm a hired gun. Not one that you own.

325
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,800
只要你能达成目的就行
As long as you hit the target.

326
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,580
那你得帮我个忙
Then I need a favor.

327
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,310
康纳·埃利斯
Connor Ellis?

328
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,410
他怎么了
What about him?

329
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,170
没他碍事的话我会拥有更多权限
I'll have more access if he isn't around.

330
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,100
你能不能找个美差把他引走
Arrange a cushy job offer for him somewhere?

331
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,320
私企还是政府部门
Private or public sector?

332
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,460
私企的
Private.

333
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,160
收入丰厚
Lots of money.

334
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,110
让他难以拒绝
Something he can't turn down.

335
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,410
我想想办法
I'll see what I can do.

336
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,430
给  先付一半
Here, this is half.

337
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,940
等我完成任务时再付我钱吧
You can pay me when I've gotten you what you want.

338
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,650
我从不事做一半  钱也拿一半
I don't take half pay for a job half done.

339
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,060
这是个很有趣的提案
It's an interesting proposal.

340
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,300
我们缺的就是一个统一的主题
What we're missing is a unified theme.

341
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,910
如果能协调全国广告投入  组织跨党派活动
If we coordinate on national ad-buys, organize crossover events,

342
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,310
开发捐款应用  应该能收效颇丰...
develop fund-raising apps, I think it would go a long way...

343
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,490
也许吧  但我觉得其他人不太可能同意
Maybe, but I doubt the leadership will go for it.

344
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,810
所以我希望你能支持我  我安排了一次会议
Which is why I'd like your support. I set up a meeting.

345
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,540
你要是能来  并且支持我的立场
If you came, and you supported my position...

346
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,990
我估计他们最终会说
I just think they're gonna end up saying

347
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,970
不能为全国范围的策略烧钱
we can't be thinning out our funds on a national strategy.

348
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,430
必须要落到实处  争取选票
This is about fieldwork, getting out the vote.

349
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,560
嗯  但至少该考虑一下吧
Right, but isn't it worth at least some consideration?

350
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,250
你了解我的  琳达  我喜欢大胆的点子
Well, you know me, Linda, I mean, I'm all for bold ideas.

351
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,080
但博奇和乌麦克  他们太守旧了
But Birch and Womack, why, they're... set in their ways.

352
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,920
我觉得他们不太可能...
I doubt very seriously that...

353
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,540
听着  弗兰克  我只想要你
Listen, Frank, all I'm asking is that

354
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,310
跟他们唱反调
you play devil's advocate with them.

355
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,690
对不起  给我点时间  我有点要紧事
Sorry, excuse me for a moment. This is important.

356
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,820
这事我很在乎的  弗兰克
I don't want to short-shrift this, Frank.

357
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,830
我知道  先让我发完这条短信
No, I know, but I just have to send this text.

358
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,450
我也不是闲人
I am busy too.

359
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,900
-请给我订靠过道的座位  -好的
- Make sure that's an aisle seat. - Of course.

360
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,550
我觉着你根本不重视这事
I don't feel as if you're taking this very seriously.

361
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,630
琳达  我向你道歉  对不起
Linda, I apologize. I am sorry.

362
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,860
你说得没错  我没有敷衍你的意思
You are absolutely right, I did not mean to sound curt.

363
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,480
你是对的  这是很重要
And you are right, this is important.

364
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,270
咱俩这就好好谈谈你的提案
You and I should go through your proposal

365
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,650
仔细推敲每一个细节
and discuss it right down to the last detail.

366
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,290
我没想让你逐字逐句地看
I am not asking you to go through it page by page,

367
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,840
只要帮忙让他们愿意认真考虑就行
just to help me initiate some meaningful dialogue.

368
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,530
-我当然会帮你了  琳达  -多谢你
- You can count on my help, Linda. - Thank you.

369
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,300
-我会让排程员联系你这边  -好的  琳达
- I will have my scheduler reach out to yours. - Thank you, Linda.

370
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,070
请接内线
Get me a secure line, please.

371
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,210
副总统来电
The vice president is on the line.

372
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,510
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

373
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,650
通常我会无视你的来电  但我今天心情不错
Normally, I would ignore your call, but I am in a good mood today.

374
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,780
你都没法破坏
Not even you could ruin it.

375
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,400
你是不是在向共和党捐款
Are you funneling money to the Republicans?

376
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,380
你到底在说什么
What on earth are you talking about?

377
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,780
给了共和党超级政治行动委员会大概两千万
About 20 million in GOP Super PACs.

378
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,550
你知道我从不给政党捐款
Now you know I never make political contributions.

379
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,680
很容易让我的投资者不高兴
That's the fastest way to upset my investors.

380
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,090
我知道钱的来路 是密苏里的一家赌场
I know the money is coming from a casino in Missouri

381
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,290
我还知道是冯给的
and I know it's from Feng.

382
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,300
冯先生和我只合作过一次
Mr. Feng and I have one co-venture together,

383
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,710
而且和赌博毫无关系
and it has nothing to do with gambling.

384
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,800
他的一架私人飞机定期飞往拉尼根的赌场
A plane that he owns flies to Lanagin's casino on a regular basis.

385
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,430
他私人时间做什么  与我无关
What he does on his own time is no business of mine.

386
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,920
你是想给领导层添乱吗
Are you trying to create chaos in the ranks?

387
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,010
共和党没有我的帮助似乎也做到了
The Republicans appear to be doing a fine job of that without my help.

388
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,200
你不会得逞的  雷蒙德
Well, it's not gonna work, Raymond.

389
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,050
这只会让民主党更团结  而不是分裂
It'll bind the democrats together, not pull us apart.

390
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,970
要我猜的话  过去十年里让民主党团结的
What has bound them together the past decade has been

391
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,780
是资助你们成为多数党的捐助
the means to achieve a majority, if I had to guess...

392
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,450
是他用钱铸就了国会
He stacked Congress.

393
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,680
铸就了我任党鞭的多数党
The majority I whipped.

394
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,370
原来一直是你在操纵  雷蒙德
So it's been you, Raymond, all along,

395
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,850
拉尼根的钱流向我们的时候也是
even when Lanagin's money was coming to us.

396
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,570
你总在做我已经否认的假设
You keep making assumptions that I have denied.

397
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,930
等季度报告一出来
Once the quarterly filings come out,

398
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,280
有电脑的人都会明白是怎么回事
anybody with a laptop is gonna see what's going on.

399
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,630
那是在九月底
The end of September.

400
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,280
还早着呢  但我很期待看到那些报告
That's a long way off. But I look forward to seeing the reports.

401
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,980
在中期选举两周前
Should make for some very interesting reading

402
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,520
那肯定是很有趣的读物
two weeks before the midterms.

403
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,410
你别想靠恐吓回到决策桌上  雷蒙德
You cannot bully your way back to the table, Raymond,

404
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,850
你也休想收买国会
just as you cannot buy the keys to Congress.

405
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,230
祝你成功维持众议院多数席位
Best of luck keeping your majority in the House.

406
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,130
我知道那对你来说意义重大
I know how much it means to you.

407
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,830
有钱给你用的时候  大家都不会多想
When the money's coming your way, you don't ask any questions.

408
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,240
但这下清楚了  拉尼根不过是个幌子
But now it's clear. Lanagin's never been anything but a front.

409
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,000
我要告诉总统吗  不
Do I tell the president? No.

410
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,470
他会想我之前怎么不知道
He'll wonder why I didn't know,

411
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,670
那我就显得消息不灵了
which makes me look uninformed,

412
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,860
或者他会责备传话的人  把他也卷进去
or he'll blame the messenger for involving him,

413
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,570
那就显得我太大意了
which makes me look careless.

414
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,730
我知道这是个陷阱  我得守住这个秘密
I know it's a trap. I must keep this to myself.

415
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,830
他问你代表谁进行购买
He wants to know who you are buying on behalf of.

416
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,720
一家名叫水星资本的对冲基金  还没上市
It's a hedge fund named Mercury Capital. It's unlisted.

417
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,120
他们需要主要投资者的名字
They need the names of the principal investors.

418
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,970
告诉他我得保护他们的身份
Tell him I have to protect identities.

419
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,060
代理人需要更多信息  他要完整的投资人名单
The broker needs more. He wants a full investor list.

420
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,500
跟他说
Say, um...

421
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,560
就说主要投资者和白宫联系密切
Say that the principal investor has strong ties to the White House.

422
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,390
他们问你是不是代表克雷顿-维斯特
And they want to know if you represent Clayton West.

423
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,640
克雷顿-维斯特吗
Clayton West?

424
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,400
-他还在等  -稍候
- He's waiting. - One second.

425
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,270
上面写了些什么
What does it say?

426
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:21,760
是关于一家中国的稀土精炼厂
It's about a refinery in China for rare earth elements.

427
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,670
跟他说是  告诉他主要投资者是雷蒙德·塔斯克
Tell him yes. Tell him the principal investor is Raymond Tusk.

428
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,610
我是道格·斯坦普
This is Doug Stamper...

429
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,710
-我们该用什么招待沃克夫妇  -氰化物
- What should we serve the Walkers? - Cyanide.

430
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,830
用来做甜点好了  主餐呢
Saving that for dessert. What about a main course?

431
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,960
哪种肉  或是蔬菜
Meat of some sort? Vegetables?

432
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,510
我实在不太擅长这方面
I mean, this isn't really my area of expertise.

433
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,890
我在想  不如找弗莱迪来
I was thinking, what about Freddy?

434
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,620
-吃肋排吗  -这样会不会太唐突
- Ribs? - Or is that gauche?

435
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,930
不会  我喜欢这主意
No. I like the idea.

436
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,510
我们可以用高档瓷器  精致配菜
Well, we can do the nice china, gourmet sides,

437
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,010
但我觉得肋排更有人情味
but I think the ribs make it more personal.

438
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,990
我去打电话
I'll make the call.

439
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,750
-你正在等的这通电话有消息吗  -还没有
- Any word on the call you're expecting? - Not yet.

440
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,750
我想他的航班应该还没到
I don't think he's landed.

441
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,610
你还真搭起来了啊
This is really coming along, isn't it?

442
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,240
你觉得小孩子气
You think it's childish.

443
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,010
总比打游戏好
I think it's better than video games.

444
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,930
把我的五千美金支票带来了吗
Do you have my check for $5,000?

445
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,240
等我涨工资了再说吧
Next time when I get a raise.

446
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,110
在赌场运气不好吗
Bad luck at the casino?

447
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,880
塔斯克知道我在这儿
So Tusk knows I'm here.

448
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,380
-丹尼尔·拉尼根知道  -塔斯克跟这事有关吗
- Daniel Lanagin knows you're here. - Is Tusk involved?

449
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,070
我为什么要承认
Why would I admit that?

450
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,040
塔斯克和你有生意来往
Tusk is in business with you.

451
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,420
你在给拉尼根汇钱
You're sending money to Lanagin.

452
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,990
拉尼根的赌场离塔斯克很近
Lanagin's casino is in Tusk's backyard.

453
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,080
你大老远飞来
You didn't fly halfway around the

454
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,160
不会就是为了证实猜测吧
world just to confirm suspicions.

455
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,230
告诉我你想要什么
Tell me what you want.

456
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,490
我们想中止资金继续流向共和党
We want the money to stop flowing to the Republicans.

457
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,810
我有什么好处
And what do I receive?

458
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,340
我说了我们想要的  现在到你了
I've told you what we want. Now it's your turn.

459
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,650
好让你再次误导我吗
Ah, so you can mislead me again.

460
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,340
形势变了  误导你对我们没有好处
Things have changed. We have nothing to gain by misleading you.

461
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,490
你觉得我的花园如何
What do you think of my garden?

462
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,220
非常漂亮
It's very beautiful.

463
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,350
只知道谈生意  就会忘记欣赏美景
When you only talk business, you stop appreciating beauty.

464
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,660
我没什么时间赏景
I don't have much time for beauty.

465
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,620
真可惜
That's a shame.

466
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,900
为了让你们这些老板有闲暇赏景
For people like you to smell the flowers,

467
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,550
我们这些手下得去除杂草
some of us have to pull the weeds.

468
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,360
-打算什么时候走  -还没买回程票
- When do you plan on leaving? - I haven't bought my return ticket yet.

很好
Good.

470
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,220
我需要考虑一晚
I'd like to think on this for a night.

471
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,200
我想你一定累坏了
And I'm sure you must be exhausted.

472
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,100
可否赏脸在这儿做客
Would you do me the honor of being my guest?

473
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,600
-非常感谢  -很好  你能休息一下了
- I'd be very grateful. - Excellent. You can get some rest.

这里还有很多美的事物可以享受

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,320
请
Please.

477
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,490
先生  格雷森先生到了 
Sir, Mr. Grayson is here.

478
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,930
赛斯
Seth.

479
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,300
你上任以来我们还一直没机会
You and I haven't really properly had the chance to sit

480
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,460
好好坐下聊聊
and have a chat since you came on board.

481
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,390
有什么需要我改进的吗  先生
Is there anything I can be doing better, sir?

482
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,900
没有  你很厉害
No. No. I'm impressed.

483
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,440
你很聪明  也有很好的职业素养
You're very smart. Excellent work ethic.

484
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,170
但更重要的是  你的洞察力很强
But more importantly, you're very observant.

485
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,690
信息就是力量
Information is power.

486
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,210
就是在这间屋子里  我妻子向世人
It was right here in this room that my wife revealed a great deal

487
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,590
吐露了惊人的消息  成千上万的人
of information to a great number of people. Millions of them.

488
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,300
先生  如果你是担心我所知道的事
Sir, if your concern is my knowledge of any discrepancies,

489
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,050
我向你保证
then let me assure you --

490
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,100
克莱尔和我都很注重隐私
Claire and I are very private people.

491
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,170
我明白你为何会不信任我
I can understand why you might mistrust me.

492
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,310
我也有敏锐的洞察力  就像你  赛斯
I'm also observant, like you, Seth.

493
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,540
但我还是会有盲点
But I still have my blind spots.

494
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,290
我绝不会想到去找马博利太太
It would have never occurred to me to reach out to Mrs. Marbury.

495
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,400
她丈夫去世了  也没留记录
Her husband was dead. He kept no records.

496
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,460
但你还是找到了  白纸黑字
And yet there it was, in black and white.

497
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,510
我很感谢你把它交给我们
I respect the fact that you brought it to us.

498
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,300
这也是我们为什么会录用你
That's what got you in the door.

499
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,770
但想要留下  这还不够
But if you want to stay, I need more.

500
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,460
你到底是什么居心
What exactly are you up to?

501
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,420
我受雇于雷米·丹顿
I was hired by Remy Danton.

502
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,330
他要我来找你们的把柄
He wants anything damaging that I can find.

503
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,400
-他有日记的备份吗  -没有
- Does he have a copy of the journal? - No copies.

504
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,940
我把原件交给了安德伍德夫人
I gave the original to Mrs. Underwood,

505
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,140
我告诉他  她的话属实
and I told him that her story checks out.

506
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,880
-你还给了他什么  -我手上没别的了
- Did you give him anything else? - I don't have anything else.

507
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,290
就算有我也不会给他
I wouldn't give it to him if I did.

508
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,270
为什么你现在才说
Why am I only hearing about this now?

509
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,230
你是美利坚合众国的副总统
Well, you're the vice president of the United States.

510
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,300
雷米在为雷蒙德·塔斯克卖命
Remy works for Raymond Tusk.

511
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,860
我夹在了两位极有权势的人之间
That puts me between two extremely powerful people.

512
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,540
得小心为好
I had to be careful.

513
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,840
雷米肯定答应给你一大笔钱吧
I'm sure that Remy's offering you a great deal of money.

514
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,260
但他只能给钱
But that's all he offers.

515
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,930
我看到你在参议院推动福利改革法案时
When I saw you push entitlement reform through the Senate,

516
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,500
立刻就明白了谁才是白宫最有权力的人
it was clear to me where the real power in the White House is.

517
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,490
我想为你这样的人效力  不是乘游艇兜风
I want to work for a man like you, not sail a yacht.

518
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,000
钱我不感兴趣
Money doesn't interest me.

519
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,700
你想让我中止和雷米的接触吗
Do you want me to cease contact with Remy?

520
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:12,100
不  我想让你找到盲点
No. I want you to find the blind spots.

521
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,840
-他有空吗  -只有几分钟
- Is he free? - For a few minutes.

522

-谢谢  -墨西哥城

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,780

where you'll meet president Soto.

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,850
我们可以在飞机上练习西班牙语
We can practice your Spanish on the plane.

525
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,940
-那是什么  -弗兰克送我的
- What is that? - Frank gave it to me.

526
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,280
-你有时间吗  -有要紧事吗
- Do you have a minute? - Yeah, is it important?

527
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,550
我要见...什么时间
I have a meeting with... When is it?

528
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,990
他已经在等了
He's already in the waiting room.

529
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,330
纽约大主教
The archbishop of New York.

530
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,120
我只想问今天晚餐要不要带礼物
I'm just wondering if we should bring a gift to dinner tonight.

531
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,590
反正是家常便饭  可以带瓶酒
Yeah, well, it's casual. Maybe a bottle of wine?

532
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,040
你和他们很熟
You know them well.

533
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,760
知道他们喜欢什么酒吗
Any idea what sort of wine they like?

534
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,600
也不算太熟
Well, not extremely well,

535
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,280
不过我可以问问他们的手下
but I'm friendly with their staff...

536
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,480
-我会去问明白的  -我可以打电话问问
- I'll figure it out. - I can make a call.

537
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,980
我在和我丈夫说话  不过谢谢你
I'm having a conversation with my husband, but thank you.

538
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,860
-好的  对不起  -我在官邸等你

艾拉  我只有15分钟吃饭

549
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,810

康纳跟我提过和中国的秘密外交渠道

553
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,210
有推测认为是一个叫冯山德的人

美国最有钱的富翁之一
One of the wealthiest men in America

560
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,240
和一个中国幕后外交官做生意
in business with an off-the-books chinese diplomat?

561
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,320
而他对华盛顿的影响力从未见报

白宫在能源危机的紧要关头

563
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,310

你到底要问什么

我想请教副总统对此的看法

有什么具体要问我的问题
A specific question for me,

567
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,600
不是问你是否要安排采访
not an interview request.

568
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,340
副总统认识雷蒙德·塔斯克吗
Does the vice president know Raymond Tusk?

569
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,610
据我了解不认识
Not to my knowledge.

570
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,560
你在隐瞒什么  赛斯
You're hiding something, Seth.

571
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,070
我没有隐瞒任何事
I'm not hiding anything.

572

克里斯蒂娜

00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,900
她总来烦我
She won't leave me alone.

577
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,380
好像她过分地想要帮忙
It's like she's trying too hard to be helpful.

578

我会让琳达和她谈谈的

579
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,640

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,830
我觉得这只是表象
I feel like it's a mask.

581
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,050
我觉得还有别的隐情
I feel like there's something else going on there.

582
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,060
比如说什么
Like what?

583
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,050
有时我走进你办公室
Sometimes, when I walk into your office

584
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,860
看见她在和你说话
and see her talking to you...

585
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,640
你们俩总一起出差
...and you've been traveling together so much.

586
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,640
天呐  特莉莎
Jesus, Tricia.

587
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,370
不是说你  但她
Oh, not you, her.

588
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,500
我认为她喜欢上你了
I think she's attracted to you.

589
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,080
而且她以前也...
And she does have a history--

590
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,710
真不敢相信我们居然在讨论这个
I can't even believe we're having this conversation.

591
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,260
我希望你把她调走
I want you to relocate her.

592
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,340
-让她去别的职位  -不行
- Find her another position - Absolutely not.

593
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,560
-我知道这似乎有点反应过度  -她是个好助理
I know it seems overboard - She's a good aide.

594
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,960
对琳达很有帮助
She's valuable to Linda,

595
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,530
所以她也是政府的人才
which makes her valuable to the administration.

596
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,260
我是你妻子
I'm your wife.

597
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,960
我应该比这些更重要
I should be more valuable than either of them.

598
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,040
-特莉莎  -她明明让我不舒服
- Tricia. - I don't understand why you're fighting me on this

599
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,330
-你怎么还跟我争  -我们马上就到弗兰克家了
- when she bothers me - we're pulling up to Frank's in two minutes.

600
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,200
真是太美味了  弗莱迪
Really, superb, Freddy.

601
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,320
我可以说
I can honestly say

602
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,560
我这辈子从没吃过这么好的肋排
I have never had better ribs in my life.

603
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,070
很高兴您喜欢
Well, I'm glad you liked you them.

604
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,030
我在《太阳报》上看到报道
You know, I read the article in the Sun

605
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,980
写你去弗莱迪的餐馆
about how you go to Freddy's.

606
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,430
希望你不介意我接受采访  弗兰克
I hope you don't mind me speaking to that reporter, Frank.

607
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,080
完全没关系
Not at all.

608
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,110
糟了  我忘了我不该这么叫你
Oh shit, I forgot I'm not supposed to call you that.

609
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,100
就算你想  我也不会让你叫我"副总统"
I wouldn't let you call me "Vice President" even if you tried.

610
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,160
而且我完全不介意
And I didn't mind at all.

611
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,450
我觉得那篇报道非常好
I thought the article was great.

612
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,840
报道出来以后生意一下兴隆了不少
Well, it's been a big bump in business since it came out.

613
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,800
街上排起大队
I'm talking lines around the block.

614
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,820
现在你不是唯一去那里的白人了
You're not the only white person to show up there now.

615
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,270
我先走了  明天还要早起呢
Well, I'm gonna call it a night. I got a early start in the morning.

616
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,750
很高兴见到你们  总统先生  沃克夫人
It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. President. Mrs. Walker.

617
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,020
我们也很高兴
A pleasure. Truly.

618
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,810
谢谢  弗莱迪
Thanks, Freddy.

619
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,920
随时为你效劳
Always.

620
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,440
不  我不用了  谢谢
No. None -- none for me, thanks.

621
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,440
总统先生  一块派有益心灵
Mr. President, a slice of pie is good for the soul.

622
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,990
-我吃饱了  -吃一块派没关系的
- I'm stuffed. - You can have a slice of pie.

623
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,880
真的不用了  谢谢你  弗兰克
I'm fine, really, but thank you, Frank.

624
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,330
我要一块
I'll have some.

625
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,150
我们俩也要
For the two of us, as well.

626
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,510
她又要逼我多跑五英里把它消化掉了
Now she is gonna make me run another five miles to work off this puppy.

627
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,000
你疯了吗  我几乎跟不上你
Are you crazy? I can barely keep up with you.

628
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,880
-你比我快多了  -你们一起跑步吗
- You're so much faster than me. - You two run together?

629
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,530
是的  时间很难找  但我们还是挤出时间了
Yes. It's hard to find the time, but somehow we find it.

630
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,140
没错  而且只有我和他在一起
We do. And it's something that's just ours, you know?

631
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,930
是啊  只有咱俩  再加八个特情局特工
Yes. Just ours. And about eight Secret Service agents.

632
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,240
你们俩能一起跑步真是太好了
That's so nice that you have that together.

633
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,980
真希望加勒特和我能有更多时间做那样的事
I wish Garrett and I had more time for things like that.

634
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,730
我们曾一起去上过动感单车课
We did take a spinning class together once.

635
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,430
你们真该看看加勒特在手把上弯着腰的样子
You should have seen Garrett hunched over the handlebar --

636
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,100
行了
Please.

637
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,880
再来点酒吗
Would you like some more wine?

638
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,750
好的  谢谢  我看到你送他的沙袋了
I would, thank you. I saw the punching bag you gave him.

639
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,430
这样吧  我来一块派吧
You know what? I will have a slice of pie.

640
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,220
请给总统上一块派
Pie, please. For the president.

641
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,140
谢谢
Thank you.

642
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,260
我从头到尾读了一遍  我觉得很好
I read it front to back. I think it's good.

643
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,550
可能会掀翻天  但也许这正是我们需要的
It'll cause a shit-storm, but maybe that's what we need.

644
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,160
不能在中期选举间
Not during the midterms.

645
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,780
我看不出有招致批评的风险
I don't see how we take flack.

646
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,160
我们可是想减少强奸啊
We're trying to curtail rape, for godsakes.

647
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,850
当然  一些右翼人士会老调重弹
Sure, some right-wingers will do their usual song and dance--

648
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,730
先别急  我想自己看过再说
Hold off. I want to read it myself first.

649
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,080
我们向副总统承诺我们会找联署人...
We promised the Vice President we'd have cosponsors...

650
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,280
我知道我们承诺了什么  我们要拖延
I know what we promised, and we're gonna stall.

651
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,610
-不要把草案泄露出去  -但你知道法案的要点
- Don't disseminate the draft. - But you know the gist of the bill.

652
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,980
-我不明白为什么不能  -洛莉
- I don't see why we can't-- - Lorrie.

653
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,870
好吧  那你先看着
All right, I'll leave it with you.

654
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,090
-还有别的事吗  -不  没事了
- Anything else? - No. I think we're good.

655
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,070
好吧  那我走了
All right. Then I'm off.

656
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,100
跟老公的约会之夜  还不如杀了我
Date night with the husband. Slit my wrists, please.

657
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,310
差不多了就回家  好吗
Go home at some point, OK?

658
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,600
国会大厦明天早上还会在这里
The Capitol will still be here in the morning.

659
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
这可真棒
This is really something.

660
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,970
还没完工呢
Ways to go yet.

661
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,450
谁赢了这场战役  北方还是南方
Now, who won this battle? The North or the South?

662
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,260
双方都伤亡惨重  没有明显的赢家
Massive casualties on both sides. No clear winner.

663
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,300
你怎么会有时间干这个
How do you find the time?

664
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,460
我零零散散挤出半小时  能让我放松
I carve out a half hour here and there. Helps me relax.

665
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,350
我都忘了什么叫放松了
I've forgotten the meaning of that word.

666
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,490
送您沙袋就是干这个用的
Well, that's what the punching bag is for.

667
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,130
说得没错
It's very true.

668
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,130
一点就行  特莉莎和我过会儿该走了
Just a little. Tricia and I should get going soon.

669
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,180
您这样的话一个任期都挺不过去  总统先生
You're never gonna make it through this first term, Mr. President.

670
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,890
此话怎讲
How do you mean?

671
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,890
这样可不行  让压力渐渐累积
Well, not like this. Letting the stress creep in.

672
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,500
您是要跑马拉松  而不是冲刺
You need to run the marathon, not the sprint.

673
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,970
您应该学会享受忙里偷闲
You need to enjoy these little moments of escape.

674
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,970
多倒一点吧
You can pour more than that.

675
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,820
谢谢
Thank you.

676
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,900
-这是联军还是叛军  -联军  先生
- This Union or rebel? - Union, sir.

677
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,690
别再叫"先生""总统先生"  叫名字吧
Enough "Sirs" and "Mr. Presidents." Call me by my name.

678
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,380
我尊重您的职位  不能那么做
I respect the office too much for that.

679
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,950
私下里没关系
When we're in private, it's OK.

680
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,040
今晚  我不必扮演总统的角色
Tonight, I don't have to be president.

681
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,450
我不是有意要介入你们的私生活
I don't mean to get involved in your personal life.

682
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,560
不  是我提起来的
Oh, no. I brought it up.

683
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,270
你真是为了克里斯蒂娜吗
Is this really about Christina?

684
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,910
或者是别的什么事的表征
Or maybe it's just a symptom of something else?

685
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,210
-比如呢  -我不知道
- Like what? - I don't know.

686
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,520
我几乎见不到他
I barely see him at all.

687
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:00,480
他现在很紧张  海外局势
He's so wound up in everything that's going on overseas,

688
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,370
中期选举  经济危机
the elections, the economy.

689
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,030
他当州长的时候  也不容易
When he was governor, it wasn't a cake walk,

690
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,130
但跟现在是不能比了
but it was nothing like this.

691
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,340
你和弗兰克是怎么做到的
How do you and Frank do it?

692
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,100
你们看起来那么亲密
You both seem so close.

693
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,000
我们对彼此很坦诚
We're honest with each other.

694
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,000
我们什么都不会藏着掖着
We don't sweep anything under the rug.

695
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,970
特莉莎  如果这事让你很困扰  和他谈谈
Tricia, if it's eating at you, make him talk about it.

696
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,040
白宫不过是一时的  婚姻是一辈子的
The White House is finite. Your marriage is for life.

697
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,780
-早上好  -好
- Good morning. - Morning.

698
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,770
不喜欢这道汤吗
You don't like your soup?

699
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,260
我用不好筷子
I'm not good with chopsticks.

700
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,700
我觉得与昨晚的女伴相比
I think you'll like this soup more than you liked the

701
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,930
这道汤会更合你口味
two companions I sent you last night.

702
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,810
昨晚我太累了
I was tired.

703
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,200
你考虑过我们昨天说的事了吗
Have you had a chance to think about what we discussed yesterday?

704
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,880
在中国  接到礼物推辞一次是礼貌
In China, it's polite to refuse a gift the first time.

705
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,240
也许我该拒绝你的礼物
Maybe I should refuse yours.

706
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,530
如果不知道你想要什么  我们没法送你礼物
We can't offer you a gift if I don't know what you want.

707
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,030
杰斐逊港大桥
The Port Jefferson Bridge.

708
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,810
你在私下接触时把项目撤下了
You pulled it, during the back-channel.

709
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,580
-我改主意了  -为什么
- I changed my mind. - Why?

710
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,340
我有盟友想修建这座桥
I have allies who want the bridge.

711
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,300
没了桥  他们就会变成敌人
Without it, they become my enemies.

712
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,760
-我已经两次受审  -腐败指控
- I've been put on trial twice. - Corruption charges.

713
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,370
在中国  我这个层次的人都会贿赂该贿赂的人
Everyone in China who works on this level pays who they need to pay.

714
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,350
杀掉该杀的人
And they kill who they need to kill.

715
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,920
总有人莫名消失  斯坦普先生
People disappear all the time, Mr. Stamper.

716
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,940
我也可能消失  你也可能消失
I could disappear. You could disappear.

717
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,340
别再去赌场  我们就给你这座桥
Stop the junkets, and we'll get you the bridge.

718
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,800
先把桥定下来
The bridge comes first.

719
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,340
副总统骗过我
The vice president has lied to me before.

720
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,770
我要看到他诚意的证明  才会停止资金流
I need proof of his commitment. Then the money will stop.

721
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,440
斯坦普先生  请用
Please, Mr. Stamper. Eat.

722
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,810
你接下来要坐很久的航班呢
You have a long flight ahead of you.

723
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,550
如果你觉得你一定要这么做
If it's what you feel you need to do.

724
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,610
安德伍德夫人  我在这儿工作很愉快
I've had a great experience here, Mrs. Underwood.

725
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:22,040
但是这个机会我实在没法错过
But this is an opportunity I can't pass up.

726
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,660
-我猜钱肯定给得不少  -确实
- I imagine the pay is substantial. - It is.

727
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,830
但不只是钱的事  在太空探索技术公司有上升空间
But it's not just that. There's room to grow at SpaceX.

728
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,390
如果你决定了  我不会劝你留下来的
Well, if your mind's made up, I won't try and convince you to stay.

729
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,640
说实话  我最初来的时候
The truth is... when I first came on board,

730
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,820
我以为是同时为你和你丈夫工作
I thought it was to work for both you and your husband.

731
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,650
别误会  为你工作我十分荣幸
Don't get me wrong, it's been an honor working for you,

732
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:43,510
但我没想到要和赛斯一起工作
but I didn't foresee having to work with Seth.

733
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,840
-你俩有些不合  -没错
- You're not very fond of each other. - No.

734
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,180
这不是问题  我们都是专业人士
Which is fine. We're professionals.

735
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,080
但我觉得这样最好
But I think this is for the best.

736
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,050
雇佣出色人才的问题就在于
Well, the problem with hiring great people

737
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,810
每个人都想把他们撬走
is everyone wants to steal them away.

738
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,890
很感激你能这么善解人意
I appreciate you being so understanding.

739
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,840
-我们会想念你的  康纳  -谢谢
- You'll be missed, Connor.  - Thank you.

740
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,210
赛斯  是我  他刚离开了
Seth, it's me. He just left.

741
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,650
和他谈谈  然后发一篇新闻稿
Talk to him and put out a press release.

742
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,430
尽可能地平稳过渡
Let's make this as smooth as possible.

743
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,770
我感兴趣的有两个机会
It's two opportunities I'm interested in.

744
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,600
家族连锁餐厅  和零售烧烤酱
Family-oriented restaurant chain and a retail barbecue sauce.

745
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,890
具体是什么内容
What would that look like?

746
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,890
我们给你一笔预付款来购买你的品牌使用权
We give you an upfront payment for the right to use your brand.

747
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,310
不管这两项投资是否失败
Either venture fails, or they both do,

748
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,900
那些钱都还是你的
you still get to keep that money.

749
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,990
那是多少钱啊
How much money we talking?

750
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,930
只要你签合同  九万五千
95,000 as soon as you sign.

751
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,380
如果买卖成功了  你还会有收益分红
And then you'd have a share of the profits if we're successful.

752
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,800
分红怎么分
What would the shares be?

753
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,680
这样吧  我草拟一份合同
I'll tell you what. Let me draw up papers.

754
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,070
你好好看一遍  然后给你的律师看一遍
You look them over. You show them to your lawyer.

755
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,610
我没有律师
I don't have a lawyer.

756
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,990
那你得找一个了
Well, you should get one.

757
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,560
我不想让你觉得自己被骗了
I don't want you to feel like you're being cheated.

758
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,500
你还有疑虑
You're skeptical.

759
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,070
听着
Look,

760
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,350
要不是想买肋排
money usually don't come through that door

761
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,830
一般没人送钱上门
unless it's looking for a plate of ribs.

762
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,970
我们想卖成千上百的肋排
And we want to sell thousands of those plates.

763
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,310
如果加盟店建立起来  将数以百万计
Millions, if the franchise builds.

764
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,430
《太阳报》的文章让你名声大噪
The Sun article put you on the map.

765
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,570
让我们用弗莱迪烧烤连锁店撑起这个名声
Let's fill up that map with Freddy's barbecue joints.

766
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,240
-你在看什么  -你说什么
- What are you looking at?  - Excuse me?

767
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,190
刀在厨房里
The knives are in the kitchen.

768
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,370
你有枪  不用一直盯着我  
You have a pistol. You can stop staring.

769
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,070
他来了吗  丹
Is he in here? Dan!

770
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,320
-你好吗  -挺好
- How are you? - Good.

771
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,390
要喝一杯吗
Care for a drink?

772
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,250
不用了
I'm good.

773
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,550
我们去客厅吧  那里更舒服
Well, let's, uh, go into the living room. It's more cozy.

774
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,030
这里就挺好
Uh, I'm just fine where I am.

775
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,230
也行  你先下去吧
Well, all right. Uh, thank you.

776
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,340
是  先生
Yes, sir.

777
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,040
你一定告诉雷蒙德我请你来这儿了吧
I'm sure you've told Raymond that I've asked you here.

778
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,160
哪个雷蒙德
Raymond who?

779
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,260
在我面前你不用装  丹
Oh, you don't have to pretend, Dan.

780
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,950
冯证实了你的企图
Feng confirmed what you're up to.

781
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,200
我没听过这人
Name doesn't ring a bell.

782
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,280
我有航班记录
I have flight records.

783
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,740
他的一架飞机多次飞往堪萨斯城
One of his planes to Kansas City on multiple occasions.

784
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,710
我们还要继续玩下去吗
Do we really have to play this game?

785
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,670
我来是因为我以为你有什么好提议
I came here because I thought you might have something to offer.

786
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,520
不如直接切入正题吧
Why don't we just skip to that part.

787
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,000
你一直是个忠诚的捐助人  丹
You've been a loyal contributor, Dan.

788
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,340
你为我们募集资金
You've thrown us fundraisers.

789
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,610
有很多我们握手的照片
There are pictures of you and I shaking hands.

790
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,130
所以无论你这一季度做了什么  
So whatever you've done this quarter

791
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,300
都可以一笔勾销
can be forgotten.

792
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,270
但你的资金得停止流往错误的方向
But I need the money to stop flowing in the wrong direction.

793
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,790
我还在等你的提议
I'm still waiting for the offer.

794
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,910
你是个商人  丹
You're a businessman, Dan,

795
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,890
-我知道利益是你的首要考虑  -没错
- so I know your primary concern is profits. - Well, that's right.

796
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,280
但我现在要给你比金钱更有价值的东西
But I'm offering you something that's far more valuable than money:

797
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,970
直通白宫的关系线
a direct line to the White House.

798
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,510
听上去太含糊
That sounds vague to me.

799
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,610
我对印第安人事务局有影响力
I have influence over the BIA.

800
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,430
关于联邦赌博立法
Over federal gambling legislation.

801
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,850
我已经靠捐款买到了这种影响力
The sort of influence that my contributions have already bought.

802
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,970
但我没有直接参与  你在总统那边也说不上话
Not with my direct involvement and the president's ear.

803
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,770
你知道我最喜欢钱哪一点吗
You know what I like about money?

804
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,000
我能把钱摞在桌子上
I can stack it on a table, like this one.

805
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,290
我能用尺子去丈量它
I can measure it with a yardstick.

806
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,160
我能看见它  闻到它的味道  
I can see it, smell it,

807
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,350
用它买任何东西
buy things with it.

808
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:22,320
房子  车子  衣服  实实在在的东西
Houses, cars, clothes. Things that are real.

809
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,580
你得让我看到更多诚意
You're gonna have to show up with more than beads.

810
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,440
丹  我请你来我家是因为我认为
Dan, I invited you to my home because I thought --

811
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,690
从后门
Through the back door.

812
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,810
你说什么  
Excuse me?

813
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,740
让我从后门进来  像佣人一样
Through the back door, like a servant.

814
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,810
特勤局要求所有人都从后门进
The Secret Service makes everyone come in that way.

815
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:37,780
这是防范措...
It's a precautionary meas--

816
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,290
除非你给我的钱能多过塔斯克
Unless you're gonna offer me more money than Tusk --

817
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,100
而我认为你做不到
and I don't think that you can --

818
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,560
否则我们就没什么商量余地
there's little left for us to talk about.

819
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,610
我现在向你提供机会和
I am offering you an alliance with a man

820
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,860
在宾夕法尼亚大街1600号工作的人结盟
who goes to work every day at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

821
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,860
{\an8}即白宫

822
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,230
我从不信任任何白人
I don't place my faith in any white man.

823
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,420
尤其是为联邦政府做事的白人
Especially one that works for the federal government.

824
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,280
我和你一样  丹
I am just like you, Dan.

825
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,740
我知道白手起家  
I know what it means to start from nothing,

826
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,040
杀出一条路的艰辛
to have to fight your way --

827
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,470
你根本不知道我走到今天的艰辛
You know nothing about what it means to be me.

828
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,930
你所谓的白手起家  比我起步的时候要阔绰得多
Your version of nothing was light years ahead of where I started.

829
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,330
我尊重你  丹  我重视你
I respect you, Dan. I take you serious--

830
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,930
等我在乎你的尊重时  我会告诉你的
I'll let you know when I give a fuck about your respect.

831
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,900
郝利戴  送拉尼根出去
Holiday? Show Lanagin out.

832
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,830
我知道后门在哪
I know where the back door is.

833
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,450
弗兰西斯
Francis?

834
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,040
没摔坏  我能修好
It's not broken. I can fix it.

835
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,210
别管它了  我一会儿收拾
Leave it. I'll clean up later.

836
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,100
我们去跑步  让你消消火  
Let's go for a run. Burn off some of this steam.

837
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,790
先生
Sir?

838
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,660
我马上出来
I'll be out in a moment.

839
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,250
我先走  你赶上我
I'll go ahead. You catch up.

840
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,020
你上飞机前为什么没联系我
Why didn't you reach out, before you got on a plane?

841
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,520
我担心我们的通讯被监视了
I was afraid our communication might be monitored.

842
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,900
和拉尼根进展如何
Where are we with Lanagin?

843
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,820
没有进展  你和冯呢
Nowhere. Where are we with Feng?

844
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,580
我们也许有条路  但不太好走
We might have an option, but it's gonna be tricky.

846
00:45:48,880 --> 00:46:18,880
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2010年以前  美国选举法规定
任何个人和组织向政治行动委员会捐款
每次选举不能超过5000美元
但是这个规定因为美国最高法院的一个判决而改变
2008年  美国前第一夫人希拉里作为候选人参加民主党总统初选
一个叫做"公民联合"的组织制作了一个攻击希拉里的纪录片打算在电视上播放
但地方法院裁定该纪录片性质上等同于竞选广告
在播出时间和制作费用上违反了选举法的有关规定
"公民联合"于是将此事诉诸最高法院
2010年1月  最高法院的9名法官以5比4的投票结果
裁定当时施行的相关选举法法规违宪
根据这个判决  美国的商业公司  工会组织和社会团体
向政治行动委员会捐款时  不应该有数额限制
超级政治行动委员会应运而生

848
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:48,880
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}"Super PAC"是"独立支出政治活动委员会"的别称
在美国  候选人参加政治选举
或者一些社会机构想要对各级政府议会的立法行为进行影响和游说时
需要成立"政治委员会"来向社会募集资金
而这种独立的委员会之所以被媒体冠以"超级"的绰号
则是因为个人或机构向这种委员会进行捐款没有金额上限
在美国这样一个金钱和政治紧密难分的社会里
"无上限"的捐款  自然会带来"超级"的政治影响
"超级委员会"同普通政治行动委员会的不同之处还在于
该机构不能同其所支持的候选人进行沟通
亦不能在政治活动中进行协调
就是说  如果一个"超级委员会"支持某个共和党候选人
想要在报纸上登广告替该候选人宣传拉票
事先不能知会该候选人  而候选人也不能对广告内容发表意见

850
00:46:48,880 --> 00:47:18,880
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2012年的共和党总统初选
是"超级委员会"首次登上全国性的政治舞台
根据美国联邦选举委员会公布的数据
在2012美国总统大选初选阶段
有近四百家"超级委员会"筹集了一亿多美元的竞选资金
针对2004年美国议会选举的一项统计结果显示
90%以上的选举中都是资金最多的候选人获胜
毫无疑问  在美国的政治制度中
金钱是一个不可或缺的基本元素
"超级委员会"便是这种金钱政治中最新出场的一支生力军
