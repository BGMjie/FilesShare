{\an8}副总统维护总统

15
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,090
你讲的是法律
You're parsing the law.

16
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,500
我讲的则是精神层面的法则
And I'm talking about a spiritual code.

17
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,220
保密协议是一份契约
Confidentiality is a covenant.

18
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,860
不仅在我和接受我咨询的人之间成立
Not only between myself and those I counsel,

19
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,340
在我和上帝之间也成立
but also between myself and the Lord.

20
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,510
拉金医生  我现在重点关注的是洗钱案
Dr. Larkin, my chief focus here is the money laundering.

21
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,960
如果总统提到过冯山德
If the President brought up Xander Feng,

22
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,380
雷蒙德·塔斯克  还有阿道希赌场
Raymond Tusk, the Adohi Casino--

23
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,930
不管重点是什么
It doesn't matter what the focus is.

24
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,200
我都不能向你透露私人谈话的内容
I can't share anything we discussed privately.

25
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,020
宗教指导受法律保护
Religious guidance is protected.

26
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,460
但你也提供专业的心理咨询
But you were also conducting professional therapy.

27
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,400
这我从未承认过
I never claimed that.

28
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,880
基斯先生及太太已经证实了
Mr. And Mrs. Keith confirmed as much.

29
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,190
我们是去了他们家
We were at their house.

30
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,200
但他们并没有参与谈话
But they didn't participate in any of our conversations.

31
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,170
他们又怎么可能知道
So how would they know?

32
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,520
你是说你只提供宗教咨询吗
So you're saying you only gave religious counsel?

33
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,820
这是我对我工作的理解
That's how I choose to interpret it.

34
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,320
总统夫妇从没去过你的教堂
The President and his wife have never once attended your church.

35
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,580
甚至都和你不是一个教派的
They're not even the same denomination.

36
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,630
无关紧要
Irrelevant.

37
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,160
法律上可紧要得很
Not legally speaking.

38
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,200
我绝对能说服法官发传票给你
I'm certain I can convince a judge to issue a subpoena

39
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,500
因为你并非总统夫妇正式的宗教导师
on the grounds that you weren't their legitimate spiritual advisor.

40
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,350
那是你的特权
Which is your prerogative.

41
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,020
但我会上诉  我肯定会
But I can appeal. And I would.

42
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,320
那你一定败诉
You'd lose.

43
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,810
除非对方放弃保密权利
The only circumstance by which I would talk

44
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,120
我绝不会回答你的问题
is if someone personally waived their privilege.

45
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,030
否则我宁可被判蔑视法庭
Otherwise I'd rather face contempt of court.

46
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,170
这事关道德
It's a matter of ethics.

47
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,050
总统先生  您又把沙袋挪回来了
Mr. President. Ah, you brought it back in.

48
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,160
弗洛伊德·梅威瑟[著名拳击手]今早来白宫参观
Floyd Mayweather visited the White House this morning.

49
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,410
我觉得他看见这个肯定很兴奋
I thought he'd get a kick out of it.

50
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,770
他没打几拳
Did he have a go at it?

51
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,630
他打了套组合拳  我都担心把沙袋打爆了
He threw a combination I thought would bust the stitching loose.

52
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,790
那场面一定很好看
Well, that must have been a treat to watch.

53
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,950
他告诉我  这不仅仅是力量的问题
He was telling me it's not just about the power.

54
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,480
比他更有力量的拳手不少
Plenty of boxers are more powerful than he is.

55
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,620
关键是他的战术  他的准头和速度
No, it's his tactics, his precision, his speed.

56
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,320
最重要的一点  就是他的反击
Most important? His counter punch.

57
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,580
他躲闪腾挪  选择最完美的时机一拳制胜
He dances and dodges and then picks the perfect moment to strike.

58
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,000
听着耳熟吗
Does that sound familiar?

59
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,890
什么意思  先生
How do you mean, sir?

60
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,380
你送我这个沙袋  作为友谊的表示
You gave this to me as a gesture of friendship.

61
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,060
但我现在看着它  却感受不到友谊
When I look at this now, I don't see friendship.

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,900
我看到的是算计
I see calculation.

63
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,090
你算计我  弗兰克
You set me up, Frank.

64
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,560
什么
What?

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,800
你的私下接触  还有特别检察官
Your back channeling. The special prosecutor.

66
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,530
再想想雷蒙德  琳达  还有吉姆·马修斯
When I think about Raymond, about Linda, about Jim Matthews...

67
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,480
您错了  先生
You are wrong, sir.

68
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,790
这是邓巴就婚姻咨询问的问题
Questions from Dunbar about the marriage counseling.

69
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,220
"那是大海里的一根针  还不是邓巴要找的那根"
"It's a needle in the haystack she's not trying to find."

70
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,220
这是你的原话  她还真就捞着了
That's what you said. Well, she found the needle.

71
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,660
我非常震惊  我绝没
I am shocked, sir. I -- I never --

72
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,860
你震惊才怪  你想削弱我的力量
Like hell you are. You want to deminish me.

73
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,290
削弱您的力量
Diminish you?

74
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,170
为你2016年挑战我打基础
Laying the groundwork for a challenge in 2016.

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,850
恕我无礼  但您这论调太荒唐了
I am sorry to have to say this, sir, but you are being ludicrous.

76
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,810
你真以为我瞎了吗
Do you really think I'm so blind?

77
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,430
从没有哪个副总统挑战过在位总统
A vice president has never challenged a sitting president.

78
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,400
你往上爬的过程中已经做过不少别人不会做的事了
You've climbed the ladder doing things other men would never do.

79
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,340
全都是为了服务于您和本党利益
Always in service to you and the party.

80
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,320
交出行程记录是你的主意
It was you idea to hand over those logs.

81
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,800
是你让白宫和中国扯上了关系  还有赌场
You connected the White House to China, the casino --

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,860
是雷蒙德·塔斯克让我们与中国和赌场扯上了关系
Raymond Tusk entangled us with China and the casino.

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,120
要不是我及时干预
And if I hadn't intervened --

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,870
你没有弗洛伊德那套腾挪的本事  我识破你了
You can't dodge and duck like Floyd. I've learned your moves now.

85
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,060
当了总统就易多疑  您别这样  先生
This office breeds paranoia. Don't give into it, sir.

86
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,610
要不是会引人非议  我就会要求你辞职了
I'd ask for your resignation if it wouldn't make things worse.

87
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,310
但从此刻开始  我不想听你的任何建议
But from this moment forward, I don't want to hear your voice,

88
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,890
也不想看见你
I don't want to see your face.

89
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,170
再让我看见你  我就让你吃不了兜着走
And if I do, I will put you on your god damn back.

90
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,140
我被驱逐了  我成功将总统和其他人隔开
Exile. I've managed to isolate the president from everyone.

91
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,430
包括我自己
Including myself.

92
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,260
"夏普女众议员淋漓尽致地展现了
"Congresswoman Sharp is a  perfect example

93
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,630
军方是如何将我们洗脑
of how the military brainwashes us

94
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,080
从而绝对服从党派路线的
into never questioning the party line.

95
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,380
她对法案的反对是可耻的
Her opposition to the bill is disgraceful.

96
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,770
这会使数以千计的男性和女性
It will cost thousands of men and women

97
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,050
得不到他们应得的公正
 the justice they deserve,

98
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,160
甚至会毁掉一些人的生活"
and some of them their lives."

99
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,080
这都是梅根·汉纳希的话  他们有失公正
Those are Megan Hennessey's words. They're biased.

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,140
这是克莱尔教她说的  汉纳希不过是传声筒
They're Claire's words. Hennessey's just the mouthpiece.

101
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,940
为什么文中还说我拒绝置评
Why does it say here that I declined to comment?

102
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,250
你说过  麻烦事能躲就躲
You said you didn't want to kick up dust if we could avoid it.

103
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,780
这是《纽约时代杂志》  你应该告诉我的
It's the New York fucking Times. You should've let me know.

104
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,870
是我的决定  我承担责任
That was my call. I'll take the blame.

105
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,880
查明汉纳希接下来会在哪里出现
Find out when Hennessey's next appearance is.

106
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,170
我要搞垮这个婊子
I'm gonna beat this bitch down.

107
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,840
我知道她针对你  但是针对她的话...
I know she went after you, but going after her is --

108
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,700
不是她  是克莱尔·安德伍德
Not her. Claire Underwood.

109
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,300
我知道加勒特可能会产生误解
I understand how Garrett might misconstrue things,

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,400
毕竟现在他压力很大
given the pressure he's under.

111
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,860
但你肯定不会相信吧
But you can't honestly believe it yourself.

112
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,220
我已经不知道该相信什么了
I don't know what to believe anymore.

113
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,610
弗兰西斯非常沮丧  他只是想帮忙
Francis is devastated. All he wants to do is help,

114
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,160
但他觉得自己受到了冤枉
but he feels like he's being unfairly accused.

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,710
我也不想相信  克莱尔  但加勒特确信不疑
I don't want to believe it, Claire, but Garrett is convinced.

116
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,140
你能跟他谈谈吗
Will you talk to him?

117
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,790
我现在得集中精力维护我的家庭
I have to concentrate on keeping my family together right now.

118
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,540
而不是跟他争吵关于...
Not getting into arguments over --

119
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,750
如果弗兰西斯真有什么图谋
If Francis were really up to something,

120
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,180
那他怎么不直接把咨询的事告诉邓巴
don't you think he would have told Dunbar about the therapy?

121
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,020
他逼我们交出记录就等于那么做了
He basically did by forcing us to hand over the logs.

122
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,630
那是你丈夫的决定
Your husband chose to hand them over.

123
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,660
如果他拒绝  弗兰西斯是不会逼他的
If he'd said no, Francis wouldn't have pressed the issue.

124
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,610
我不想跟你争这个  克莱尔
I don't want to debate this with you, Claire.

125
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,680
我只求你好好想想这件事  特莉莎
All I'm asking is that you really think this through, Tricia.

126
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,840
他现在跟你在一起吗
Is he with you right now?

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,950
谁
Who?

128
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,100
弗兰克
Frank.

129
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,830
没有  只有我和你
No. It's just you and me.

130
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
我要挂电话了
I want to get off the phone.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,750
拜托你跟加勒特谈谈好吗
Will you please talk to Garrett?

132
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,130
再见  克莱尔
Goodbye, Claire.

133
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,570
你怎么看
What do you think?

134
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,310
我不觉得她会抛开丈夫站在我这边
I don't think she's going to side with me instead of her husband.

135
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,420
除了跟你  特莉莎还跟别人说过阿普唑仑的事吗
Did Tricia tell anyone else about the Xanax besides you?

136
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,420
{\an8}镇静抗焦虑药

137
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,380
应该没有  她对此非常敏感
I doubt she would. She's very sensitive about it.

138
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,920
她要是跟别人说过  我们就可以把消息传出去
If she'd only told someone else, then we could just leak it.

139
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,290
但是这太明显了
But it'll be too obvious.

140
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,460
医生
The doctor.

141
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,840
他在保护他们  他什么都不会说的
He's protecting them. He won't say anything.

142
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,950
除非他们放弃保密特权
Unless they waive the privilege.

143
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,370
那对他们可没有好处
They have absolutely nothing to gain by that.

144
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,760
但是对我们有
But we do.

145
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,470
你得去见塔斯克
You have to meet with Tusk.

146
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,240
我背叛了他  他为什么还要见我
Why would he talk to me after I back-stabbed him?

147
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,850
正因为如此他才会见你
That's precisely why he'll talk to you.

148
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,080
我不能去圣路易斯  你知道的...
Well, I can't go to St. Louis. You know --

149
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,630
塔斯克会来东部  你要做的就是找到他
Tusk will come east. Your job is to get in the same room with him.

150
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,420
-什么计划  -雷米·丹顿
- What's the play? - Remy Danton.

151
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,040
去  安排我跟杜兰特面谈
Go. Get me Durant, in person.

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,000
我这就去
I'll set it up.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,650
道格  一定确保其他方面我们万无一失
And Doug? Let's make sure we're airtight on everything else.

154
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,210
不能有软肋
No Achilles heel.

155
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,850
是  先生
Yes, sir.

156
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,200
"灾难来临了"  用混乱对抗混乱的人说
"Cry, 'Havoc,'" Said he who fought chaos with chaos,

157
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,510
"让我们释放战争恶魔"
"And let slip the dogs of war."

158
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,790
失约  数周不联络  你知道规矩
Missed appointments. No contact in weeks. You know the rules.

159
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,930
我要跟格林特工谈
I'd like to speak to Agent Green, please.

160
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,970
你想干什么
What are you up to?

161
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,820
给格林打电话
Put Green on the fucking line, please.

162
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,060
不管你想说什么  都可以跟我说
Anything you have to say, you can discuss it with me.

163
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,080
我要说的事远远超出了你的级别
What I have to say is way above your pay grade.

164
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,960
我怎么关掉这破玩意
Where do I turn off this shit?

165
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,240
看看左边的那块屏幕
Look at the other screen, to the left.

166
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,550
这是什么
What is this?

167
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,900
这是美国电话电报公司八个数据中心的访问网格
That is the access grid to all eight of AT&T's data centers.

168
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,930
所以你还是解开手铐
So what do you say you un-cuff me

169
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,430
然后告诉格林特工我在等他的电话吧
and tell Agent Green I'll be waiting for his call?

170
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,320
我正在试图修复与中国的关系
I'm trying to repair relations with China.

171
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,990
给冯政治庇护就是一记耳光
Giving Feng asylum would be a slap in the face.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,400
加勒特有麻烦  他得表现出决心
Garrett's in trouble. He needs to appear resolute.

173
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,130
我们的总统有多强  我们就有多强
We're only as strong as the president we serve.

174
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,290
我们必须拯救他
We have to rescue him.

175
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,130
你怎么能确定他的证词不会扯上白宫
How can you be sure his testimony won't implicate the White House?

176
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,970
他知道谁有奶  谁是娘
He knows where his bread is buttered.

177
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,030
你这不是要拯救总统
This isn't about you saving the president.

178
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,870
-当然是  -这不是第一次了  弗兰克
- Of course it is. - We've been down this road before, Frank.

179
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,180
迈克尔·科恩  亚当·嘉乐威
Michael Kern, Adam Galloway.

180
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,390
我想当国务卿
I wanted to become secretary of state

181
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,310
是为了进行有成效的外交
in order to engage in productive diplomacy,

182
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,220
而不是全职损失控制
not full-time damage control.

183
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,130
所以我们要让加勒特回到正轨
Which is why we have to put Garrett back on his feet.

184
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,220
你是想让他脱轨吧  弗兰克
You want him on his ass, Frank.

185
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,350
是总统这么跟你说的吗
Is this what the president told you?

186
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,180
他现在太多疑了  凯茜
He's paranoid, Cathy.

187
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,100
他想让大家跟我反目
He's trying to turn people against me.

188
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,230
是你自己的行为让大家跟你反目
You're turning them against yourself.

189
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,490
你在要求我坑害总统
You're asking me to undermine the president.

190
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,680
好吧
All right.

191
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,660
假如总统对我的指责属实
Let's say that what the President has accused me of is true.

192
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,550
这就真的很糟吗
Would that be so bad?

193
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,480
考虑一下这么做的结果
If taken to its conclusion?

194
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,880
对你没有好处吗
Wouldn't you stand to benefit?

195
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,940
对国家没有好处吗
Wouldn't the country?

196
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,880
我不想牵扯进去
I don't want anything to do with this.

197
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,420
就再做一次  凯茜
Just one more time, Cathy.

198
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,360
别去管那些条条框框
Let's unshackle ourselves.

199
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,030
机会只有一次  冯先生
This is a one-time offer, Mr. Feng.

200
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,710
我要白纸黑字写下来  不加任何条件
I would need it in writing. Open-ended, no restrictions.

201
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,440
法定豁免权也是一样
The same goes for legal immunity.

202
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,030
首先我要确认
First I need to know whether or not

203
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,270
你是否通过拉尼根的赌场洗钱
you funneled money through Lanagin's casino.

204
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,050
不  等我安全抵达美国
No, no. I will speak freely once I've arrived safely

205
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,260
我才会全盘托出
in the United States.

206
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
除非你现在就能提供确凿证据
Unless you provide valuable evidence now,

207
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,760
司法部长不会答应任何豁免权
the attorney general will not grant immunity on any level.

208
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,640
我在中国已经全部否认了这些指控
I've denied these allegations in China.

209
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,400
我的敌人想置我于死地
My enemies want me dead.

210
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,470
你这是逼我给他们证据
You're asking me to give them confirmation.

211
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,990
作为回报  我们会给你提供避难所
And we're giving you safe haven in return.

212
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,960
我在迪拜已经有避难所了
I already have safe haven in Dubai.

213
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,120
你在那里的庇护所只是暂时的
Your asylum there is only temporary.

214
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,690
我们给你提供的是永久身份
We're offering you permanent status.

215
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,700
我相信他们也会给我永久身份
I'm confident that they will grant me permanent status.

216
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,750
是外交部长亲口跟你说的吗
Did you hear that directly from the Minister of Foreign Affairs?

217
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,710
因为我刚跟他谈过
Because I just spoke to him.

218
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,080
现在你连护照都没有
Right now you are a man without a passport.

219
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,970
北京方面还没查封的资产
Whatever assets Beijing hasn't seized

220
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,020
也都被所有和中美关系紧密的国家冻结了
are frozen in every country with close ties to the United Sates or China,

221
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,360
那基本上是全世界所有国家
which is just about every country in the world.

222
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,160
你想要自由和金钱  我们想要信息
You want your freedom and fortune. We want information.

223
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,060
冯先生
Mr. Feng?

224
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,790
你想知道什么
What do you need to know?

225
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,690
向我证实确实有洗钱行为
Confirm for me the existence of a money-laundering scheme.

226
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,700
是的  我们用赌场来掩饰外国献金
Yes. We used the casino to mask foreign contributions.

227
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,200
好的
All right.

228
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,270
你们中谁跟我讲讲这是怎么回事
One of you want to tell me what this is all about?

229
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,640
你必须得遵从
You have to comply.

230
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,240
你是说我得出席
You mean I have to show up.

231
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,210
除非我们上诉
Unless we appeal.

232
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,390
我们会输
We'd lose.

233
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,100
她要不是证据确凿
She wouldn't have issued the subpoena

234
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,040
也不会传唤我
unless she had something substantial.

235
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,750
我同意
I agree.

236
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,230
所以我觉得你该去
Which is why I think you should go

237
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,480
并拒不解释
and plead the Fifth.

238
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,770
你觉得她手上有什么
What do you think she has?

239
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,320
我不想妄加推断
I don't want to speculate.

240
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,930
老天  我付给你们六个一天的钱
God damn it, I pay the six of you more in one day

241
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,000
比供个孩子上大学都多
than it costs to put a kid through college.

242
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,870
我请你们是要你们比我知道得多
And I pay you to know more than I do.

243
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,970
她问询时说的对我们会很有帮助
Her line of questioning will tell us a lot.

244
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,340
万一她真要提出指控  我们可以据此准备辩护
We can use that to prepare our defense in case there's an indictment.

245
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,890
我什么时候走
When do I have to go?

246
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,080
你的会面是在后天
Your interview is the day after next.

247
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,270
48小时
48 hours?

248
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,250
发动不了吗
Having trouble starting it?

249
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,650
是的  可能电池没电了吧
Yeah. I think the battery might be dead.

250
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,920
如果你想试试跨接启动  我有电线
I have some cables if you want to try and jump it.

251
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,310
这真的不麻烦吗
You sure you don't mind?

252
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,600
一点也不
Not at all.

253
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,590
好吧  你真是太好了
All right. It's really nice of you.

254
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,160
开引擎盖  我把我车开过来
Pop your hood. I'll bring my car around.

255
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,300
好
Sure.

256
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,880
这位是彼得  他开车送我回来的
This is Peter. He's the guy who drove me back.

257
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,420
这些要放哪
Where do you want these?

258
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,510
我来拿  谢谢
I'll take 'em. Thanks.

259
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,700
瑞秋  是吗
Rachel, right?

260
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,500
是的
Yeah.

261
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,040
丽萨说你俩是室友
Lisa said you two were roommates.

262
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,010
要我给你拿点什么  来杯水吗
Can I get you something? A glass of water?

263
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,930
不用  谢谢  我得走了
No, thanks. I should really get going.

264
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,470
好吧  太谢谢你了
All right. I can't thank you enough.

265
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,160
不客气  希望车能修好
My pleasure. Good luck with the car.

266
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,040
谢谢
Thanks.

267
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,780
希望只是电池没电  晚安
I hope it's only a dead battery. Have a good night.

268
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,180
我们应该给他些钱
We should give him some money.

269
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,450
彼得
Peter.

270
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,700
她得离开
She needs to be gone.

271
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,140
你跟我说她可以留下的
Y-- you told me she could stay.

272
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,520
我改主意了
I changed my mind.

273
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,390
你说你不在乎她在不在这儿
But you said you didn't care if she was here --

274
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,550
我不需要解释什么
I don't need to explain myself.

275
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,870
你受不了了  是吗
You can't stand it, can you?

276
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,200
受不了我爱上了别人
The idea that I might actually love somebody.

277
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,660
受不了我生命中除了你还有别人
That I might have somebody in my life who isn't you.

278
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,370
如果你在乎她  就让她走  瑞秋
If you care about her, make it happen, Rachel.

279
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,630
没事吧
Is everything okay?

280
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,990
没事  告诉你朋友我不会要钱的
Yeah. You need to tell your friend that I won't take any money.

281
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,260
我很乐意帮忙
I was happy to do it.

282
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,410
我们都需要好心人帮忙
We all need a good Samaritan every now and again.

283
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,350
麦金尼斯将军被判处
Did you feel justice was served

284
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,950
四十年有期徒刑时  你觉得正义得到伸张了吗
when General McGinnis got sentenced to 40 years?

285
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,630
就他的罪行而言  正义是得以伸张了
Yes, as far as his crimes go.

286
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,050
但还有成千的服役士兵没有...
But not for thousands of servicemen and --

287
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,830
抱歉  抱歉打断你的讲话
I'm -- I'm sor-- I'm sorry to interrupt.

288
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,840
我的制作人告诉我
m-- my producer is telling me that,

289
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,820
杰奎琳·夏普刚打电话来
Jacqueline Sharp has called in,

290
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,230
众议院多数党党鞭  议员女士  你在吗
the house majority whip. C-- congresswoman, are you there?

291
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,880
是的  我在  克里斯  谢谢你接我的电话
Yes, I'm here, Chris. And thank you for taking my call.

292
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,320
谢谢你
Thank you.

293
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,570
你好  梅根
Hello, Megan.

294
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,020
议员女士
Congresswoman.

295
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,690
首先  作为一名老兵
First of all, as a veteran like yourself,

296
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,340
我想感谢你对国家的贡献
I want to thank you for your service to our country.

297
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,110
这是责任  无需感谢
Duty doesn't require thanks.

298
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,890
我很高兴你提到责任这个话题
I'm glad you brought up duty,

299
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,680
因为你最近将它称之为洗脑
because you recently equated it with brainwashing.

300
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,870
那不是我的本意
That's not what I meant.

301
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,350
你说"紧跟党派路线"
You said "Toeing the party line."

302
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,230
我的本意是文化和体系是...
What I meant was that the culture and the system is one that --

303
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,020
我不是打电话来和你辩论的  梅根  恰恰相反
I didn't call to argue with you, Megan. The opposite.

304
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,640
我们要解决这个问题  就必须找到共同点
We can't fix this problem until we find some common ground.

305
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,520
你不觉得吗
Wouldn't you agree?

306
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,560
就我来看这个问题没有妥协空间
There is no middle ground as far as I'm concerned.

307
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,280
军队需要改变
The military needs to change --

308
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,380
你和我都曾经在军中服役
Can't we agree that you and I served

309
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,750
以保护人民自由辩论的权利
so that we could protect open debate,

310
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,070
而这正是民主的基础  你说不是吗
which is the very bedrock of democracy?

311
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,280
理论上是的  但这不是我要说的
Yes, in theory, but that's not what I'm talking about.

312
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,330
不是理论上  是实际上
Not in theory. In reality.

313
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,280
勇敢的人为了这份自由不惜牺牲生命
Brave men and women die fighting for that freedom.

314
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,690
勇敢的涵义就是为那些和你意见相左的人
The meaning of bravery is fighting for the freedom

315
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,710
也同样享有自由而战斗
of those with whom you disagree.

316
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,350
当然  但我们回到真正的话题上来好吗
Sure, but let's get back to the issue here.

317
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,630
我认为不勇敢的人是克莱尔·安德伍德
What I don't think is brave is Claire Underwood

318
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,180
逃避这场辩论  找你替她进行这场斗争
dodging this debate and having you fight this battle for her instead.

319
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,360
不是这样的
That's not true.

320
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,160
那我为什么在和你而不是她谈话  这是她的法案
Then why am I talking to you instead of her? It's her bill.

321
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,960
不只是她  是我们共同的成果
It's not just hers. It's all of ours.

322
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,790
可是你勇敢地说出来了
Except one of you is brave enough to say it,

323
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,690
而她却是个懦夫
and the other is a coward.

324
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,490
安德伍德夫人勇敢地
Mrs. Underwood was brave enough

325
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,740
在全国电视节目上承认她...
to go on national television and admit that she --

326
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,440
没错  但那之后她去哪了
Yeah, and where has she been since then?

327
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,170
应付丑闻  躲避媒体
Deflecting scandal and hiding from the press.

328
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,520
梅根  你在《纽约时代杂志》上说我可耻
You called me disgraceful in The New York Times, Megan,

329
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,160
你当然有这个权利
and you have every right.

330
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,960
但我也有权说  安德伍德夫人是可耻的
But I also have the right to say that Mrs. Underwood is disgraceful,

331
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,410
因为没有什么
because there is nothing

332
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,400
比当逃兵更可耻
more disgraceful than running from a battle.

333
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,430
-梅根  -我们根本没有...
- Megan? - That is -- we're not even...

334
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,940
我们马上回来
We'll be right back.

335
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,470
你要去哪
Where are you going?

336
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
去国会
To the Capitol.

337
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,630
冯提到我或总统了吗
Did Feng mention either me or the president?

338
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,660
邓巴不肯说
Dunbar wouldn't say.

339
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,180
但冯确认了洗钱行为
But the fact that Feng confirmed the money laundering

340
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,020
这足以让白宫更受关注
increases focus on the White House.

341
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,230
反正我们是清白的
Well, as long as we're innocent, which we are.

342
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,790
雷蒙德·塔斯克被传唤了
Raymond Tusk has been subpoenaed.

343
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,810
你为什么找我们见面  比尔
Why did you ask for this meeting, Bill?

344
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,180
就为了向我们通报消息吗
Just keeping us in the loop?

345
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,310
是你让国务卿杜兰特给予冯政治庇护吗
Did you encourage Secretary Durant to offer Feng asylum?

346
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,980
比尔  我的天呐
Bill, for god sakes.

347
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,220
总统也可能问我这个问题
The president could have asked me that question himself.

348
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,960
作为白宫顾问  这是我的责任
As the White House counsel, it is my responsibility --

349
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,730
不  我没有
No, I did not.

350
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,970
那么这是杜兰特自己的主意喽
So you're saying Durant acted of her own accord.

351
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,910
我不知道她的动机是什么
I have no idea what her motivations were.

352
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,290
我和总统一样感到震惊
I'm just as shocked as the president

353
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,070
她居然没经过他本人允许就擅自而为了
that she would have gone through with this without his direct approval.

354
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,120
还有一个问题我想和你谈谈
There's another matter I'd like to discuss.

355
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,190
如果可以  最好只跟你谈
Privately, if we could.

356
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,870
让我们单独待会儿
Just give us a few moments.

357
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,570
-咨询  -是的
- The therapy.- Yes.

358
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,630
具体说  就是放弃保密权
To be specific, the confidentiality waiver.

359
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,460
冯的证词把我们推到一个非常尴尬的位置上
Feng's testimony puts us in a very awkward position.

360
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,130
我们现在面对放弃保密权的极大压力
We're under a great deal of pressure to waive the privilege.

361
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,050
如果不放弃  就相当于总统
If we don't, it implies that the president

362
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,700
承认了他没做过的事
may have confessed to things he didn't.

363
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,300
邓巴只是在瞎猜  别让步
Dunbar is just grasping. Don't give in.

364
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,710
我不想让步
I don't want to.

365
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,400
但拉金宗教指导保密协议的说法并不可靠
But Larkin's argument for spiritual confidentiality is shaky at best.

366
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,750
我们想控制事态的发展
We want to control how this thing plays out.

367
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,330
我能帮什么忙
How can I help?

368
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,230
我们要确保不会再节外生枝
We need to know if anyone else might pop out of the woodwork.

369
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,710
我没对任何人说过  克莱尔也没说过
Well, I haven't mentioned it to anyone, and neither has Claire.

370
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,470
我不会辜负总统对我的信任
I would never betray the president's trust like that.

371
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,670
谢谢你抽出时间
Thank you for your time.

372
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,240
告诉总统  我非常难过
Tell the president it saddens me that

373
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,550
我们现在只能通过律师交流
we now have to communicate through lawyers.

374
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,250
要是他想亲自和我谈谈
I will make myself available if he wants

375
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,270
我会抽出时间的
to discuss any of this in person.

376
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,030
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

377
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,610
梅根的话太过分了
What Megan said was offensive.

378
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,060
她不该质疑你的品行
She shouldn't have questioned your character.

379
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,960
那都是精心准备的谈话要点  而且不是她准备的
Those were talking points. Carefully crafted, and not by her.

380
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,240
我不是来挑衅的  杰姬  我是来解决问题的 
I'm not here to pick a fight, Jackie. I'm here to end one.

381
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,870
只要法案进行投票  这事就会结束
Well, it'll end soon enough when the bill goes to the floor.

382
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,500
不会进行投票的
It won't go to the floor.

383
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,560
我跟艾琳·布鲁克斯谈过了  我要撤销法案
I've spoken to Elaine Brooks and I'm withdrawing the bill.

384
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,990
你说的有一定道理
What you said had some truth.

385
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,840
之前你提出
And early on you offered

386
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,380
我们一起找个折中的办法
to sit down with me and find a middle ground.

387
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,850
我那时拒绝了你
I decided to draw a line in the sand.

388
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,680
但勇敢的做法应该是
And the braver thing would've been for me

389
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,850
收起我的骄傲  跟你好好谈
to swallow my pride and sit down with you.

390
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,550
如果你还愿谈  我想重新开始
If you're still open to that, I'd love to start over.

391
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,640
你和弗兰克在打什么主意吗
Are you and Frank up to something?

392
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,330
一项能通过的法案
A passable bill.

393
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,330
他让南茜监视我  他把我的个人生活搞得
He had Nancy spy on me. He brought my personal life into --

394
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,480
弗兰西斯习惯了事事得逞
Francis is used to getting his way.

395
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,130
他会不惜一切确保成功
And he'll do anything to make sure he does,

396
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,780
尤其是对我重要的事
especially if it's something important to me.

397
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,850
我不知道  克莱尔  我很怀疑
I don't know, Claire. I'm skeptical.

398
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,280
之前那样对待你  我们深表歉意
We're deeply sorry for the way we've treated you

399
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,370
我们想重拾失去的信任
and we want to rebuild the trust we've lost.

400
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,210
你觉得这可能吗
Do you think that's possible?

401
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,600
很抱歉突然这么来了  我打过电话
I'm sorry to ambush you. I tried calling.

402
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,180
你不能这么对我  克莱尔
You can't do this to me, Claire.

403
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,740
我说得很清楚  我必须尊重加勒特的意愿
I was very clear that I have to respect Garrett's wishes --

404
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,660
不是那个  是性侵法案
Not that. The sexual assault bill.

405
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,530
不会进行投票了
It's not going to a vote.

406
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,510
议长从日程中删除了吗
Did the speaker remove it from the docket?

407
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,290
不  是我撤掉了  我刚跟杰姬谈过
No. I did. I just spoke to Jackie.

408
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,800
是因为她那样说你吗
This is because of what she said about you?

409
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,660
我主要是担心她接下来会不会对付你
My main concern is that she doesn't come after you next.

410
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,510
你和加勒特接受调查期间绝不能发生这种事
Not while you and Garrett are going through the investigation.

411
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,350
我想来告诉你
I thought you should be aware

412
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,070
因为我知道这项法案对你有多重要
because I know how much this bill meant to you.

413
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,760
你为法案投入了那么多
All the work you've put in.

414
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
我们都投入过
That we've put in.

415
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,580
但我们要通过杰姬的法案
But we'll pass Jackie's version,

416
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,980
迈出这一小步  循序渐进
take this baby step, and build on it.

417
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,270
法案的事我很失望  
I'm disappointed about the bill,

418
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,920
但不得不说  我松了口气
but I have to say, I'm relieved.

419
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,950
你还好吧
How are you holding up?

420
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,830
你听说凯瑟琳做了什么吗  许诺冯政治避难
Did you hear what Catherine did? Giving Feng asylum?

421
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,770
不可原谅
Inexcusable.

422
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,270
加勒特气疯了  他觉得走投无路
Garrett's beside himself. He feels cornered,

423
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,760
这下我们除了放弃保密权别无选择
like we have no choice but to waive the privileges now.

424
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,370
药物的事呢
But what about the medication?

425
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,260
可不是啊
I know.

426
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,590
我不该说的
I shouldn't be sharing this.

427
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,160
不说了  你该走了
We don't have to talk about it. You should go.

428
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,850
我知道你日程排得很满
I know you have a packed schedule.

429
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,030
谢谢你这么做
Thank you for doing this.

430
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,480
我只是在走廊里单独找上了她
All I had to do was get her alone in a hallway.

431
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,000
我是说杰姬那边
I meant with Jackie.

432
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,790
我们要分清轻重缓急
We have our priorities.

433
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,960
我知道做这样的放弃并不容易
Well, I know it isn't easy to let go of something like that.

434
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,320
答应我一件事
Promise me something.

435
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,520
你说吧
Anything.

436
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,670
我不能一个人住在这房子里
I can't live in this house alone.

437
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,860
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

438
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,280
你是这么说  但这事可能事与愿违
You say that, but this could all backfire.

439
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,910
雷蒙德肯定会拒不解释
Raymond will plead the Fifth.

440
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,870
如果他提到我  便是承认有罪了
If he names me, it's an admission of his own wrongdoing.

441
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,470
我更担心加勒特
I'm more worried about Garrett.

442
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,230
你制造了一个有力的对手
You've made a powerful enemy.

443
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,030
我们比他们强
We're stronger than they are.

444
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,920
可他仍然是总统
And he's still the president.

445
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,670
我向你保证  你被迫做出的一切牺牲之中
I promise you, of all of the sacrifices that you've had to make,

446
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,400
绝不会包括与一名罪犯离婚
divorcing a convict will not be one of them.

447
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,600
我们不能放弃保密权  加勒特
We can't waive the privileges, Garrett.

448
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,880
我们没别的选择了  冯承认了那笔钱
Well, we don't have a choice anymore. Feng confirmed the money.

449
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,030
在电话上承认的  不是当面正式承认的
Over the phone. Not in a formal interview.

450
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,340
解除对他的庇护  送他回去
Rescind the asylum. Send him back --

451
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,880
妨碍司法公正
Obstruction of justice.

452
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,170
嘉利克这么说的吗
Is that what Galich said?

453
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,610
别人肯定会这么想
Definitely how it would be perceived.

454
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,880
我们任何不配合调查的举动
And anything we do that looks like a failure to cooperate

455
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,340
都会加重他们的猜疑
amplifies that perception.

456
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,680
我只是不想公开我们的婚姻问题
I just don't want our marriage put on display.

457
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,590
邓巴会问我是否提及过中国  我没有
Look, Dunbar'll ask if I brought up China. I didn't.

458
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,780
拉金能证明我的清白
So Larkin can only help to exonerate me.

459
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,590
如果婚姻咨询最终进入报告  也无所谓
And if the marriage counseling ends up in the report, so be it.

460
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,690
我们能渡过这个难关
We can survive that.

461
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,290
但他给我们开了处方药
But he prescribed us medication.

462
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,780
不算是我们
Technically not us.

463
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,260
你在吃我的药  加勒特
You took mine, Garrett.

464
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,500
拉金知道你会吃才给我开的药
Larkin wrote the prescription to me knowing you would.

465
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,300
等等  你提过了  处方药的事
Wait, wait, have you mentioned it? The medication?

466
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,100
跟克莱尔吗
Claire?

467
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,540
对不起  我只能跟她倾诉
I'm sorry. But she's the only person I can talk to

468
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,990
只有她能理解
who really understands what it's like --

469
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,850
那我们更要放弃保密权了
Oh, all the more reason we have to waive the privilege.

470
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,670
如果他们泄露出去  就由不得我们做主了
If they leak this, we can't control the information.

471
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,040
克莱尔不会那么做的
Claire wouldn't do that.

472
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,420
不要小看她
Don't underestimate her.

473
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,080
他们要是真准备这么做  现在不早做了
If they were going to, don't you think they would have done it by now?

474
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,240
她为了减少我们的负担  放弃了性侵法案
She dropped the sexual assault bill to reduce pressure on us.

475
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,700
她也许是这么跟你说的
That may have been what she told you.

476
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,940
他们什么都不会说的
They're not going to say anything.

477
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,130
我求你了  加勒特
I'm begging you, Garrett.

478
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,210
不要放弃保密权
Don't waive the privilege.

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,070
我们谈论的事太私密了
The things we talked about were so intimate.

480
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,150
如果孩子们看到
Imagine if the kids --

481
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,300
我知道  但是特莉莎
I know. But Tricia --

482
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,250
我们竞选的时候
When we ran,

483
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,940
我知道我们的生活将被人仔细审视
I knew every aspect of our lives would be under scrutiny.

484
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,580
但我觉得我们至少还能保护这个
But I thought we could protect at least this.

485
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,100
发生在家里的事
What happens in here.

486
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,480
我会不惜一切保护我们
I'll protect us. Whatever I have to do.

487
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,620
你要相信我
You have to believe that.

488
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,750
我们检查了USB软件狗
We checked the USB dongle.

489
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,150
你声称感染了信息中心的代码不在里面
The code you're claiming infected the data center isn't there.

490
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,950
我设计那段代码一到达服务器便自我删除
I programmed the code to self-erase as soon as it hit the server.

491
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,820
在卢卡斯被捕之前就不见了
It was gone before Lucas was in cuffs.

492
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,070
你信不过我
You don't believe me?

493
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,460
这可是世上最复杂的防火墙之一
This is one of the most sophisticated firewalls in the world.

494
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,950
就算真的进去了  也破坏不了
Even if your code did get in there, you couldn't break it down.

495
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,790
你妻子手机的运营商就是他们公司
Your wife uses AT&T.

496
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,270
她情人也是
So does her lover.

497
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,520
什么
What?

498
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,730
她现在就在那儿  乔纳森·坎普
She's over there right now. Jonathan Kemp.

499
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,630
她的脊椎按摩师  对吗
It's her chiropractor, right?

500
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,170
想看看他们互发的短信吗
Want to see their texts to each other?

501
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,830
不想
No.

502
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,610
看来你早就知道了
Oh, I see you already know.

503
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,570
我理解你不想把事情闹大
I don't blame you for not making a fuss,

504
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,100
毕竟孩子们还在家里
what with the kids still at home.

505
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,420
但你让我的代码进了那扇门
But you walked my code right through that door.

506
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,660
进入了三千两百万人的手机里
Into 32 million people's phones.

507
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,950
这都怪你
And that's on you.

508
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,220
联调局也罪责难逃  这会闹得很难看
And it's on the FBI. And it is a shit-storm

509
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,180
让联调局面临国会的调查
that will bring the Bureau right in front of Congress.

510
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,390
所以你告诉我  平息这一切要多大代价
So you tell me: How much is making that disappear worth?

511
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,680
你面临一百年的监禁
You have a hundred years hanging over your head.

512
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,480
敲诈联调局对你没好处
Extorting the FBI won't help you.

513
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,470
是道格拉斯·斯坦普让你陷害卢卡斯·古德温的吗
Did Douglas Stamper tell you to set up Lucas Goodwin?

514
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,660
反恐主管
Counter-Terrorism Director.

515
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,250
跟白宫联络官相比真是一步登天
That's a big step up from White House Liaison.

516
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,470
-我认为你背后有推手  -胡说
- I think you had a helping hand. - Not true.

517
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,780
继续编  但以下是我的要求
Keep lying. Meanwhile, here's what I want.

518
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,080
第一  我不再是你的走狗了
One, I'm no longer your bitch.

519
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,260
第二  撤销对我的所有指控
Two, all of my charges are dropped.

520
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,440
第三  撤销所有对巴利特·布朗的指控
Three, all of Barrett Brown's charges are dropped.

521
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,670
这得看联邦检察官的
That's up to the U.S. Attorney.

522
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,440
你去想办法
Figure it out.

523
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,160
如果我没理解错
If I'm hearing you correctly,

524
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,430
您是想要拉金的证词侧重在洗钱上
you'd like to keep Larkin's testimony focused on the money laundering.

525
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,000
而我从来没提过  因为我毫不知情
Which I never brought up, because I knew nothing about it.

526
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,410
但您担心其他的事  私人的事
But your concern is other matters. Private matters.

527
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,090
这些和调查无关
Which are irrelevant to the investigation.

528
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,370
我不能阻止邓巴问问题
I can't prevent Dunbar from asking what she's gonna ask.

529
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,440
当然不能
Of course not.

530
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,210
我最多只能去拜托拉金医生
The most I can do is ask Dr. Larkin

531
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,620
跟他对下部分问题的回答
how he would respond to certain questions.

532
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,660
但他很聪明  会明白我的目的
But he's a smart man. He'll understand what I'm getting at.

533
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,410
这路子合法吗
And this approach keeps us within the law?

534
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,110
没有干扰证词吗
We're not tampering with testimony?

535
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,430
界线很模糊  但我会确保合法
It's a fine line. But I'll stay on the right side of it.

536
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,360
他不见我  弗兰克  就像他对你一样
He shut me out, Frank. Just like he did with you.

537
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,080
我的副国务卿被委派了全权外交权
My undersecretary has been assigned full diplomatic authority.

538
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,030
暂时的挫折  凯茜  我到哪你到哪
A temporary setback, Cathy. Where I go, you go.

539
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,420
现在总统正在战况室
At this very moment, the President is in the Situation Room.

540
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,310
中方对冯的政治庇护的反应跟我预想的一样
China responded to Feng's asylum exactly the way I predicted.

541
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,120
他们增派了一倍海军前往与那国岛
They're doubling their naval presence off the coast of Yonaguni.

542
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,250
你猜谁被赶出战况室了  你和我  弗兰克
And you know who isn't in the Situation Room? You and I, Frank.

543
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,030
你只盯着眼下一时的得失
You're thinking about where we are

544
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,580
却对情势的发展方向视而不见
instead of where we're headed.

545
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,490
这可不像那个在杰斐逊舞会上
Now that isn't the Catherine Durant

546
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,110
和我共舞华尔兹的凯瑟琳·杜兰特
that I waltzed with at the Jefferson Ball.

547
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,110
她深明大势所趋
She understood potential.

548
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,240
她盯着未来
She had her eyes toward the future.

549
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,650
我对那个凯瑟琳·杜兰特说
I told that Catherine Durant

550
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,210
我们需要她这样的人领导国务院
that we needed her in the State Department.

551
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,370
现在也是如此  真不知她哪去了
We still need her. I wish I knew where she was,

552
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,360
因为她和我眼前这个凯瑟琳·杜兰特
because she is not the Catherine Durant

553
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,350
完全是两种人
sitting in front of me right now.

554
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,140
但我跟你说
But I'll tell you something,

555
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,400
如果她不赶快回来的话
If she doesn't show up soon, well,

556
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,670
那这支华尔兹  我只好独自舞下去了
I'm just gonna have to keep waltzing alone.

557
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,010
因为我已经不想再去说服我面前的这个女人
Because I am done trying to convince this woman in front of me

558
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,950
和我携手前行了
to take my arm.

559
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,230
你快忙去吧  我不留你了
Oh, don't let me keep you.

560
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,390
我就在这儿  我哪也不去  弗兰克
I'm here. I'm not going anywhere, Frank.

561
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,340
你现在能拿到总统简报吗
You still have access to the presidential briefing?

562
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,050
能  就在我手上
Yes, I have it right here.

563
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,800
跟我说说与中国之间的全部情况
Walk me through everything that's going on with China.

564
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,300
冯也出场了  也许我们用得上他
Feng is in play now. We might be able to use him.

565
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,530
怎么用
How?

566
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,980
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

567
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,550
但显然他在北京眼里是有价值的
But he's clearly valuable to Beijing,

568
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,600
那么他对我们就也有价值
which makes him valuable to us.

569
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,870
从没提起过冯山德吗
Nothing about Xander Feng?

570
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:00,950
没有
Never.

571
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,730
丹尼尔·拉尼根呢  还有雷蒙德·塔斯克
Daniel Lanagin? Raymond Tusk?

572
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,590
我们只谈了他的婚姻
We only discussed their marriage.

573
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,110
从未涉及白宫的公务
Nothing about the business of the White House.

574
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,350
他可曾间接提起过与工作有关的压力
Any oblique reference to work-related pressures he was feeling?

575
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,950
他说他现在睡眠太少
He said he wasn't getting as much sleep as he'd like.

576
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,590
你给他开过什么药物吗
Did you ever prescribe him any medication?

577
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,010
正如我一贯声称  我只提供宗教咨询
As I've always stated, I provided religious counsel.

578
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,530
我明白  但我问的是药物处方
I understand. But I'm asking about medication.

579
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,050
这有什么关系吗
How is this relevant?

580
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,200
我想查证他的判断力是否因此受影响
I'm trying to assess whether his judgment may have been impaired.

581
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,200
在我看来  他和他的妻子
In my opinion, he and his wife were

582
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,420
面对的是典型的婚姻问题
dealing with standard marital issues.

583
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,970
你这是答非所问  拉金医生
That's not what I asked, Dr. Larkin.

584
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,390
所以我再问第三遍
So I will ask for a third time.

585
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,430
而且问得更明确些
And let me be more specific.

586
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,570
美利坚合众国总统在接受你的咨询服务时
Was any medication prescribed or taken as a result of your

587
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,110
你是否提供过任何形式的处方或者药物
counseling session by the President of the United States?

588
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,270
他的工作能力完全没有受影响
His faculties were operating at a hundred percent,

589
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,760
如果你是想问这个的话
if that's what you're asking.

590
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,240
是不是有政府方面的人和你谈过了
Has anyone from the administration spoken to you?

591
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,880
什么意思
How do you mean?

592
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,910
关于取证  是不是有人找过你  指导过你
About this deposition. Has anyone approached you, coached you?

593
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,310
如果你现在承认  我会将此认定为及时申报
If you tell me now, I will qualify that as a timely declaration.

594
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,080
-我不想继续了  -总统放弃了他的保密权利
- I'd like to leave. - The President waived his privilege.

595
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,340
但我是自愿作证的
But I'm here voluntarily.

596
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,650
拉金医生  一开始你不肯作证
Dr. Larkin, at first you wouldn't talk to me

597
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,180
因为那有违你的道德准则
because it violated your ethical code.

598
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,650
我尊重你的选择
I respect that.

599
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,230
但现在我要问你  作为一个虔诚之人
But let me ask you, as a man of faith

600
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,150
蓄意对我说谎  难道就不违反你的道德准则吗
is deliberately lying to me an exception to that code?

601
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,640
因为你拒绝说出实情的话  就是作伪证
Because that is what you're doing by refusing to share the truth.

602
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,650
我不明白
I don't understand.

603
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,550
这法案过不了的
It wasn't going to pass.

604
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,740
但你说我们就要争取到足够的支持了
But you said we almost had the votes.

605
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,720
我们需要能完全确定  但实情并非如此
We needed to be a hundred percent solid, and we weren't.

606
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,300
如果法案未能通过  我们的努力就白费了
If the bill failed, that would set us back.

607
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,300
我们必须接受渐进的改革方案
We need to accept incremental reform.

608
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,500
你的口气跟杰姬·夏普一模一样
You sound just like Jackie Sharp.

609
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,220
其实我现在与她合作了
I'm actually working with her now.

610
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,950
她是一个有力的盟友
She's a powerful ally for us to have.

611
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,780
可她那样让我下不来台
After what she did to me?

612
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,550
还公开羞辱你
After what she said about you?

613
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,720
我要是被他人的非议所左右
If I let the things people say about me get under my skin,

614
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,670
我连家门都出不去了
I wouldn't be able to leave my own home.

615
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,760
你知道结果会怎样
You know how this will go.

616
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,810
人人都会说"太好了  我们取得了成功"
Everyone will say, "Great, we did something,"

617
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,300
但其实一无所成
Which is really nothing.

618
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,900
他们会高兴一时  然后就抛诸脑后忘个干净
They'll pat themselves on the back and they'll forget about it.

619
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,100
我们让人们注意这个话题了
We helped put this on the radar.

620
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,310
我以为我们是要真正改变现状
I thought we were doing something real.

621
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,910
改变人们的生活  幼稚死了  对吧
Changing people's lives. How naive, right?

622
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,920
但至少我不愿意放弃
But at least I didn't want to give up.

623
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,780
也许杰姬·夏普说对了
Maybe Jackie Sharp is right.

624
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,800
你他妈就是个懦夫
You are a fucking coward.

625
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,640
是我鼓励你站出来说出你的遭遇
I'm the one that pulled you out from under the covers.

626
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,360
之前你在逃避  靠吃药度日
You were hiding. You and your pills.

627
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,610
编造各种谎言自欺欺人
So you tell yourself whatever you need to.

628
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,530
我失态了
I'm sorry.

629
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,530
有些政治现实是我们无法忽视的
There were political realities we couldn't ignore.

630
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,000
你想没想过为什么那么多人憎恨华盛顿
Do you ever wonder why so many people hate Washington?

631
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,100
就是因为你这种人说那种屁话
It's because of people like you using phrases like that.

632
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,990
雷蒙德
Raymond?

633
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,320
虽说该开灯  但既然花钱住进
I'd turn the lights on, but when you're paying for the room

634
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,800
风景最好的房间  就不如欣赏个够
with the best view you might as well make the most of it.

635
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,830
我从来没上过顶层  你呢
I've never been in the penthouse here. Have you?

636
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,490
这是什么情况
What's going on?

637
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,550
你知道我为什么来华盛顿吗
Do you know why I'm in D.C.?

638
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,910
没关系  雷米
Oh, it's okay, Remy.

639
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,330
你能说出的话我都已经知道了
There's nothing you can say that I don't already know.

640
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,530
冯要去作证了
Feng is on his way to testify.

641
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,070
不管赛斯跟你说了什么都不要信他
Whatever Seth has told you, don't believe a word of it.

642
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,600
他会说什么我不该相信的事呢
What might he have told me that I shouldn't believe?

643
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,750
你跟副总统见面了
You met with the Vice President.

644
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,220
在一座教堂里  别装作没这回事
In a church. Don't pretend you didn't.

645
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,520
想当两面派吗
Playing both sides?

646
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,150
雷蒙德  我...
Raymond, look --

647
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,400
我想听你说出来  你跟弗兰克见面了
I want to hear you say it. That you met with Frank.

648
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,180
我会跟你说的  雷蒙德  但他不能在这儿
I'll talk to you, Raymond, but not with him here.

649
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,260
你先出去吧
Leave us.

650
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,440
要我在电梯里等你吗
Should I hold the elevator for you?

651
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,830
滚你妈的
Go fuck yourself.

652
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,980
好  那你走楼梯吧
Okay. You can take the stairs.

653
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,390
他们在耍你  雷蒙德
They're toying with you, Raymond.

654
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,730
没错  但是你也一样  雷米
No doubt. But so are you, Remy.

655
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,660
我是想哄骗弗兰克  让他以为已经安全了
I wanted to lead Frank on, give him a false sense of security.

656
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,870
如果你要说谎  那就说得漂亮点
If you're gonna lie, lie better than that.

657
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,440
他们想离间我们
They want to tear us apart.

658
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,670
你想要多条退路  这我不怪你
I don't blame you for wanting to keep your options open.

659
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,500
但你显然买错了保险
But clearly you have bought the wrong insurance policy.

660
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,600
不要这样搬起石头砸自己的脚
Don't shoot yourself in the foot like this.

661
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,100
你的脚  石头也是你拿着呢
Your foot. And you're holding the gun.

662
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,580
去找个别的地方流血吧
Now go someplace else to bleed.

663
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,890
你想谈谈流血吗
You want to talk about blood?

664
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,490
你与弗兰克的这场战争已经让你流了多少血了
How much have you spilt in this war with Frank?

665
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,560
我做的一切都是为了维护和平
All I've tried to do is keep the peace.

666
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,050
你本可让他占上风
You could've let him have the upper hand.

667
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,600
除了你的自尊  还会让你损失什么
What would that have really cost you, other than your pride?

668
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,030
真遗憾
Such a shame.

669
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,230
你刚刚树立了身家420亿的敌人  雷米
You have just made 42 billion enemies, Remy.

670
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,530
外加一些零头
And some change.

671
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,080
390亿  雷蒙德
39 billion, Raymond.

672
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,930
你的市值在缩水
Your market cap is shrinking.

673
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,430
白宫顾问比尔·嘉利克今早被特别检察官
White House Counsel Bill Galich was called into questioning this morning

674
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,790
希瑟·邓巴传唤质询
by Special Prosecutor Heather Dunbar.

675
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,470
从邓巴办公室得到的消息称
According to Dunbar's office,

676
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,130
他们怀疑
there are suspicions that

677
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,000
嘉利克可能干预了证人的证词
Galich may have tampered with witness testimony.

678
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,780
这名证人是托马斯·拉金医生
The witness in question is Dr. Thomas Larkin,

679
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,180
一位牧师与咨询师
a reverend and therapist

680
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,100
据称他为总统和第一夫人进行了
who allegedly conducted secret marriage counseling sessions

681
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,230
秘密婚姻咨询
for the president and first lady.

682
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,970
如果没有来自总统的明确指示
The White House counsel wouldn't be manipulating testimony

683
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,210
白宫顾问是不会去干预证词的
without explicit direction from the Oval Office.

684
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,890
同样让人不安的是
And just as disconcerting is the fact that

685
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,990
我们的总统在寻求心理治疗
our president is seeking psychological treatment

686
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,970
并且向美国人民隐瞒这一点
and chose to hide this from the American people.

687
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,110
如果在这方面我们无法信任他
If we can't trust him about that,

688
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,190
那我们又怎么知道他是否与洗钱阴谋有关呢
then how do we know he wasn't involved in a money-laundering scheme?

689
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,460
怎么知道他的精神状况适合来领导我们呢
How do we know he's mentally fit to lead?

690
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,580
最重要的是
And most important,

691
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,870
如果他知法犯法又如何维护法律
how can he enforce the law when he's breaking it?

692
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,380
我认为我们众议院的同事
I believe our colleagues in the House

693
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,530
已经有足够理由考虑弹劾
certainly have enough to consider Articles of Impeachment.

694
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,250
信任与法律都被践踏
Both trust and laws have been broken.

695
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,990
不管众议院作何打算
Whatever the House decides to do,

696
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,550
总统必须承担责任
we must hold this president accountable.

697
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,430
全力支持总统
Fully support the president

698
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,440
不管发生什么都跟他站在一起
and will stand by him no matter what comes his way.

699
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,290
揽进来  处理掉  给我找艾拉·萨伊德
Put that in, put it out. Then get me Ayla Sayyad.

700
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,700
至于雷米  让他再多倒霉一阵子吧
And as for Remy, let's let him wither on the vine a little longer.

701
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,540
同时  让他的另一半明天来众议院
In the meantime, have his better half come by the house tomorrow.

702
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,520
雷蒙德
Raymond?

703
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,810
不  杰姬
No. Jackie.

704
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,690
塔斯克先生
Mr. Tusk.

705
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,620
邓巴女士  我活了67年
Well, Ms. Dunbar, in 67 years on this planet

706
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,370
还从来没被传唤过
I have never once been issued a subpoena.

707
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,090
现在总算可以从遗愿清单上划掉了
I can now cross that off my bucket list.

708
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,330
此次会面将被记录和封存
This interview is being recorded and sealed.

709
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,520
如传票所述  塔斯克先生  我与冯山德谈过了
As the subpoena mentioned, Mr. Tusk, I spoke with Xander Feng.

710
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,270
他指证你与他合作  自2005年以来
He verified that you were his partner

711
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,640
将中国资金洗白并流入超级政治行动委员会
in laundering Chinese money to political Super PACs since 2005.

712
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,110
你如何回应他的指控
How would you respond to his allegations?

713
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,640
我的客户要行使宪法第五修正案赋予的权利
My client exercises his right to plead the Fifth Amendment.

714
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,350
你是否曾用这些捐赠来换取政治利益
Did you ever use these contributions to bargain for political favors?

715
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,590
我的客户要行使宪法第五修正案赋予的权利
My client exercises his right to plead the Fifth Amendment.

716
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,770
你跟丹尼尔·拉尼根是什么关系
What was your relationship with Daniel Lanagin?

717
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,250
我的客户要行使宪法第五修正案赋予的权利
My client exercises his right to plead the Fifth Amendment.

718
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,100
我都记不得我为什么要来这儿了
I don't even remember why I came over here.

719
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,100
你是说你最初来我家吗
You mean when you first showed up?

720
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,560
不  我是说来厨房
No. To the kitchen.

721
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,830
很抱歉  别认为我不爱你
I'm sorry. Please don't think that I don't love you --

722
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,650
那是为什么  我不明白
Then why? I don't get it.

723
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,120
一切发展得太快了
Everything's been so fast.

724
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:58,970
还有
And...

725
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,020
我不知道  很难说清  但我还没准备好
I don't know. It's hard to explain, but I'm not ready for this.

726
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,910
-都是胡说  -不是的
- That's bullshit. - No, it's not.

727
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,640
我还在努力适应新生活
I'm still trying to figure out this new life.

728
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,180
这一切太让人搞不清
And this is too confusing.

729
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,990
只有这是清清楚楚的  这你知道
This is the only thing that's clear, and you know it.

730
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,480
你在害怕  但这是好事
You're afraid, but it's good to be afraid when you're--

731
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,770
你得离开  为了你自己好
I need you to leave, okay? For your own good.

732
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,690
我只会伤害你
I am just gonna hurt you.

733
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,300
我比你想得坚强得多
I have thicker skin than you can even imagine.

734
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,470
别把事情搞得太痛苦
Please don't make this harder than it has to be.

735
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,480
昨天一切都还好好的  这么突然
Everything was fine yesterday. It's so sudden.

736
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,760
简直莫名其妙
It's like it's coming out of nowhere.

737
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,990
不是这样  我已经考虑了一段时间了
Well, it's not. I've been thinking about it for a while.

738
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,630
你没有  否则我会察觉的
No, you haven't. I would have sensed it.

739
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,700
求你  拜托你  走就是了
Would you please, please, please just go?

740
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,910
告诉我发生了什么事
Just tell me what's going on.

741
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,030
我不指望你会理解
I don't expect you to understand.

742
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,930
也许你可以试着...
Well, maybe if you try --

743
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,120
我不想让你待在这儿  好吗
I don't want you here. Okay?

744
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,360
我不像你爱我那样爱着你
I don't love you the way that you love me.

745
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,060
只是利用你  因为有你陪着感觉很好
I was using you because it felt good to have you around,

746
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,570
但那样很自私
but it was selfish.

747
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,930
我说那些话  因为我知道你爱听
I said the words because I knew you wanted to hear 'em,

748
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,720
但我不是真心的
but I didn't mean 'em.

749
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,470
我不想继续说下去了
And I don't want to keep saying 'em.

750
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,170
我出去走一会儿  你收拾东西吧
I'm gonna go for a walk while you pack your stuff.

751
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,360
不  我不要这儿的任何东西
No. I don't want anything that's been here.

752
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,880
丽萨
Lisa...?

753
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,210
四面的山洼雾气氤氲
"There was a steaming mist in all the hollows,

754
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,670
凄凉地往山顶涌动
and it roamed in its forlornness up the hill,

755
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,220
仿佛是个邪恶的精灵  寻找歇脚之地而不得
like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.

756
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,190
那雾粘乎乎的  冰寒彻骨
A clammy, and intensely cold mist,

757
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,350
缓缓地在空中波浪式地翻滚
it made it its slow way through the air in ripples

758
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,890
一浪一浪清晰可见  然后宛如污浊的海涛
that visibly followed and overspread one another,

759
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,950
彼此渗诱  融合成了一片
as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.

760
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,640
雾很浓  车灯几乎
It was dense enough to shut out everything

761
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,910
什么也照不见
from the light of the coach lamps."

762
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,770
很惊讶你想和我聊聊
I'm surprised you wanted to speak to me.

763
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,870
我并不是很受政府欢迎
I haven't been the biggest friend of the administration.

764
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,370
这难道不是找你谈话的最佳理由吗
Isn't that the very best reason to speak with you?

765
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,980
我想开始录音
I'd like to begin recording.

766
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,330
请便
By all means.

767
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,980
许多政治分析家预测
A number of political analysts predict

768
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,350
众议院司法委员会
that the House Judiciary Committee

769
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,760
将就弹劾状开始听证会
will commence with hearings on Articles of Impeachment.

770
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,280
先就此打住
Let's just stop right there.

771
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,110
你说的这些分析家
So these analysts you speak of,

772
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:23,130
他们在邓巴的报告发表前就做出预测
they're making predictions prior to Dunbar's report even being released.

773
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,180
报告出来可能得好几个月
That could take months.

774
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,610
司法委员会绝不会等那么久的
There's no way the Judiciary will sit on this for that long.

775
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,580
这不正是听证会的根本问题吗
And isn't that the fundamental flaw with these hearings?

776
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,980
因为包括你在内的媒体记者提出的假设
The committee feels compelled to act because of hypotheses

777
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,940
委员会觉得必须采取行动
advanced by those in the media, such as yourself.

778
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,300
我不能代表我所有的同行  但我只是报道事实
I can't speak for all of my colleagues, but I'm just reporting facts.

779
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,840
你可能会说这是事实  但实话说
Well, you may call them facts, but if we're being honest,

780
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,020
-难道不是  -每篇文章和采访中
- aren't they just -- - In every article and interview,

781
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,100
我都只是提出怀疑
I report alleged activities.

782
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,180
怀疑重复的次数够多
And if you repeat allegations enough,

783
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,110
一遍一遍  反反复复
again and over and over and over,

784
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,450
那就三人成虎了  这是人之常情
people start to believe that they're true. That's human nature.

785
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,610
我做过调查
I've done my research.

786
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,460
冯山德已经承认洗钱
Xander Feng admitted to the money laundering.

787
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,820
但你已经不报道冯山德了  对吗
But you're no longer writing about Xander Feng. Are you?

788
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,620
你现在报道政府
You're writing about the administration.

789
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,750
事实上  听证会就是由媒体报道引发的
The truth is, these hearings have been initiated by the press.

790
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,020
我担心的是总统会遭到媒体的审判
And my fear is that the president will be tried by the press.

791
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,070
你相信他是无罪的吗
Do you believe he's innocent?

792
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,910
绝对
Absolutely.

793
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,170
我在书面声明中这么写  我现在也还要这么说
I said so in my written statement and I say so again now.

794
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,500
白宫的法律顾问已经否认了干预拉金医生的证词
The White House counsel has denied coaching Dr. Larkin,

795
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,360
-但根据...  -不管最终发现了什么
- but according to Ms. -- - Whatever comes to light,

796
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,050
都只会证明总统的清白
it will only prove the president's innocence.

797
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,750
我告诉你为什么  加勒特·沃克是我所认识的
And I'll tell you why. I have never known anyone more honest,

798
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,230
最诚实  正直  爱国的人
ethical, and patriotic than Garrett Walker.

799
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,860
他对我国宪法和法律的尊重
His reverence for the Constitution and the laws of this country

800
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,610
无人能及
are surpassed by none.

801
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,340
特莉莎和我有幸拥有一段坚固忠诚的婚姻
Tricia and I have been blessed with a strong and loving marriage.

802
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,300
但再坚固的婚姻也会面临挑战
But even strong marriages face challenges.

803
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,290
就像成百万的美国人一样
Like millions of Americans,

804
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,080
我们向一位宗教导师寻求建议
we sought counseling from a spiritual advisor,

805
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,870
而他恰好也是一位职业治疗师
one who happened also to be a professional therapist.

806
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,610
多年来我们经常
Over the years we have often

807
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,480
在困境中向我们的信仰寻求帮助
turned to our faith in times of adversity.

808
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,320
很多人批评我们
Many have criticized us.

809
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,040
但你们宁愿要一位不去寻求帮助的总统吗
But would you rather have a president that doesn't ask for help?

810
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,030
我每一天都会请我妻子帮我
I ask for help from my wife every day.

811
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,430
我们相扶相依已经有23年了
We've relied on one another for 23 years.

812
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,160
我们一起养育了两个漂亮的孩子
We've raised two beautiful children together.

813
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,950
一起走过了竞选之旅
Endured the campaign trails together.

814
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,480
从州首府丹佛
From the state capital in Denver

815
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,600
一路来到国家首都
to the nation's capital,

816
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,310
我们一直都在彼此身边
we've always been at each other's side.

817
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,030
我嫁给这个人的原因
I married this man for the

818
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,590
和你们很多人选他的原因一样
same reason that so many of you voted for him.

819
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,190
因为他是一位信徒  因为他热爱家人
Because he's a man of God. Because he believes in family.

820
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,690
因为他有同情心和爱心
Because he is compassionate and loving.

821
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,980
人无完人
Now, none of us are perfect.

822
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,550
我不是  特莉莎也不是
I'm not. Tricia's not.

823
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,930
尽管她很接近完美了
Although she certainly comes close.

824
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,290
早上好  冯先生
Good morning, Mr. Feng.

825
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,960
我不会否认我作为凡人的极限
I won't ignore what makes me human.

826
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,640
否则只是盲目
That's a form of blindness.

827
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:55,170
好的领导者应该正视自己的缺点
Good leadership means tackling my imperfections head on.

828
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,110
对一个在逃亡的人来说不错嘛
Not bad for a man on the run.

829
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,240
你是说对一个有豁免权的人来说
You mean a man with immunity.

830
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,510
随便你想怎么说了
Wherever you're most comfortable.

831
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,930
我们有很多事要谈
We have a lot to discuss.

832
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,780
我是在了解情况的前提下这么做的
I do so with open eyes.

833
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,690
我的爱也是明明白白的
Just as I love, with open eyes,

834
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,470
爱我的妻子  爱上帝
my wife, my maker,

835
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,370
爱我的国家
and my country.

836
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,230
请进
Come in.

837
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,480
谢谢  密查姆
Thank you, Meechum.

838
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,470
杰姬  这种情况下  一般来说我会去找你
Jackie, in these circumstances normally I would come to you,

839
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,030
但现在我们表面上还是保持距离为好
but we need to keep a public distance for the time being.

840
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,740
我以为我是来讨论性侵法案的
I thought I was here to discuss the sexual assault bill.

841
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,970
-是的  -还有其他事
- You are. - Among other things.

842
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,710
明白了
I see.

843
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,100
你有条件
There's a price.

844
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,510
不要这样说
Well, we don't think of it that way.

845
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,680
不管今天你说什么  我都会支持你的法案
I'm going to support your bill, no matter what you say today.

846
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,230
什么事
Regarding?

847
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,560
弹劾
Impeachment.

848
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,320
如果事情真闹到司法委员会
Well, if it goes to the Judiciary --

849
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,280
几乎肯定是会的
It most definitely will.

850
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,950
我不那么肯定
I'm not sure about that.

851
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,450
你们看了总统的声明了吗
Did you see the president's address?

852
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,250
我们看了
We did.

853
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,230
我觉得能起些作用  控制事态
I think it will help. Stop the bleeding.

854
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,370
而且弹劾可以被否决
Impeachment can be defeated.

855
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,070
但那是我们要避免的
But that's we need to avoid.

856
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,090
你希望弹劾
You want impeachment...

857
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,060
为什么要打一场明知会输的仗
Why fight a losing battle?

858
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,040
我们在众议院是多数党
We have a majority in the House.

859
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,060
现在是
We do now.

860
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,140
但如果本党不能和一个污点总统划清界限
But if this party fails to distance itself from a toxic president...

861
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,540
我们在做长远打算
We're thinking ahead here.

862
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:29,130
所以我才会找你就法案的事和解
It's why I came to you about the bill.

863
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,320
我们不值得为它翻脸
Because it wasn't worth burning a bridge over.

864
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,630
长远来讲  我们合作的好处更多
In the long run we have a lot more to gain by working together.

865
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,910
我不明白
I don't understand.

866
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,660
你在《电讯报》采访的时候说你会
You said in the Telegraph article that you would sta--

867
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,970
我必须那么说
I had to.

868
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,350
我的办公室跟总统的只隔了三个房间
My office is three doors down from the president's.

869
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,410
我不能公开诋毁他
I can't publicly deride him.

870
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,870
你要我来
You want me to do it?

871
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,790
我们想要你做你最拿手的  拉选票
We want you to do what you do so well: whip the votes.

872
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,390
我不能背叛总统
I can't abandon the president.

873
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
如果本党救了他
If the party rescues him,

874
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,400
我们将在中期选举时失去50个席位
we'll lose 50 seats in the House in the midterms.

875
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,080
你会失去你在领导层的地位
You will lose your position in the leadership.

876
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,550
我们要花十年
And it will take us a decade

877
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,350
重新赢得选民的信任
to regain the trust of the electorate.

878
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,260
我们只求你肯听取意见
All we're asking is that you have an open mind.

879
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,660
克莱尔就是如此
Claire kept an open mind,

880
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,090
你得以修改性侵法案
and you'll pass sexual assault reform as a result.

881
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,320
你不能把弹劾和...
You can't possibly compare impeachment to --

882
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,920
只是举个例子  杰姬
It's an illustration, Jackie.

883
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,140
说明未来会怎么样
Of what the future looks like.

884
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,320
我们提出的  是进步
What we offer is progress.

885
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,530
并保证日后还会有更多进步
With a promise of more to come.

886
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,020
这只是个开始  杰姬
It's only the beginning, Jackie.

887
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,060
坚决  务实  记得吗
Ruthless pragmatism, remember?

888
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,970
所以我才选你做党鞭
That's why I wanted you to be the whip.

889
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,060
我们三个是同一类人
The three of us, we're cut from the same cloth.

890
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,790
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President,

891
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,020
你要我做的  几乎是叛国
what you're asking is just shy of treason.

892
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,820
几乎  也就是政治
Just shy. Which is politics.

893
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,230
小心  那很易碎
Be careful. It's delicate.

894
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,470
这是什么
What is it?

895
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,310
一件我做了很久的事
Something I've been working on for a very long time.

896
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,740
马上就要完成了
And it's nearly finished.

897
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,320
杰姬
Jackie?

898
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,600
帮我们完成吧
Help us finish it.

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国法律规定  在总统或其他政府要员  联邦法官
出现重大工作失误  或有严重违法嫌疑时
国会有权行使弹劾权力  弹劾程序启动后
首先要求众议院投票  简单多数通过弹劾决议后
再由参议院进行表决
但是只有在参议院2/3的多数投赞成票后
弹劾才会生效
以防止两党以弹劾作为政治斗争的武器

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}虽然美国历史上许多总统在任期间曾爆出丑闻
但是国会真正启动弹劾程序只有两次
1868年  国会以违反行政任命法为由投票弹劾时任总统安德鲁·杰克逊
但是在参议院投票时  一票之差  弹劾案没有获得所需的2/3多数
第二次弹劾程序启动要等到一百多年之后
在上世纪90年代  总统克林顿深陷莱温斯基丑闻
在国会占有多数席位的共和党启动弹劾程序
但是同样没有获得足够票数  克林顿涉险过关
由于他任职期间美国经济高速发展
所以虽然丑闻缠身  但是克林顿民意支持率一直很高
在人们所熟知的水门事件中  没有启动弹劾程序
在国会考虑进行弹劾前  尼克松总统便已经宣布辞职
