佐伊...
Did Zoe...?

62
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,370
是的  但还不止
Yeah. But that's not all.

63
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,990
他们还找到了瑞秋
They tracked down Rachel, too.

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
弗兰西斯
Francis?

65

Tell me about Rachel. Where is she?

66
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,770
我控制住她了
I have her under control.

67
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,230
答非所问
That's not what I asked.

68
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,130
我送她回家了  不用担心她
I drove her home. We don't have to worry about her.

69
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,110
你当初也这么说斯克斯基女士
You said the same about Ms. Skorsky.

70
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,440
还有别人吗
Anyone else involved?

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,770
只有简宁和佐伊
Just Janine and Zoe.

72
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,940
他们在查罗素酒驾的事
They asked about Russo's arrest

73
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,990
而且知道他去找过科佩尼科
and they know he went to see Kapeniak.

74
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,850
我想他们应该就知道这些了
I assume that's as far as they've gotten.

75
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,370
不要想当然
Assume nothing.

76
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,130
我去告诉巴尼·豪尔
I'll alert Barney Hull.

你周二就又老一岁了
You're another year older on Tuesday.

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,900

And we can't have a vice president who smokes.

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,530
你能结束吗
Can you finish?

85
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,490

What?

86
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,290
我完事了
I'm good.

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,890
你怎么了
What's wrong?

88
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,470
没什么  就是完事了
Nothing. I just said finish.

89
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,610
我不想...如果你不想...
Well, I don't want just -- if you're not...

90
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,150
好吧  随便了
Okay, fine. Whatever.

91
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,200
佐伊  是我做错了什么吗
Zoe, did I do something that made you...?

92
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,180
没有
No.

93
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,030
佐伊  你不能说一句完事了  然后就停下啊
Zoe, you can't say something like "just finish" and then shut down.

94
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,500
这里很安全  佐伊  我不是他
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.

Good morning.

97
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,830
理查德·拉塞尔
Richard Russell.

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,830
{\an8}长期反对民权运动

99
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,230
1963年  《民权法案》
Civil Rights Act. 1963.

100
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,460
不是所有人都能留下美名
Not everyone can be on the right side of history.

101
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,110
连林登也曾站错队
No, not even Lyndon for a time,

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,740
但没有拉塞尔  林登也当不上多数党领袖
but he would have never become majority leader without him.

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,430
但是没有约翰逊参议院大楼
Well, there's no Johnson Senate building.

104
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,430
{\an8}有拉塞尔参议院大楼

105
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,580
是啊  只能委屈他拿一栋总统图书馆凑合了
No. He had to settle for a presidential library.

106
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,760
我们都好久没机会聊聊了
So it's been some time since you and I have had a chance to catch up.

107
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,500
你的工作做得很出色  杰姬
You've been an outstanding deputy, Jackie.

108
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,340
比你那些老练的同事还高效
Far more effective than your more seasoned colleagues.

109
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,220
你能建立同盟  必要时还有股狠劲
You're a coalition builder, a fighter when you have to be.

110
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,340
告诉我  你怎么看自己的前途
Tell me, where do you see yourself headed?

111
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,900
我想做众议院军事委员会主席
I'd like to aim for the chair of Armed Services.

112
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,360
或者众议院国土安全委员会主席
Or Homeland Security.

113
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,930
你考虑过进入领导层吗
Have you ever considered serving in the leadership?

114
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,870
我想那至少也得等八...十年了
I figure that might be possible eight, ten years from now.

115
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,440
如果我说你这一届就能进入领导层呢
Well, what if I suggested that you could serve in leadership this term.

116
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,060
接替我  做党鞭
To replace me. As whip.

117
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,370
你要接任副总统了
You're being tapped for VP.

118
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,050
就算是这样吧
Let's assume that's true.

119
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,870
-这也说得通  但我做党鞭  -是的
- Well, that makes sense. But me as whip? - Yes.

120
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,040
我只是个第三任女议员
A third-term congresswoman?

121
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,900
你的能力有目共睹  而且还参过战
A universally admired incumbent who also happens to be a war veteran.

122
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,550
按顺序也该是韦伯  或巴克沃特
Webb is next in line. Or Buchwalter.

123
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,870
所以  你想想这意味着什么
So just consider that for a moment.

124
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,530
他们会牵制彼此的选票
They'll draw votes from one another.

125
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,470
我可没说你会赢得很轻松
Oh, I'm not saying you wouldn't have to fight for it,

126
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,390
但我愿意帮你
but I'd be willing to give you the ammunition.

127
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,940
过来
Come over here.

128
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,560
这是什么
What is this?

129
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,100
我关于韦伯和巴克沃特的文件
My files on Webb and Buchwalter.

130
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,300
你自己看看吧
Why don't you take a look?

131
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,390
我们过几天再谈
We'll speak in a few days.

132
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,030
还有一个关于你的文件夹
Oh, and, uh, there's one on you.

133
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,400
或许你会想先读那个
You might want to begin by reading that one first.

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,930
简宁怎么说
What'd Janine say?

135
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,650
脱衣舞俱乐部还没开
Strip club's not open yet.

136
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,840
你去查科佩尼科的事吗
You'll look into Kapeniak?

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,660
如果他出现  我就能找到他
If he's on the grid, I'll find him.

138
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,310
-送我去地铁中心站  -不去办公室吗
- Drop me at metro center. - Not the office?

139
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,670
我要去找瑞秋
I'm gonna talk to Rachel.

140
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,890
她会像昨晚那样否认一切的
She'll deny everything, like she did last night.

141
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,570
她不能否认上了斯坦普的车  你看到她了
She can't deny getting into Stamper's car. You saw her.

142
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,680
或许你可以拿篇报道她爸爸的稿子给她看
Maybe you send a version of the story, about her dad?

143
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,710
没人会发表的
No one would print it.

144
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,990
可瑞秋不知道啊
Rachel doesn't know that.

145
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,390
她说"随你便  贱人"
She said, "Go to town, bitch."

146
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,360
不会管用的  我得当面跟她谈
It won't work. I have to get in her face.

147
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,610
恭喜
Congratulations.

148
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,250
-我们都替你高兴  -谢谢
- We're thrilled for you. - Thank you.

149
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,290
我想亲自跟鲍勃和泰瑞说
I wanted to fill in Bob and Terry personally.

150
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,280
我们快开始吧  我什么时候出发去匹兹堡
Now let's get to it. I have to leave for Pittsburgh in what?

151
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,200
20分钟后
20 minutes.

152
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,210
帮吉姆冲刺  就要到终点了
Home stretch with Jim. Whistle-stop tour.

153
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,290
现在形势很好
Looking good out there.

154
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,170
的确  但我们还是不想冒险
Very good. But we don't want to take any chances.

155
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,080
接替你的党鞭人选  弗兰克
Now, your replacement as whip, Frank.

156
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,800
鲍勃已经提出了一些想法
Bob has already shared some thoughts.

157
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
我喜欢霍华德·韦伯
I like Howard Webb.

158
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,800
韦伯不错  你考虑过韦斯·巴克沃特吗
Webb is a solid choice. Have you thought about Wes Buchwalter?

159
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,210
巴克沃特太冲动
Buchwalter's a hot-head.

160
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,280
那么韦伯你觉得可以吗  弗兰克
Well, could you live with Webb, Frank?

161
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,880
韦伯懂战术  但做事虎头蛇尾
Webb is a good tactician, but he lacks follow-through.

162
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,280
巴克沃特是个粗人
The problem with Buchwalter is he's too abrasive.

163
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,100
毫无魅力  树敌太多
No charm. Lots of enemies.

164
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,070
还有别的选择吗
Is there a third option?

165
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,370
他们是党团资历最深的两位  轮到他们了
They're the two most senior members in the caucus. It's their turn.

166
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,830
总统先生  可不可以让党内成员一起挑选
Mr. President, what if we let the caucus pick?

167
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,350
大家公平竞争  他们两人都很有资质
Let it be a wide-open race. Both men are qualified.

168
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,160
领导层在这事上要意见一致
The leadership should be united in this.

169
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,980
我们不能各自支持不同的候选人  弗兰克
We don't want to be backing different candidates, Frank.

170
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,260
那我们就干脆别插手  谁都别支持谁
So we stay out of it and neither of us backs anyone.

171
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,940
这挺好
I like it.

172
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,680
党团会尊重凭实力竞争上来的人
Caucus will respect someone who did it the old-fashioned way.

173
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,350
几位  这事你们做主
Well, gentlemen, it's your call to make.

174
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,640
你们自己讨论决定  然后告诉我
Figure it out amongst yourselves. Let me know what you decide.

175
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,870
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

176
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,370
帮我接刘易斯部长
Put me through to Secretary Lewis.

177
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,570
弗兰克  我不想为这事跟你争
Frank, I don't want to go to battle with you on this.

178
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,630
我们犯过这种错
We've been down that road.

179
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,890
说得是啊
I couldn't agree more.

180
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,240
公平竞争让我紧张
An open race makes me nervous.

181
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,300
我只是提议一下
Well, look, it was just a suggestion.

182
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,290
-我再想想吧  -谢谢
- I'll put some thought into it. - Thank you.

183
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,980
我去做做他的工作吧
You know, let me -- let me go work on him.

184
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,210
祝你好运了
Good luck.

185
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,710
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

186
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,270
问我要点什么
Ask me what I want to order.

187
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,790
想好点什么了吗  先生
Have you decided, sir?

188
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,870
你马上辞职  告诉里昂你不干了
I need you to quit your job. Tell Leon it's your last day.

189
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,280
为什么
Why?

190
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,740
表现自然点
Act normal.

191
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,610
要什么配菜
Did you want a side with that?

192
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,940
他们能找到你一次
They found you once.

193
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,720
不能冒险再有第二次
We can't take the chance they'll find you again.

194
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,420
我去哪弄钱
What am I supposed to do about money?

195
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,700
照我说的做  回家  收拾东西
Do as I say. Go home and pack your things.

196
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,740
我十点过来
I'll come by around ten.

197
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,550
-那我就无权决定...  -够了
- Well -- but I don't get a say in any... - Stop it.

198
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,430
只收拾一个箱子
One suitcase. That's it.

199
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,560
-你至少也告诉我...  -我要肉馅土豆馅饼
- Can you at least tell me... - I'll take the shepherd's pie

200
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,490
配菜要球芽甘蓝
with a side of Brussels sprouts.

201
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,630
带走
To go.

202
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,190
我们不想上法庭  她的律师不想上法庭
We don't want a trial. Her lawyers don't want a trial.

203
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,380
但科尔女士就是不听劝
But Ms. Cole won't listen to reason.

204
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,660
即便如此  如果你再给我点时间
That said, if you give me a little more time, I think that --

205
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,140
如果她想上法庭  那就随她
If she wants to go to court, then let's give her that.

206
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,500
虽然她现在不肯讲理  不代表将来...
Just because she's being unreasonable now doesn't mean she --

207
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,480
我受够了
I'm done.

208
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,930
你这是膝跳反应
That's a knee-jerk reaction.

209
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,080
我知道你不是个不理智不耐心的人
I've never known you to be a person who was irrational or impatient.

210
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,440
我再去找找她的律师  或许我们...
Let me check back with her lawyers, and maybe we can --

211
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,370
最早什么时候能开庭
What's the soonest we can get a trial date?

212
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:51,910
克莱尔
Claire...

213
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,310
给我个大致时间
Give me a timeframe.

214
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,850
最早也六个月后吧
Six months, at the earliest.

215
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,290
转告她那边  然后就中止沟通
Inform her people, then no more communication.

216
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,960
作为你的律师  我有责任强烈建议你不要这么做
As your counsel, it is my duty to strongly advise you against this.

217
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,090
我明白  谢谢你  奥利弗
I understand and I thank you, Oliver.

218
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,320
谢谢
Thank you.

219
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,390
-怎么样  -他们不肯透露私人联络方式
- So? - They wouldn't give me individual contact info,

220
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,200
但这里是过去三年在东非工作过的
but here's every doctor who served in east Africa

221
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,530
所有医生的名单
during the last three years.

222
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,820
健康维护组织呢
And what about the HMO?

223
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,820
{\an8}收取固定预付费用后  为特定地区主动参保人群提供全面医疗服务的体系

224
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,480
需要同意书  也在袋子里了
You need a consent form. And it's in the packet.

225
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,120
有事吗
Can I help you?

226
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,040
我找瑞秋·波斯纳
Yeah. I'm looking for Rachel Posner.

227
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,780
她不在
She's not here.

228
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,690
她晚些时候会来吗
Uh, is she coming in later?

229
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,650
干什么
Why?

230
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,220
我认识她
I know her.

231
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,920
你朋友可把我害惨了
Well, your friend really screwed me over.

232
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,190
怎么回事
What happened?

233
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,190
她上班上到一半就跑了
She took off, middle of her shift.

234
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,160
我不得不去找我的房东来帮忙
I had to put my hostess on wait staff duty.

235
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,760
我有点担心  瑞秋有麻烦
Look, I'm concerned. Rachel's in real trouble.

236
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,870
我才不管她的私人问题呢
I don't care what her personal issues are.

237
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,130
我只想知道她住哪
I just need to know where she lives.

238
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,160
你们不是认识吗
I thought you knew her.

239
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,150
我们认识  但有日子没见了
I do. It's just been a while.

240
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,580
她给我发短信说她想自残
And she sent me a text message saying she wants to hurt herself.

241
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,380
现在又不接电话
And now she won't answer her phone.

242
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,320
她有精神病史
She has a history of mental illness.

243
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,470
你得帮帮我啊
You've gotta help me out.

244
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,910
我帮不了
Look, I can't.

245
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,080
她的工资和税务报表  上面的地址是个邮箱
Her W-2, the address is a P.O. Box.

246
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,670

247
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,980
-我去办公室帮你看看  -谢谢

如果你找到她  叫她别回来了

249
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,100
我才不需要疯子来我这儿捣乱
I don't need some nutcase creating chaos in here.

250
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,280
-南茜  -是  先生

251
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,330

在办公室  还有

262
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,420

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,990
马里兰  巴尔的摩北30分钟路程

That's close to home.

265
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,150
我们想让她消失  但我们得能找到她
We want her to disappear, but not on us.

266
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,200
-好吧  一次性电话买好了吗  -嗯

268
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,900
预付款的  你只要开机拨号就行
It's prepaid. All you need to do is turn it on and dial.

269
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,770
电话记录还得处理掉
We still have the phone history.

270
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,160
所以日后更要小心了
All the more reason to be safe going forward.

271
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,580
克里斯蒂娜怎么样了
Where are we with Christina?

272
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,460

I'm on it.

273
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,340
安排她去琳达手下  我今早打过电话了

274
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,940
你是吉莉安·科尔吗
Are you Gillian Cole?

275
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,500
是的  我们认识吗
Yeah. Uh, have we met?

276
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,290
没有  但你认识我丈夫
No, we haven't met. You know my husband.

277
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,300
你丈夫
Your husband?

278
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,720
大卫·阿普博姆
David Applebaum.

279
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,170
看来是真的喽
So it's true.

280
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,590
那只是个错误
It was a mistake.

281
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,160
你想看看我们的孩子吗  我可以给你看看照片
You want to see our kids? I can show you pictures.

282
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,490
阿普博姆太太  我...
Mrs. Applebaum, I -- I'm...

283
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,750
你以为你是谁啊
Who the fuck do you think you are?

284
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,990
我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

285
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,170
你抱歉  我觉得你并不抱歉
You're sorry? I don't think you're sorry.

286
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,620
而且你也休想
And don't think for a second

287
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,320
凭这个孩子来向我们要钱
you're gonna use that baby to get money out of us.

288
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
他根本不知道我怀孕了
He doesn't even know I'm pregnant.

289
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,500
但你知道他是有妇之夫
But you knew he was married.

290
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,110
你怎么能这样
How could you?

291
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,710
-他说起过我们吗  -没有
- Did he talk about us? - No.

292
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,240
说谎的婊子  我让你难堪了吗
Lying bitch. Am I embarrassing you?

293
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,060
你想过这对我和我孩子的羞辱吗
Did you think about how you would humiliate me and my kids?

294
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,150
再跟别人老公上床记得戴套
Use a condom the next time you fuck somebody's husband.

295
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,070
还不到24小时
It's been less than 24 hours.

296
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,030
她正在上班就突然辞职了
She quits her job in the middle of a shift?

297
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,920
她害怕了
She's scared.

298
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,250
换了我也会跑
I'd take off, too.

299
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,520
是安德伍德
It's Underwood.

300
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,280
他行动比我们快
He's moving faster than we are.

301
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,710
脱衣舞女呢
What about the stripper?

302
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,510
不肯开口
Refuses to talk.

303
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,720
科佩尼科呢
Kapeniak?

304
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
住址不详  没兄弟姐妹  父母双亡
No current address. No siblings. Parents are dead.

305
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,310
瑞秋是唯一的机会
Rachel's the last loose end.

306
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,370
除了酒驾  她肯定还知道点别的
She must know something else. Bigger than the DUI.

307
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,960
知道她去哪了吗
Any idea where she went?

308
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,460
有个杜邦的邮箱地址  但管理员都没见过她
I got a P.O. Box in Dupont, but none of the clerks have seen her.

309
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,170
我可以去那里守株待兔
I could go stake it out, but...

310
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,030
你找过你的人了吗
Have you talked to your guy yet?

311
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,400
明后天吧
In the next day or two.

312
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,150
他会把罗素自杀的警方报告拿给我
He's bringing me the police report on Russo's suicide.

313
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,380
我尽量多套些信息
I'll press him for more.

314
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,940
你下一步怎么办
And what's your next move?

315
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,030
想想怎么回复这个
Trying to figure out how to respond to this.

316
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,310
几个小时前收到的
I got it a couple hours ago.

317
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,300
他是在给你下套
I think he's setting her up.

318
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,280
我知道怎么应付他
I know how to handle him.

319
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,430
他知道的越少越好
The less he learns, the better.

320
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,600
我们也许能打探到消息
We might learn something.

321
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,780
是他说了算  怎么打探
Not with him calling the shots.

322
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,090
地点是我定
I'm choosing the place.

323
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,070
有什么区别
As if that makes a difference.

324
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,550
我又不会跟他上床  就是谈话
I'm not gonna fuck him. Just talk to him.

325
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,580
我去下洗手间
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

326
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,950
-抱歉  我不该  -没关系
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -- - That's okay.

327
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,350
有关系
No, it's not.

328
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,240
我不希望你疏忽大意
I just don't want you to be careless.

329
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,400
不会的
I won't be.

330
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,130
你不想有自己的生活
You want no life?

331
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,400
想一个人做三个人的工作吗
You want more work than three people can handle?

332
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,380
你想找个第一个月
You want a decent chance

333
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,900
就可能被炒的工作吗
that you could be fired within the first month?

334
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,630
如果你感兴趣  咱就接着谈
If that tempts you, we can keep talking.

335
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,050
那些都不是问题
None of that intimidates me.

336
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,930
过去九周里我都在管理一个选区
I've been running a congressional district for the past nine weeks

337
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,570
而且没人帮我
with zero assistance.

338
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,960
没人选举我
Nobody elected me.

339
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,200
没人教我怎么做
Nobody taught me.

340
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,350
我那么做是因为总得有人来做
I've done it because somebody had to.

341
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,070
罗素的事是个悲剧
What happened was tragic.

342
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,290
可我不会同情你
But you won't get sympathy from me.

343
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,010
我没有时间
I don't have time for it.

344
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,420
我要是想博取同情  也不会到这儿来
I wouldn't be sitting here if I wanted a shoulder to cry on.

345
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,660
瑞秋
Rachel?

346
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,840
走开
Leave.

347
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,090
我说走开
I said leave.

348
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
收拾好了吗
Are you packed?

349
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,760
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

350
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,170
你今天没辞职
So you didn't quit today.

351
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,740
辞了  可我改主意了
I did, but I changed my mind.

352
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,630
这事由不得你
This isn't your decision to make.

353
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,150
我要回去工作  继续住这儿
I'm keeping my job and I'm keeping this apartment.

354
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,490
不行
No, you're not.

355
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,300
你答应过  会让这些都过去
You promised you'd make all of this go away.

356
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,270
所以你得重新开始
And you starting over is the first --

357
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,260
我已经重新开始了  不想再来一次了
No, I already started over. I don't want to start over again.

358
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,190
我也不想你这样
I wish you didn't have to.

359
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,890
滚出去
Get out.

360
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,860
滚出去
Get out!

361
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,270
小点声
Lower your voice.

362
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,570
我杀了你
I'll fucking kill you.

363
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,460
动手吧
Go ahead.

364
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,100
只有我能保护你  你还不明白吗
I am the only one who can protect you. Don't you see that?

365
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,470
你不知道自己现在多危险
You have no idea how much danger you're in.

366
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,330
收拾东西吧
Start packing.

367
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,080
我每年都得问一句
You know I ask every year.

368
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,760
不过生日  像往年一样
Nothing, as usual.

369
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,030
我们可以吃顿晚餐
I thought we could have dinner.

370
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,100
除非是去个没人会认出我们的地方
Only if it's someplace where nobody will recognize us.

371
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,060
我不想谁走过来...
I don't want anyone walking up --

372
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,780
我是说在家  我可以做点菜
I mean at home. I'll cook something.

373
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,100
不要蛋糕
No cake.

374
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,690
不买蛋糕
No cake.

375
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,530
不要礼物
No gifts.

376
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,600
不买礼物
No gifts.

377
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,700
那行  诉讼怎么样了
I can do that. How's the lawsuit coming?

378
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,860
我们不会有事的
We'll be fine.

379
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,780
我们打算将您的安保规模
We'd like to increase the size of your detail

380
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,330
增至国家元首级别  从明天开始
to full head of state status, starting tomorrow.

381
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,030
这可不行
Well, that won't be happening.

382
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,090
提前准备总是没错的
It's good to get a head start,

383
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,240
这样等他们宣布...
so that by the time they announce --

384
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,250
在我彻底失去隐私之前就剩这几天了
These are my last few days before I never have privacy again.

385
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,790
我要尽量好好享受这几天
I intend to savor these moments for as long as I can.

386
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,350
但是先生  出于安全考虑  我认为...
But, sir, in terms of safety, I think --

387
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,080
在国会表决认可我为副总统之前
Until I'm confirmed as the Vice President,

388
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,080
{\an8}副总统一职空缺后  由总统提名  国会两院多数票决认可  才算生效

389
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,530
安保问题仍是我来决定  对吗
security is at my discretion. Is that correct?

390
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,490
理论上是的  但是...
Technically, yes. But --

391
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,760
那不就得了
Then that's settled.

392
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,410
那好吧  我们等正式宣布
All right. We'll wait until the announcement.

393
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,370
那么  经国会认可后
Now, assuming the confirmation goes through,

394
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,970
我们就要解决您搬入
we'll need to work out the logistics

395
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,130
海军天文台的后勤工作
of moving you into the Naval Observatory.

396
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,130
{\an8}天文台地界内的"天文台一号圈"为美国副总统官邸

397
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,820
这也不行
That won't be happening, either.

398
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,210
议员会继续住在他的别墅里
The congressman will be remaining in his townhouse.

399
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,160
但那里没有必要的安保基建
But it doesn't have the necessary security infrastructure.

400
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,630
那你们就去建啊
Then you'll need to build it.

401
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,730
要建防爆设施
We're talking blast-proofing,

402
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,670
固定线路通信网络  24小时办公室空间
hardwired communications networks, 24-hour office space --

403
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,640
有志者事竟成
Where there's a will, there's a way.

404
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,920
我会直接跟你联络  讨论改建计划
I'll contact you directly about setting a plan in motion.

405
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,960
你走之前  还有件事
And one last thing before you go.

406
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,110
把艾德华·密查姆安排在我的安保队伍里
I'd like to have Edward Meechum serve on my detail.

407
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,300
他是国会警察
He's Capitol Police.

408
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,700
目前是  你要调他去特勤处
For now. You're about to appoint him to the Secret Service.

409
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,890
那得经过加速培训
That would require an accelerated training program.

410
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,810
先生  我们有很多合格的特工
Sir, we have plenty of qualified agents.

411
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,450
有男有女  都有丰富经验
Men and women with years of experience.

412
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,990
我很期待与他们合作
And I look forward to working with all of them,

413
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,080
只要艾德华·密查姆也是安保队一员就行
as long as Edward Meechum is on the detail.

414
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,850
多谢你前来
Thank you very much for your time.

415
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,310
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

416
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,730
南茜  让密查姆把车开过来
Nancy, have Meechum bring the car around.

417
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,650
上一次就是最后一次
You know, the last time was the last time.

418
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,620
我知道  但这很重要
I know. But this is important.

419
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,790
你总想拉我下水  我不干了
You keep selling me that swampland. I'm done buying.

420
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,280
再也不干了
No more.

421
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,470
掩盖酒驾的事  你说能牵扯到巴尼·豪尔
Cover-up. You said it went as high as Barney Hull.

422
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,740
我不是那么说的
That's not what I said.

423
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,020
你把瑞秋·波斯纳的拘捕记录给我时...
When you gave me Rachel Posner's arrest file --

424
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,890
我说的是  肯定有大人物干预  记录才会消失
What I said is that arrests don't disappear without a big-ass wand.

425
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,260
那可不能当做证据
That ain't the same as proof.

426
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,170
我们认为这事牵扯到议会领导层
We think the congressional leadership took part.

427
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,000
我才不关心
I don't care.

428
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,180
不  你关心  我知道你关心的
Yes, you do. I know you do.

429
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,610
不  我真的不关心
No, I really don't.

430
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,850
当年你帮我暴露毒品...
When you helped me expose the drug --

431
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,450
他们不过是拿点小恩小惠的街头黑警
They were dirty street cops stuffing a few grams in their pockets.

432
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,010
这事可不一样  都是有权有势的大人物
This is different. Powerful fucking people.

433
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,080
黑警就是黑警  你想保护他们吗
Dirty cops are dirty cops. You want to protect them?

434
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,280
我还有养老保险和家人
I have a pension and a family.

435
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,110
我明白  但是...
I understand. But --

436
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,960
不要再联系我了
Don't contact me again.

437
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,960
你的手机在哪
Where's your cell?

438
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,950
这里  我没在录音
Here. It's not recording.

439
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,780
你得删掉我们之间所有的通话记录
I need to ask you to delete all of our phone history.

440
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,760
我为什么要删掉
Why would I do that?

441
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,680
我这是在保护我们两个人
I'm trying to protect both you and I.

442
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,100
要坐牢的又不是我
I'm not facing prison.

443
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,630
他酒驾不是你替他掩盖的吗
You didn't cover up the arrest?

444
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,300
是不是因为你想让他竞选州长
Is it because you wanted him to be governor?

445
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,370
不是  他惹了麻烦  我就伸了援手
No. He was in trouble, so I helped.

446
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,400
之后他表现出参选意愿  我就提供了指导
And later he expressed a desire to run, and I offered guidance.

447
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,710
指导一个酒鬼吗
To an alcoholic?

448
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,330
他当时戒了酒  正在恢复中
To a sober recovering alcoholic.

449
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,460
你是指望他会自毁前程吗
Did you want him to self-sabotage?

450
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,370
当然不是
Absolutely not.

451
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,190
他没戏了  马修斯才来参选
It got Matthews in the race.

452
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,860
我愿意支持有上进心的人
I like to back people who want to succeed.

453
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,680
比如说你自己
Take yourself as an example.

454
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,630
你不过是渔翁得利
You just took advantage of the situation.

455
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
得利的是马修斯  我没指望能当副总统啊
Matthews took advantage. I didn't seek the nomination.

456
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,840
罗素死的时候坐在副驾座上
Russo was in the passenger seat when he died.

457
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,390
这话不准确
That's not entirely accurate.

458
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,440
我看过警方报告
I saw the police report.

459
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,360
我还直接和警局局长谈过呢
And I spoke to the commissioner directly,

460
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,860
因为我关心彼得  我想了解全部细节
because I cared about Peter and I wanted to know the full story.

461
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,350
那他没坐在副驾座上吗
He wasn't in the passenger seat?

462
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,650
副驾座的车门开着  他半边身子躺在外面
The passenger door was open, and he was halfway out.

463
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,560
警方认为
They think that...

464
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,540
他可能中途后悔了
he might have had second thoughts.

465
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,460
如果我去问巴尼·豪尔  他会证实你的话吗
If I speak to Barney Hull, he'll confirm that?

466
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,920
你什么意思  佐伊
What are you suggesting, Zoe?

467
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,420
也许有人谋杀了他
Maybe there was foul play.

468
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,800
要是有任何谋杀的迹象
If there was a hint of foul play,

469
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,880
你觉得警方会不去调查吗
don't you think the police would have investigated?

470
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
就这些掩盖他酒驾的警察吗
The same police that buried his DUI?

471
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,130
你认为我也脱不了干系
And you think I was involved.

472
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,890
你们之间有联系
There's a connection between you.

473
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,780
听听你在说什么  荒唐至极
listen to you. You sound ludicrous.

474
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,200
我只是问问而已
I'm just asking questions.

475
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,530
不  你这是在瞎猜  瞎联系
No, you're connecting dots that don't exist.

476
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,580
你想让我别插手  装作什么都不知道
You want me to just walk away? Act as if I don't know anything?

477
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,970
没错  是我替彼得解了围
Yes, I got Peter out of a jam.

478
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,030
没错  我让他去找科佩尼科
Yes, I sent him to speak to Kapeniak.

479
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,050
但除此之外  就没别的了
But beyond that, there's nothing to know.

480
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,720
别怪我  但现在我实在没法相信你的话
Can you blame me if I find it difficult to trust you right now?

481
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,120
信不信随你
Trust me or not,

482
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,000
我很快就要获得认可正式成为副总统了
but I'm about to be confirmed as the vice president.

483
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,560
我们的合作关系已经延伸到总统层面了
And our relationship extends to the Oval Office now.

484
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,330
别无缘无故地没事找事
Don't step out of the sunlight for no reason.

485
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,790
让我们忘记过去  展开新的合作
Let's start this new chapter with a clean slate.

486
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,130
你回去好好想想  我会联系你
Now you sleep on that, and I'll be in touch.

487
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,060
我们先做血液和激素检测
We'll start with blood and hormone tests.

488
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,060
结果几天之内就能出来
Those results should be back within a few days.

489
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,650
如果结果不错
If they're good,

490
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,440
我们就开始对你和你丈夫进行基因检测
we'll move on to genetic testing for both you and your husband.

491
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,390
你和他谈过了吗
Have you spoken to him yet?

492
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,730
还没有  我想先做检测
Not yet. I want to do the tests first.

493
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,620
这周什么时间做都可以
We can do those anytime this week.

494
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,490
我会让我的人跟你这边联络
I'll have my office call yours.

495
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,960
差点忘了
I almost forgot.

496
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,080
我上网做了些研究
I've been doing some research on the Internet.

497
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,890
网上的话不能都信啊
Be careful of the Internet.

498
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,990
我在搜索四十岁以上孕妇的
Well, I was looking into common issues

499
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,010
孕期常见问题时
associated with post-40 pregnancies,

500
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,930
查到了一个药物
and this drug came up.

501
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,230
但没查到什么详细信息  它叫静脉
But there wasn't much on it. It's Cruvenae...

502
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,080
静脉雌酮
Cruvenae-tenuestrin.

503
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,020
你没找到详细信息是因为这种药
You probably haven't found much because it's,

504
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,660
还处在测试阶段
still in the beta stage.

505
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,380
这药物有什么疗效
And what does it do?

506
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,320
它能促进血液流往胎盘
It helps maximize blood flow to the placenta.

507
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,010
此前还没有哪种药物能做到这一点
Until CVT there hasn't been any viable drug for that.

508
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,080
这药目前仍有争议
The jury's still out.

509
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,810
但是各年龄段的女性都可能患上胎盘机能不全
But placental insufficiency affects women of all ages.

510
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,960
你现在先别担心这个
I wouldn't worry about it for now.

511
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,360
我们还是按部就班  慢慢来
That's putting the cart way before the horse.

512
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,230
马修斯已经稳操胜券
You know, Matthews has this locked up,

513
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,700
但是国会保守人士认为
but conservatives on the hill are saying

514
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,550
他这次重回州长之位  还会像从前一样
he's gonna return to Harrisburg with the same myopic,

515
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,390
目光短浅  增加赤字
deficit-growing mentality.

516
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,310
至于马修斯获胜后接任副总统的人选
Now, as to who's gonna replace Matthews when he wins...

517
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,580
我把墙灯关上不碍事吧
Can I at least turn off the overhead?

518
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,700
当然没事
Of course.

519
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,940
...还能有谁在财政上更恣意妄为...
...someone even more fiscally irresponsible...

520
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,540
需要我去楼下工作吗
Do you want me to go work downstairs?

521
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,230
不用  没事  给我腾个地方就行
No. That's fine. Just make some room.

522
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,670
你还没表态呢
You haven't said a word.

523
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,240
是的
No.

524
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,010
那我们怎么办
Where does that leave us?

525
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,730
我完全准备好了
I'm fully prepared.

526
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,920
早就蓄势待发了
And I have been for some time.

527
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,890
我知道你会做出你认为最好的决定
I know you'll do whatever you think is best.

528
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,980
但是安德伍德确认了
But Underwood confirmed it.

529
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,670
他将被提名为副总统
He's gonna be tapped for VP.

530
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,650
那对我们一点帮助也没有
That doesn't get us any closer.

531
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,210
我们知道罗素的死给马修斯扫清了障碍
Well, we know that Russo cleared the way for Matthews.

532
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,190
只能印证理论  但不是证据
It reinforces the theory. It doesn't give us proof.

533
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,320
我们不能指责他耍卑鄙手段
We can't go after the guy for playing dirty.

534
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,110
那根本不算新闻
That's not news.

535
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,800
国会里一半的混蛋都在耍手段
Half the fuckers in Congress play dirty.

536
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,890
他扶持一个假候选人  就为到时搞垮他
He propped up a sham candidate, just to take him down.

537
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,350
那天晚上没人强迫罗素喝酒
Nobody forced Russo to drink that night.

538
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,430
那家伙本来就是个酒鬼
The guy was an alcoholic.

539
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,760
好吧  除了三天后他自杀了
Okay, we don't know what happened that night,

540
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,000
关于那晚我们一无所知
other than three days later he killed himself.

541
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,350
你还会再联系他吗
Are you gonna contact him again?

542
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,350
我不知道
I don't know.

543
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,470
我们得放慢进度  退一步重新考虑
We need to slow down, take a step back, and reevaluate.

544
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,080
我们已经让瑞秋溜走了
We already let Rachel slip away.

545
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,580
除非掌握更多信息  否则都是徒劳
There's no point until we have more.

546
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,300
我们应该让他去猜  而不是
We should keep him guessing, not --

547
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,220
等等  从哪里打探更多信息  从谁那里
Wait-- have more from where? From who?

548
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,630
我不知道
I don't know.

549
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,980
但我们应该先尝试别的办法
But we should exhaust all options

550
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,760
-再考虑让佐伊去联系安德伍德  -但我们别无选择
- before Zoe reaches back out to Underwood. - But we don't have any options.

551
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,470
-那会显得我们别无选择  -我们已经撞南墙了
- It looks desperate. - We are up against a brick wall.

552
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,750
除非安德伍德
And unless Underwood--

553
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,170
佐伊
Zoe...?

554
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,340
我需要一个人想想
I just need to think.

555
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,950
大家一起讨论吧
Well, let's think about it together.

556
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,150
明天给你打电话
I'll call you tomorrow.

557
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,130
弗莱迪
Freddy?

558
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,250
怎么了  弗兰克
Yeah, Frank?

559
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,840
今早的肋排是不是有什么不同
Was there something different about these ribs this morning?

560
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,460
更好吃了还是难吃了
Better or worse?

561
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,670
我本以为你的肋排是美味到极致了
I didn't think that they could get any better,

562
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,260
不过今天的真是不同凡响
but these were something special.

563
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,070
换了一个新屠夫
Well, tried a new butcher.

564
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,870
他慢慢地给猪放血
Slow-bleeds his hogs.

565
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,620
这屠宰方法不合法  但是...
It ain't legal, but...

566
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,380
我不会告诉别人的
Well, I won't tell anyone.

567
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,890
我不知道还会不会再去他那里买肉
I don't know if I'm gonna go back to him.

568
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,510
我去他的店
Went out to his shop.

569
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,930
店后有个房间
He's got a room in the back

570
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,020
他就在那里杀猪
where he does it.

571
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,180
房间是隔音的  里面装备齐全
Soundproof. A whole setup.

572
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,010
为什么要弄成隔音的
W-- why soundproof?

573
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,260
因为猪叫得太厉害
'Cause of how they scream.

574
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,530
它们能嗅到死神来临的气息
They can smell it coming.

575
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,970
往它们的喉咙里插根管子
You stick that pipe in their throat,

576
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,430
接下来的十分钟简直生不如死
the next 10 minutes is hell.

577
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,920
你的鼓膜都能被震破
Bust your fucking eardrums.

578
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,480
人性化的方式是速战速决
Now, the humane way to do it is to make it quick.

579
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:03,080
装作喂食那样提一桶泔水来  然后  砰
Bring out a bucket of slop like it's feeding time and -- -- bam.

580
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,620
对准后脑勺来上一锹
Shovel right to the base of the head.

581
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,600
猪一声也不会吭
No screaming.

582
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,050
博奇同意公开竞争  但他说的很清楚
He's willing to open up the race, but Birch was very clear:

583
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,090
如果他不能支持谁  你也不行
if he can't endorse anyone, you can't either.

584
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,290
很公平
That's fair.

585
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,210
你真的希望巴克沃特胜选
You really want Buchwalter to win?

586
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,910
我希望最优秀的人能胜选
I want the best man to win.

587
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,850
谨小慎微的废话  说了等于没说
That sounds like a cagey bullshit non-answer to me.

588
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,110
我不想插手这件事  泰瑞
I'm on the sidelines for this one, Terry.

589
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,210
什么事你不插手  弗兰克
You're never on the sidelines, Frank.

590
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,780
回头见
I'll see you around.

591
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,550
克莱尔  你不回我电话
Claire. You wouldn't return my calls.

592
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,350
我就回来
I'll be back.

593
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:01,910
我的律师说我不应该再和你接触
My attorney said that I shouldn't be in contact with you.

594
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,090
蓝十字会告诉我保险被取消了
Blue Cross said my insurance was canceled.

595
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,090
{\an8}为会员及其家属提供住院等医疗保险的非赢利组织

596
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,330
解雇金条款里规定了一年的健康保险
The severance package gave me health coverage for up to a year.

597
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,980
好像是的
That sounds right.

598
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,470
所以肯定出了什么问题
So there must be some kind of mistake.

599
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,750
你得去跟保险公司说啊
Well, you'll have to talk to the insurance company.

600
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,190
我去了  他们说保险被终止了
I did. They said it was terminated.

601
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,460
如果雇主不同意  他们就无法恢复
They can't reinstate it without the employer's approval.

602
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,360
你想让我帮你一把
And you want me to get involved?

603
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,660
有一些我需要的药物
There's medication that I need

604
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,250
必须通过健康维护组织获取
that I can't get unless it goes through my HMO.

605
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,990
这我知道  我看过你的档案
I'm well aware. I-- I reviewed your records.

606
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,100
-什么  -你签了同意书
- What? - You signed a consent form.

607
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,800
不  我没有
No. I-- I-- I didn't.

608
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,950
你伪造了我的签名吗
You forged my signature?

609
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,380
阿普博姆太太是不是去找过你
Did a Mrs. Applebaum pay you a visit?

610
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,980
你知道你这么做是...
You realize what you're doing is--

611
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,060
民事罪  不是刑事
Civil. Not criminal.

612
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,100
你想清楚了吗  因为等我们上了法庭
Have you thought this out? Because when we go to court--

613
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,560
六个月后吗
You mean six months from now?

614
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,760
你还有四个月就生了  不是吗
You're expecting in four, no?

615
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,750
那么你这四个月就没有药物可用
That's four months without the medicine you need.

616
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,500
如果有必要的话  我宁愿让你的孩子
I'm wiling to let your child wither and die inside you

617
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,010
夭折在你肚子里
if that's what's required.

618
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,090
但我们都不想看到那种结果
But neither of us wants that.

619
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,940
说说看  你真想和我做敌人吗
Now tell me, am I really the sort of enemy you want to make?

620
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,330
但你还有选择
But here's the alternative.

621
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,340
这家机构  这些员工
This office, this staff,

622
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,250
一年两千两百万美元都给你
22 million a year could be yours.

623
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,460
净水计划也是你的
The CWI could be yours.

624
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,200
你我的恩怨一笔勾销
And you and me, we wash our hands of each other.

625
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,100
你想收买我
You're trying to buy me.

626
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,040
不  我们初见时我答应给你权力
No. When we first met, I promised to empower you.

627
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,770
我这是在兑现诺言
I'm fulfilling that promise.

628
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,720
你骗我怎么办
How do I get screwed?

629
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,560
不会的  我辞职  你取代我的职位
You don't. I resign. You take my place.

630
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,340
没其他条件吗
No strings?

631
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,330
没有
None.

632
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,440
民调显示吉姆·马修斯
Exit polls have Jim Matthews winning

633
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,510
将以9到12个百分点的绝对优势赢得竞选
by anywhere from a nine-to-twelve-percent margin of victory.

634
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,480
喂
Hello?

635
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,730
安德伍德太太吗
Mrs. Underwood?

636
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,430
我是
Yes.

637
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,740
你好  这里是拉森医生办公室
Hi. I'm calling from Dr. Larson's office

638
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,690
跟您确认一下明早十点的血检和尿检
to confirm your 10 a.m. tomorrow for the blood and urine tests.

639
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,770
我去不了
I can't come.

640
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,980
如果明天不行
Well, if tomorrow doesn't work,

641
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,620
我们可以重新安排到周四  甚至周一
we can reschedule for Thursday or even Monday--

642
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,000
不  别给我安排了
No, I won't be rescheduling.

643
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,170
请替我感谢拉森医生的会诊
Please tell Dr. Larson I appreciate all her consultation,

644
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,260
但我经过再三考虑
but I've put a great deal of thought into this

645
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,890
决定不再进行其他检测了
and I won't be pursuing any further tests.

646
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,100
谢谢
Thank you.

647
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,690
你考虑过我们之前讨论的事了吗
Have you thought about what we discussed?

648
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,350
你说得没错  我们是该抛开过去  重新开始
I think you're right. We should start with a clean slate.

649
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,960
我们的短信呢
What about our text messages?

650
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,350
还有通讯录
And the contact?

651
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,700
我们之间没事吧
Are we good?

652
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,800
没事
Yeah.

653
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,320
我们忘记这些乱七八糟的事
And we can put all this other nonsense behind us

654
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,220
互相信任  互相帮助  可以吗
and trust one another and continue to help one another?

655
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,580
这样很好
I'd like that.

656
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,630
那现在算是抛开过去了
Then consider the slate clean.

657
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,590
回答我个问题
Answer me one thing.

658
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,580
副驾座的事
The passenger seat.

659
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,830
你说罗素是想出去
You said Russo was trying to get out.

660
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,870
这没什么奇...
That there was nothing ab--

661
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,020
我们不是刚刚说好...
I thought we just agreed to--

662
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,440
我想相信你  但你得说明白
I want to believe you, but I need details.

663
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,890
你有所隐瞒
More than what you're sharing.

664
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,680
你想问什么
What's your question?

665
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,820
罗素酒瘾复发当晚  他出席了一个募捐活动
The night Russo fell off the wagon he was at a fundraiser.

666
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,480
麦克奈利癌症研究所...
The McNeally Cancer Institute--

667
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,070
警察报告里全都有
All in the police report.

668
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,050
瑞秋·波斯纳当晚也在那家酒店
Rachel Posner was at the hotel that night.

669
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,930
那是谁
Who's that?

670
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,250
罗素被捕时跟他在一起的应召女
The call girl who was with Russo when he was arrested.

671
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,760
我又不知道她叫什么
I didn't know her name.

672
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,230
她消失了  弗兰西斯
She disappeared, Francis.

673
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,280
什么时候
When?

674
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,700
别装不知道  我给行李员看了张照片
Don't act surprised. I showed the bellmen a photo.

675
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,820
其中一个记得见过她
One of them remembers seeing her.

676
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,640
她是个妓女
The girl's a prostitute.

677
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,890
她肯定经常出现在各种酒店
I'm sure she frequents many hotels.

678
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,840
可偏巧那晚去那家酒店吗
But that hotel on that night?

679
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,390
你这语气像斯克斯基女士似的
Well, now you sound like Ms. Skorsky talking.

680
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,910
我没和任何人说过这事
I haven't discussed this with anyone.

681
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,940
我想先问你
I wanted to ask you first.

682
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,070
我不知道那晚发生了什么
I have no idea what happened that night,

683
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,170
只知道彼得又开始酗酒
except that Peter started drinking again.

684
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,190
我不知道有谁在场
I don't know who was or wasn't there.

685
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,540
真希望我在
I wish I was.

686
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,160
说不定我能阻止他
Maybe I could have stopped him.

687
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,240
你知道瑞秋在哪吗
Do you know where Rachel is?

688
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,920
相信我的话
Listen to what I am saying.

689
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,840
我是想要保护我们两个人
I am trying to protect us both.

690
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,550
谁都有可能问这些问题
These are questions anyone could ask.

691
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,750
但现在只有你在问
But no one is, except you.

692
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,540
我真不知你想干什么
I can't imagine what you're after.

693
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,180
我冒了个险
I took a chance.

694
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,910
跑去你家  任你摆布
Showed up at your house and placed myself at your feet.

695
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,500
于公于私都跨过了道德底线
Crossed ethical lines, professionally, physically.

696
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,850
我愿意为这些事负责
And I hold myself accountable for that.

697
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,520
这都是我的选择  我愿承担后果
Those were my choices, and I can live with them.

698
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,850
我也希望向前看
I'd like to move forward,

699
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,510
但我需要知道我到底卷入了什么事
but I need to know exactly what I was a part of. That...

700
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,560
我要确定我没有卷入...
that I wasn't a part of someone's...

701
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,280
把话说完
Finish your thought.

702
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,080
一起谋杀
Part of someone's murder.

703
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,060
天哪
Jesus.

704
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,220
我想要相信你  弗兰西斯
I want to believe you, Francis.

705
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,110
我知道你
I know you --

706
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,090
简宁
Janine!

707
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,340
快进来
Come in.

708
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,300
我打不通你电话
I've been calling you.

709
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,570
进屋坐吧
Come in. Sit down.

710
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,590
喝点什么吗
Um, you -- you want something?

711
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,680
水  或者果汁
Some, uh, water or, um, juice?

712
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,350
你要出门
You going somewhere?

713
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,940
你要去哪
Hey. You going somewhere?

714
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,580
去我妈妈那里  在伊萨卡
To my mom's. In Ithaca.

715
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,340
-什么  -我要走了
- What? - I'm leaving.

716
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,650
不不  不行
No. No, no, no. No. No way.

717
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,910
-我们什么都没有  -你要放弃吗
- We have nothing. - Are you giving up on this?

718
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,130
这世上只有三个人知道他干了什么
There are only three people in the world that know what he has done,

719
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,320
其中一个已经死了
and one of them is gone.

720
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,360
如果我们有证据  卢卡斯
If we had anything, Lucas,

721
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,440
任何确凿证据
any hard evidence

722
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,040
哪怕是一个愿意公开的信息源
or even a fucking quote from a source that would go on record for us,

723
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,140
那也好说
that would be one thing.

724
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,950
可我们纯粹在捕风捉影  而他不是闹着玩的
But we are grasping, and he is not fucking around.

725
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,360
是你说服佐伊追查这事的
You were the one who told Zoe to pursue this.

726
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,810
她告诉了我你说的话
She told me what you said.

727
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,570
能把你吓坏的文章才是真正重要的
The only stories that mattered were the ones that scared you to death.

728
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,640
这可不仅仅是死亡威胁
Okay, this isn't just death threats.

729
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,200
这是来真的
This is real.

730
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,180
他不知道你  但他知道我
He doesn't know about you, but he knows about me.

731
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,130
这是在我邮箱里发现的
These were in my mailbox.

732
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,510
没有发信地址
No return address.

733
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,180
他照了她的照片
He took these of her?

734
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,720
还能是谁  你留着吧
Who else? You can keep them.

735
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,920
但我不认为这对你有什么帮助
But I don't think they're gonna help you.

736
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,770
我们必须阻止他
We need to stop him.

737
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,110
变态混蛋
Sick fucking shit.

738
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,620
简宁  你不能就这么逃跑
Janine, you cannot run away from this!

739
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,330
我这一辈子从来都找硬骨头啃
My entire career, I have always chosen the tough stories.

740
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,200
我一向无所畏惧
I have been fearless.

741
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,940
可你猜怎么着
But you know what?

742
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,080
我这回真的害怕极了
I'm really fucking scared this time.

743
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,480
他重权在握
He's got power.

744
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,930
他输不起
He's got a lot to lose.

745
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,210
现在他完全占了上风
And right now he is winning.

746

但我现在什么也没找到

767

这是你必须承担的风险

773

我怎么知道你不是在利用我

为别人竞选制造障碍

就算知道会伤及无辜
And you launched those missiles

786

你还是义无反顾地发射了导弹

没有

我曾亲眼目睹整栋大楼  整个村庄荡然无存
I watched apartment buildings, entire villages gone,

792
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,760

00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,200
如果可以  我不想再谈这个话题了
I'd prefer not to talk about it, if that's all right.

你完成需要完成的任务

幼小  安静  舔着浅盘里的牛奶
