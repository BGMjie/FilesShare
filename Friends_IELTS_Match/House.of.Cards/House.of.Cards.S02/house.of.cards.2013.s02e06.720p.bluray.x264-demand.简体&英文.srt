我们现在面临能源危机  弗兰克
We've got an energy crisis, Frank.

14
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,680
白宫应该...
Now what the White House needs to --

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,210
总统选择对中国保持强硬态度
The president chose to remain tough on China.

16
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,690
不  那是被你逼的
No. You forced him to.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,540
你选择了冯  是你让我和他见面的
You chose Feng. You're the one who put me in a room with him.

18
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,020
厨子手艺不好
The cook can't blame his ingredients

19
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,760
不能去怪原料差
if he doesn't like how they taste together.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,880
如果钐的价格不降
If Samarium prices don't reduce,

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,950
市场只能随之上调电价
the market will have no choice but to compensate.

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,620
那样对每一个使用空调的人来说都是坏消息
That's bad for everyone who owns an air conditioner.

23
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,860
你应该去找总统本人谈谈
You should speak to the president himself.

24
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,280
总统最近不是很重视我的意见
the president hasn't placed much value on my advice lately.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,860
我和你一样  雷蒙德
I'm in the same boat as you, Raymond.

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,570
是啊
Yeah.

27
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,200
不同的是  你和他的办公室只隔三道门
Difference being you've got an office three doors down from the Oval.

28
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,170
我们同心协力吧
Let's work together, for Christ sakes.

29
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,060
只要你愿意  我可以忘记斯波特瑟尔维尼亚的事
I'm wiling to put Spotsylvania behind us if you are.

30
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,740
正合我意
I want nothing more.

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,170
那你会去跟他谈
Then you'll talk to him?

32
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,540
我开会要迟到了  雷蒙德
Look, I'm late for a meeting, Raymond.

33
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,040
答应还是不答应  弗兰克
Yes or no, Frank?

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,760
我不能保证他听得进去
I can't guarantee he'll listen.

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,810
这不是答应
That's not a yes.

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,650
总比不答应强
But it's better than a no.

37
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,830
称职的拳击手都能看出对手什么时候不行了
Any pugilist worth his salt knows when someone's on the ropes,

38
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,230
这时就该果断连续向腹部出拳
that's when you throw a combination to the gut

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,070
左勾拳直击下颚
and a left hook to the jaw.

40
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,600
钐的价格他们绝不会让步
Samarium is the last thing they'll let go of.

41
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,680
只要能源价格一直涨  他们就有谈判筹码
As long as our energy prices rise, they have the leverage.

42
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,650
如果我们只是静观其变呢  跟他们比瞪眼
Why don't we offer nothing? Move toward attrition.

43
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,730
如果中国不参加再融资债券拍卖
If China doesn't show at the refunding auction,

44
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,250
长期利率会一路飙升
long-term interest rates will spike.

45
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,690
一个星期后我们的十年期国债
And in a week yields on our 10-year notes

46
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,500
将突破7%大关
will pierce the seven-percent threshold.

47
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,940
那是有可能
That could happen.

48
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,310
但如果我们现在妥协  那就是必然了
But if we go soft now, that will happen.

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,340
你是说我们应该采取措施
You mean go on the offensive.

50
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,570
至少应该考虑一下
We should at least consider it.

51
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,460
中国人不吃敬酒  我们就上罚酒
The Chinese don't like carrots. Let's see how they like the stick.

52
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,740
怎么做
Well, what might that look like?

53
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,990
增加粮食检查的频率
We could raise inspection rates on foodstuffs.

54
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,560
把他们的粮食扣在港口直到腐烂
Hold them in our ports till they rot.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
提高多少
How much of a raise?

56
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,130
想要有效果要提高20%
20% if we want to draw blood.

57
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,880
用增加抽查次数的方式进行掩饰
Bury the move with increased spot checks all the way around.

58
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,350
这类措施不能解决眼前的问题
These sort of tactics don't solve the immediate problem.

59
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,890
人们现在交着三倍的电费
People are paying triple the standard rate for electric.

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,010
到八月份  就是五倍
We'll hit a five-fold increase by August.

61
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,690
如果您  总统先生  通过行政命令
What if you, Mr. President, by executive order,

62
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,860
从第三方手里购买钐呢
purchase Samarium through a third party?

63
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,310
绕过中国
Cut the Chinese out.

64
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,470
迫使他们提高全球价格
Force them to either raise their prices worldwide

65
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,710
或是降低价格维持跟我们的交易
or lower them to keep direct flow with us.

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,470
当然  对外宣称是为了国防需要进行钐储备
We stockpile Samarium for denfense purposes, of course,

67
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,750
然后悄悄把多余的钐卖给我们核能源方面的盟友
And quietly sell what we don't need to our friends in nuclear energy.

68
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,670
以优惠价格
At a discount.

69
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,640
核能源补助
A subsidy for nuclear power?

70
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,940
有钱人相互接济  这别人会怎么看啊
The richest of the rich? How's that gonna play?

71
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,460
我们正在面对国家危机
We're dealing with a national crisis.

72
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,050
我们不能受公众舆论的影响
We can't get sidetracked with public opinion.

73
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,600
这能让中国知道我们愿意耐心等待
It would show China we're willing to wait this out.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,990
我们有这份钱吗
Do we have the resources?

75
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,410
我要计算一下
I'd have to run the numbers,

76
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,530
预期波动  考虑不同模式
anticipate fluctuations, consider different models --

77
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,650
估计一下
Your best guess.

78
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,480
有  可以进行中度储备
We do. For a moderate stockpile.

79
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,010
那好  以国防部名义起草请求
All right. Draw up a request from the Defense Department.

80
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,190
-是  先生  -琳达  起草行政命令
- Yes, sir.  - Linda, draft the executive order.

81
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,020
凯茜  确保我们能找到一个第三方
And Cathy, make sure we have a third-party conduit

82
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,590
购买钐
to purchase the Samarium.

83
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,990
跟印度买吧
We'll go through India.

84
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,810
那巴基斯坦可要不高兴了
Well, that won't fly well with Pakistan.

85
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,940
我会提前告知他们  只要及时告知他们
I'll alert them in advance. As long as they're in the loop,

86
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,680
就没什么问题  我们又不欠他们什么
we'll be all right. Not that we owe them any favors.

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,940
那好  开始工作吧
All right. Let's get to work.

88
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,210
贝茜  还加上E条款下的三条罪名
Come on, Betsy. Three additional counts under Section E?

89
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,600
三条已经很少了  反映了对犯罪意图的狭义解释
Three is low. It reflects a narrow interpretation of criminal intent.

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,100
你的委托人入侵了数据中心
Your client broke into a data center.

91
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,070
你能提供什么
What's the offer?

92
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,120
我不会认罪的
I'm not doing a plea.

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
让我来处理这个
Let me handle this.

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,390
他们不想开庭审判
They don't want a trial.

95
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,960
我能在公开法庭上高声提出的问题
The questions I'll be raising loud and clear in open court...

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,580
卢卡斯  别这样
Lucas, please.

97
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,910
我们也有问题  古德温先生
We have our own questions, Mr. Goodwin.

98
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,070
比如  你怎么会有这些
For example, what were you doing with these?

99
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,390
这不是我拍的
I didn't take these.

100
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,600
是在你公寓发现的
They were in your apartment.

101
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,520
安德伍德拍的
Underwood took them.

102
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,560
你觉得陪审团能信吗
Do you really expect a jury to believe that?

103
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,420
是他  他们有一腿
He did. They were having an affair --

104
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,640
他们只会如实看待这些证据
Or are they gonna see them for what they are?

105
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,270
你迷恋巴恩斯女士
Proof of our obsession with Ms. Barnes

106
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,270
还编出一套荒唐的阴谋论
and the ludicrous conspiracy you have concocted

107
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,570
来解释她的死
to explain her death.

108
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,150
你们开什么条件
Tell us what you're offering.

109
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,080
你委托人供认以下罪名  E条款下一条
Your client pleads to one count under Section E

110
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,380
闯入数据中心
for breaking into a data center,

111
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,890
欺诈一条  偷《先驱报》的密码
one count for fraud, for stealing the password from the Herald.

112
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,640
第一项获罪10年  第二项10年  同时计算
10 years under Section E. 10 years for fraud. Served concurrently.

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,620
服刑7年可假释
Eligible for parole in seven.

114
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,580
我想单独跟委托人谈谈
I'd like to speak to my client, alone.

115
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,340
请关掉录像录音设备
Cameras and recording equipment off, please.

116
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,010
我介绍总统  他来介绍你
I'll introduce the president, then he'll introduce you.

117
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,390
如果他去  就不能点名军方
If he's there, we can't mention the military.

118
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,380
只能说全国皆有这种现象
Just the endemic problem nationwide.

119
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,650
当然  我理解
Of course. I understand.

120
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,160
好  那再过一遍讲词
Good. So we should go through these speeches

121
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,030
看还有没有...
and make sure that there's nothing --

122
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,180
你好  安德伍德夫人
Hi, Mrs. Underwood.

123
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,320
你好  克里斯蒂娜
Hello, Christina.

124
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,630
沃克夫人  您找我
Mrs. Walker, you asked for me?

125
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,400
我们要确认一下总统能不能
We need to confirm whether the president's going

126
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,480
去新奥尔良
to make it to New Orleans.

127
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,370
是这周五吧
This Friday, correct?

128
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,950
是  但我知道他今早有内阁会议
Yes. But I know he had a cabinet meeting this morning,

129
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,060
所以我想
so I imagine...

130
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,380
我这就去和琳达沟通一下
I'll talk to Linda right away.

131
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,420
谢谢
Thanks.

132
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,730
我知道你希望加勒特去  可能源危机的事
I know you want Garrett there. But with this energy crisis...

133
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,670
不是那个
No. It's not that.

134
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,780
怎么了
What?

135
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,870
我不该说的
I shouldn't say anything.

136
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,380
这下你非说不可了
Well, now you have to tell me.

137
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,260
我就是向来不太喜欢克里斯蒂娜
I've just never been very fond of her. Christina.

138
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,190
为什么
Why not?

139
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,540
彼得·罗素
Peter Russo.

140
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,070
我就是不太喜欢跟老板上床的女人
I just have a thing about women who sleep with their bosses.

141
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,130
不过我相信他们是真心相爱
Anyway, I'm sure whatever they had was genuine.

142
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,380
也不关我事  只要她工作做得好
It's none of my business, 'cause if she's doing a good job,

143
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,970
其他也无所谓
that's all that matters, right?

144
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,940
加勒特还挺满意
Garrett seems to think she is.

145
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,360
那我就不多嘴了
Then I should just keep my feelings to myself.

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,170
如果总统不能去
So if the president is not able to be there,

147
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,700
对咱们或许也是好事
that could be a silver lining for us.

148
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,900
不用给军方留面子了
We won't have to hold back with the military.

149
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,940
电话监听  视频监控  预谋犯罪
Phone taps. Video surveillance. Premeditation.

150
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,900
长期动机  你没希望的
Sustained intent. They've got you cold.

151
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,690
如果我认罪  就没人知道真相了
If I plead out, that's it. No one hears the truth.

152
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,980
你不认罪的话  根本没人会听你的
If you don't plead, no one will hear you, period.

153
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,690
一直到你七八十岁
Not until you're in your 70s.

154
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,200
你和汉默施密特谈了吗
Have you talked to Hammerschmidt yet?

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,820
你没资格谈条件
You're in no position to make demands.

156
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,060
你说了又不算
It's not up to you.

157
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,930
你只会惹恼他们
All you'll do is piss them off.

158
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,260
听我说
Look,

159
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,710
这个交易很好
we've got a good deal here.

160
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,100
考虑到你的行为  算很不错了
A great deal, considering what you did.

161
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,810
趁他们没改主意  赶紧接受
You should take it before their change their mind.

162
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,950
汤姆·汉默施密特
Tom Hammerschmidt.

163
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,880
我要跟他谈  否则就上法庭
I talk to him, or we're going to trial.

164
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,160
请抬起胳膊
Raise your arms, please.

165
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,590
这里有什么物品
You have something here?

166
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,410
项链
My neck chain.

167
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,340
请掏出来
May I see it?

168
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,890
真的吗  我还得解领带
Really? I gotta take off my tie.

169
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,420
必须看一下  先生
I need to see it, sir.

170
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,960
虔诚的基督徒啊  雷米
You're a good Christian, Remy.

171
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,810
我母亲的  是她虔诚
My mother's. She was the good Christian.

172
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,870
那你也是个好儿子
Well, then you're just the good son.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,030
谢谢
Thank you, sir.

174
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,460
外面热吧
Hot out there, huh?

175
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,300
35.5度  车里显示的
96, according to my car.

176
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,000
以前在加夫尼也这么热
We had heat like that back in Gaffney,

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,110
那会儿还没有空调
but we didn't know what air conditioning was,

178
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,530
我们认为夏天就该这么难熬
so we just accepted as fact that summer was meant to be miserable.

179
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,310
加不加水
Neat or with water?

180
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,200
只要水  不要酒
Just the water. You can hold the bourbon.

181
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,160
得找个解决办法
We need to find a solution

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,060
好让这个夏天美国人民不那么难熬
so that this one isn't miserable for 300 million people.

183
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,660
我有办法了
I already have found a solution.

184
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,650
得了吧  弗兰克  钐补助吗
Oh, please, Frank. A Samarium subsidy?

185
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,630
是你还是雷蒙德表示怀疑
Is that your skepticism or Raymond's?

186
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,280
我  估计他也是
Mine. Anticipating his.

187
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,820
你俩还没谈过
So you haven't spoken to him yet.

188
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,620
我想向他提出他会同意的条件
I want to offer him something he can agree to.

189
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,090
他没什么选择
Well, he doesn't have much of a choice.

190
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,990
你为什么要把他逼入绝境
Why are you cornering him?

191
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,600
我把价钱减半  这是在帮他啊
I'm cutting the rate by half. I'd call that liberating him.

192
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,980
你知道他可不这么看
You know that's not how he'll see it.

193
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,900
这场贸易战让北京方面
This trade war is preventing the refinery

194
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,970
迟迟不批准精炼厂项目
from being approved in Beijing.

195
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,420
目前  他跟冯的合资项目不是最重要的
His co-venture with Feng is not our highest priority right now.

196
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,690
稀土精炼厂能一劳永逸地解决这场危机
A rare earth refinery solves this crisis permanently.

197
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,480
那是三年之后了  这个夏天还是难熬
Three years from now. Not this summer.

198
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,790
不止如此  实施核能补助他至多不赔不赚
It's not just that. With the subsidy he'll break even at best,

199
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,420
那叫做生意吗
there's no point in doing business to hover between red and black.

200
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,940
雷蒙德的利益对我来说比他的合资项目更不重要
Raymond's profits are an even lower priority to me than his co-venture.

201
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,000
告诉我你的目的  弗兰克
Tell me what you're up to, Frank.

202
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,310
你跟塔斯克叫劲又得不到什么
There's nothing to gain by locking horn with Tusk.

203
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,280
问你的客户去  是塔斯克在叫劲
Ask your client. It's Tusk who's locking the horns.

204
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,010
他不喜欢矛盾
He's not a man who likes conflict.

205
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,990
我也不喜欢
Neither am I.

206
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,070
那就提出要求吧  我知道你不在乎核能补助
Then make the ask. 'Cause I know you don't care about the subsidy.

207
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,620
你有更大的目标
This is about something bigger.

208
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,310
我是个虔诚的基督徒  雷米  跟你母亲一样
I'm a good Christian, Remy, like your mother.

209
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,840
如果我想要别的  我会如实说的
I would tell you the truth if I wanted more.

210
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,400
你这是在发出信号吗
You trying to send a message?

211
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,340
也许吧
Perhaps.

212
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,230
那内容是什么
Which is?

213
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,440
顽固比顺从的代价更大
That stubbornness is far more costly than obedience.

214
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,770
谢谢你的水
Thanks for the water.

215
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,670
你站错队了  雷米
You're on the wrong side, Remy.

216
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,830
是啊  我们中肯定有一人站错
Yeah, well, one of us sure is.

217
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,370
大黄蜂飞回家后
And when the bumblebee flew home,

218
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,610
发现它的朋友们都抱着大桶蜂蜜在等他
all his friends were waiting with buckets honey, right?

219
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,080
他的朋友有蠕虫  老鼠
And he's got his worm friend and his mouse friend

220
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,390
蜘蛛和蜗牛
and his spider friend and his snail friend.

221
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,280
它们都有许多蜂蜜  他看上去开心多了  是吗
And they all had tons of honey. And he looks happier now, right?

222
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,360
-是啊  -是吗
- Yeah! - Yeah?

223
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,930
于是他们开心地嗡嗡叫了起来
And so they all buzzzzed with happiness.

224
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,020
因为和朋友们在一起  生活会甜蜜得多
Because life is sweet when you spend it with your friend.

225
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,020
对吗
Right?

226
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,700
你们会振动翅膀发出嗡鸣声吗  扇动小翅膀吧
Can you all buzz your wings? Buzz your little wings.

227
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,520
-我觉得会发出颤动的声音  就像  -就像
- I think it would make a fluttering noise, like... - like

228
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,280
我不知道
I don't know.

229
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,380
你的颤动呢
Your flutters?

230
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,960
外面太热了  你不该抛球  弗兰西斯
It's too hot out here for you to be doing this, Francis.

231
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,500
我一直在喝水
I'm keeping hydrated.

232
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,930
这距离满足规定吗
Is that even regulation?

233
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,480
只到一半
It's only half.

234
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,350
但我不想让媒体看到我在大街上练习
But I don't want the press to see practicing on the street.

235
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,710
还记得你在格林维尔开球那次吗
You remember when you threw out that first pitch in Greenville?

236
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,000
我还在想你什么时候会提到那事呢
I was wondering how long it was gonna take you to bring that up.

237
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,120
那次还不是全国电视台直播呢
That wasn't even on national television.

238
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,470
祝你好运
Good luck.

239
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,770
谢谢
Thank you.

240
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,000
格林维尔发生了什么
What happened in Greenville?

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,010
格林维尔驱动队
The Greenville Drive.

242
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,220
红袜队的1A队
Single A team for the Red Sox.

243
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,650
主场作战  我站在投球区土墩上
It was a home game. I get on the mound.

244
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,690
你从土墩上抛球吗
You threw from the mound?

245
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,450
我想投个好球
Well, I wanted to throw a real pitch.

246
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,350
没抛好吗
Didn't make it.

247
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,790
差得远呢
Not even close.

248
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,850
一半吗
Halfway?

249
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,270
球在我松手前滑了出去
Ball slipped out of my hand just before I released it.

250
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,200
直线抛上了天
Went straight up in the air.

251
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,000
掉下来砸在我头上  全场爆发大笑
Hit me on top of the head. The whole stadium burst a gut laughing.

252
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,980
喜剧性投球
Comic relief pitcher.

253
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,980
真会说话  密查姆
That's very clever, Meechum.

254
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,490
别告诉克莱尔
Don't tell Claire.

255
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,130
我听到了
I heard that.

256
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,260
你跟他们处得真好
You're really good with them.

257
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,860
他们作手指画时  你看到罗比了吗
Did you see Robbie when they were finger-painting?

258
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,660
他脱掉了裤子  把他自己涂成蓝色
He pulled down his pants and started painting himself blue.

259
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,630
-没看到  -真的
- No. - Yeah.

260
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,860
但愿我都洗干净了
Hope I got it all off.

261
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,490
艾利克斯和达利尔不会在意的
I'm sure Alex and Daria don't care.

262
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,390
他们总是让他光着身子四处跑
They let him run around naked all the time.

263
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,550
是啊  但不会像光屁股的蓝精灵
Yeah, but probably not with his Smurf ass.

264
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,880
我们今晚吃什么
What do we want to do for dinner tonight?

265
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
我还有一些吃剩的鸡肉  或者我们可以叫披萨
I've got some leftover chicken. Or we could order pizza.

266
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,280
披萨  不做菜
Pizza. No dishes.

267
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,380
是啊
Yeah.

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,380
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

269
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,510
我完全忘了有个朋友今晚要来接我
I -- I totally forgot I've got a friend picking me up tonight.

270
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,140
我完全忘了
I -- I completely blanked.

271
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,980
-没事  -我真的很抱歉
- That's fine. - I'm really sorry.

272
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,340
不必道歉  是你男朋友吗
Don't sweat it. Is it, uh, your boyfriend?

273
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,340
不是  只是一个老朋友
No, no. Um, just an old friend.

274
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,290
我能见见他吗
Can I meet him?

275
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,520
他有点害羞  我不知道他是否愿意
he's kinda shy. I do-- I don't know if he'd be up for --

276
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,260
没事  没关系
Totally cool. Don't worry about it.

277
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,970
我们改天再一起吃晚饭
We'll just do dinner another night.

278
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,130
明天见
I'll see you tomorrow.

279
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,130
好  你知道去哪里找我
Yeah. You know where I'll be.

280
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,010
多久了
How long?

281
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,180
几个月了
Couple of months.

282
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,810
为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

283
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,730
我不能去教堂吗
I can't go to church?

284
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,550
你跟任何人有接触都可能暴露我们
Anywhere you interact with other people opens us up to risk.

285
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,440
那我就该整天闷在呼叫中心
Right. I'm just supposed to slave away at the fucking call center

286
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,010
或是待在公寓里不出来吗
and then lock myself in the apartment.

287
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,030
别这么小题大做
Don't get dramatic.

288
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,390
我喜欢这些人
I like the fellowship.

289
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,470
好吗  没有什么可担心的
Okay? There -- there's nothing to worry about there.

290
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,510
如果谁林奇堡的亲戚来访就能毁了一切
All it takes is one person's cousin to visit from Lynchburg.

291
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,520
或许是你的高中同学
Someone you went to high school with

292
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,480
或许是曾跟你共度良宵的客户
or some client that you spend the night with.

293
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,930
那些人才不会出现在这里
Those guys would never end up here.

294
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,920
你怎么知道
You don't know that.

295
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,060
我就是知道
Yeah. I do.

296
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,740
你不就跑来这里了吗
You ended up here, didn't you?

297
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,040
我不能这么生活
I can't live like this.

298
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,730
什么
What?

299
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,070
我不能这么生活
I can't live like this.

300
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,970
不  你能  你是个坚强的姑娘
Yes, you can. You're a strong girl.

301
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,260
就这些  这就是全部了吗
That's it? That's everything?

302
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,320
我知道  你以前就听过了
I know. You've heard it before.

303
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,960
作为一个朋友  卢卡斯  而不是记者
As a friend, Lucas. Not as a reporter.

304
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,420
我会接着挖
Now I dig.

305
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,300
我去打电话  去跑腿
I make the phone calls. I do the legwork.

306
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,810
他们对你还好吗
They treating you okay?

307
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,860
还行
It's fine.

308
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,440
我不是问那个
That's not what I asked.

309
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,680
他们非常想达成认罪协议
They're pushing the plea deal pretty hard.

310
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,470
你在认真考虑吗
How seriously are you considering it?

311
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,830
我想看看文章的影响
I want to see how this article impacts things.

312
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,850
你的律师怎么说
What does your lawyer say?

313
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,890
他觉得这是个坏主意  我应该认罪
He thinks that's a bad idea. That I should take the plea.

314
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,230
也许你应该听他的
Maybe you should listen to him.

315
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,840
不  我要文章  我确定
No. I want the article. That I'm certain of.

316
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,030
好吧  那我得赶快开始了
All right. I better get to it then.

317
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,160
谢谢你
Thank you.

318
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,400
你要知道
You need to know,

319
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,230
我会像对待其他报道一样对待这件事
I'm gonna treat this the way I would any other story.

320
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,740
报道事实  你也许不会喜欢我写的东西
Whatever the facts bear. You might not like what I write.

321
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,940
我明白
I get that.

322
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,960
我会先让你看  然后你再做决定
I'll let you read it first. Then you can decide.

323
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,330
我就是这意思
That's all I'm asking.

324
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,950
挺住
Hang in there.

325
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,500
能帮我擦掉吗  求你了
Can you wipe this off? Please?

326
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,860
其他核供应商都赞同吗
And the other nuclear providers are on board?

327
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,410
大部分  除了雷蒙德的公司
Most. Except Raymond's company.

328
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,390
还有几个
Couple of others.

329
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,090
湖港核电站  狼泉集团
Lakeport Nuclear. Wolf Springs.

330
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,120
我无法证明  但我敢肯定他们是串通好的
Now, I can't prove it, but I am absolutely sure they're colluding.

331
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,900
雷蒙德想让我丢脸
Raymond wants to embarrass me.

332
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,540
我提出方案  核能说客却不肯合作
I offer a solution, nuclear lobby turns its back.

333
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,680
他有拒绝的权利  总统先生
He has the right to refuse, Mr. President.

334
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,460
但他没法操纵能源市场
What he cannot do is manipulate the energy market.

335
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,330
你想对经销方施压
You want to put pressure on the distribution side.

336
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,290
不仅施压  彻底禁止纵向合并
More than pressure. Ban vertical integration entirely.

337
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,920
我们没有那个管制权力
We don't have that regulatory power.

338
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,900
我们给《紧急能源法案》加一条反垄断协议
We add an antitrust agreement to the Emergency Energy Bill.

339
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,770
我们打破地区性供应和经销垄断
We break up the regional supply and distribution monopolies,

340
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,390
就像当年对贝尔系统那样
like the Bell System.

341
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,390
{\an8}1984年  司法部结束了贝尔公司对电话服务的垄断  将一个大公司拆分为独立小公司

342
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,290
那马上就会引起官司
It'll be challenged immediately in the courts.

343
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,970
我们不需要协议通过  只是用来吓唬人
We don't need it to pass. We just need to threaten it.

344
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,430
看他会不会屈服
See if he falls into line.

345
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,470
这事能不能低调办妥  不闹上新闻
Is there a way to do that without it making its way into the news?

346
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,010
我不希望世界上最有钱的有钱人都给我打电话
I don't want the world's wealthiest one percent on my phone sheet.

347
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,690
当然可以  先生
There is absolutely a way to do that, sir.

348
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,050
你们的酒来了
Here you go.

349
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,620
周二晚上就这么热闹
Crowded for a Tuesday night.

350
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,220
我们把室温保持在18度  而且免费
We keep it at 65 degrees. And it's free.

351
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,800
一杯伏特加苏打水18块也叫免费吗
If you call 18 bucks for a vodka soda free.

352
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,730
那也比电力公司的账单便宜
Still cheaper than a Pepco bill.

353
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,220
那要看你喝多少了
Depends on how many you have?

354
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,750
你想让我们喝醉吗
You trying to get us drunk?

355
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,520
你喝得越醉  给的小费越多
Drunker you are, bigger your tip.

356
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,110
我不用喝醉就会好好答谢优质服务
I don't have to be drunk to appreciate good service.

357
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,170
我去找零钱
I'll get your change.

358
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,410
不用了
No, you won't.

359
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,760
谢谢你
Thank you.

360
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,000
你真不要脸
You're shameless.

361
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,210
所以我是个好说客  干杯
Makes me a good lobbyist. Cheers.

362
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,920
杰姬  举动很大胆  但是没用的
So, Jackie, bold move, but it won't work.

363
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,160
你知道我们可以轻松通过这项修正案
You know we can pass this amendment in a heartbeat.

364
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,730
也许  但没有人会遵守
Maybe. But no one'll comply.

365
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,670
它会被推翻  最后竹篮打水一场空
It'll get overturned. Big fuss for nothing.

366
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,760
也许会被推翻  但依然会留下印记
It might get overturned. But it gets ink along the way.

367
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,050
以我对雷蒙德·塔斯克的了解
One thing I learned about Raymond Tusk

368
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,390
他才不在乎什么公众意见
is he doesn't two bird shits about public opinion.

369
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,110
他的股东们在乎
His stockholders do.

370
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,160
只要他一句话
They'd jump in a pit of snakes

371
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
他们就会跳进蛇窝  把自己点着
and light themselves on fire if he gave the word.

372
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,800
我只求你能转达我们的意图
All I'm asking if that you convey our intentions.

373
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,420
为什么找我  弗兰克打个电话还不容易
Why me? Frank could easily pick up the phone.

374
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,100
你还叫他弗兰克呢
You still call him Frank?

375
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,170
不会当面叫  我也尽量避免见他
Not to his face, which I try to keep to a minimum.

376
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,220
你不觉得在白宫有个能说上话的人很好吗
Don't you appreciate having an ear in the White House?

377
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,170
如果真是那样还好了  但最近我净听他说了
I wouldn't, if I had an ear. But lately all I've got is a mouth.

378
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,280
是啊  他不是很善于倾听  对吧
Yeah. He's not the best listener, is he?

379
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,690
你要是为他工作就知道了
Try working for him.

380
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,050
你曾在他手下干过吗
You were on his staff?

381
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,230
八年  新闻发言人  那时你还没进国会
Eight years. Press secretary. Before you joined Congress.

382
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,270
这倒说明了很多问题
That explains a lot.

383
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,490
比如什么
Like what?

384
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,820
比如很多
Like a lot.

385
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,570
我就当你是在羞辱我了
I'll take that as an insult.

386
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,620
没错
You should.

387
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,830
这就走吗  这就撇下我吗
That's it? You're abandoning me?

388
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,350
不  我去买下一轮
No. I'm buying the next round.

389
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,550
礼尚往来嘛
I can't accept gifts from lobbyists without reciprocating.

390
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,280
而且我是个好帮手  
Plus, I'm a good wingman.

391
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,700
这样你能多跟那个酒吧女侍接触
This gets you more face time with the barmaid.

392
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,060
你都做好了吗
You already got 'em ready?

393
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,300
你的手下通知我你要来了
Your guys gave me the heads-up you were coming.

394
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,490
希望他们没有太早吵醒你
Well, I hope that they didn't wake you earlier than usual.

395
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,750
操  这么热我哪能睡得着
Fuck, man. With this heat I ain't sleeping much anyway.

396
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,600
怎么  家里没有空调吗
What? No AC at home?

397
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,630
我有空调  只是不想付账单
Oh, I got a unit. I just don't want to pay the damn bill.

398
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,470
总的来说  这里的温度还可以
It's not too bad in here, all things considered.

399
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,000
那是因为我们在阴凉处
That's 'cause we in the shade.

400
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,740
过两小时  你要是去外面人行道上
When you get outside a couple hours from now on that pavement,

401
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,120
滚烫的地面能把你的鸡巴烤熟
fry your damn dick off from three feet below.

402
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,940
烧烤架那边一定很难熬
Must be bad over that grill.

403
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,600
我都觉不出区别了
I can't tell the difference no more.

404
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,890
但是我跟你说
I tell you what, though.

405
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,770
气温超过37度  这里的情况就会变糟
Stuff goes down aroundhere when the mercury pop a hundred.

406
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,350
之前在家里打老婆的男人会到街上来打
Man who beat his wife at home will beat her right out on the street.

407
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,090
把我们的兽性都暴露出来了
Brings out the animal in us.

408
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,550
可不是开玩笑
It ain't no joke.

409
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,560
以前我会被什么惊醒  枪声
What used to wake me up? Gunshots.

410
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,280
你知道现在是什么吗  人们操的声音
Now you know what does? People fucking.

411
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,680
又是呻吟又是尖叫  像巷子里的猫
Moaning and screaming like god damn cats in the alley.

412
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,190
俗话说得好  天热一身汗
You know what they say: When you get hot and sweaty,

413
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,960
脱衣就开干
it make you ripe and ready.

414
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,520
我喝多了
I drank too much.

415
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,760
我们都喝多了
We both did.

416
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,850
昨晚的事没发生
Last night didn't happen.

417
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,740
我知道
I know.

418
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,460
我出门之后  一切公事公办
When I walk out that door, it's business as usual.

419
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,750
没有特殊优待
No special treatment.

420
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,940
别担心  你不需要申请禁制令
Don't worry. You won't need a restraining order.

421
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,510
我很惊讶  你没去找那个女招待
I'm surprised you didn't go for the waitress.

422
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,650
你比她性感得多
You're much sexier.

423
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,800
得了吧
Yeah, okay.

424
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,810
她为小费工作  而你运作国会
She works for tips. You run Congress.

425
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,260
只有一半
Only half of it.

426
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,830
那也比她厉害得多
That's half more than she does.

427
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,760
那么不是我的身体吸引你
So it's not my body.

428
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,570
那双腿还是挺不错的
Those legs don't hurt.

429
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,990
你真是满口胡言
You're so full of shit.

430
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,480
好吧  是你的声音
Okay. It's your voice.

431
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,350
我的声音
My voice?

432
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,530
让我欲罢不能
It does something to me.

433
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,600
把塔斯克的意思转达给我
Let me know what Tusk has to say.

434
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,610
不谈公事  你还没出门呢
Business hasn't started. You haven't walked out that door yet.

435
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,790
看好了
Watch me.

436
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,950
谢谢你  杰姬
Thank you, Jackie.

437
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,860
我们去白宫
We're going to the White House.

438
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,980
小约翰在移动
Little John on the move.

439
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,960
我们提高赌注  把联邦能源管理委员会拉进来
We raise the bet. We get FERC involved.

440
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,810
调查吗
An investigation?

441
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,530
我们不需要国会来调用能源委员会
We don't need Congress to activate the Regulatory Commission.

442
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,550
但是价格听证  会耗费好几个月
But a price-fixing review? That would take months.

443
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,770
再说一次  只是威胁  不是真的
Again, it's the threat. Not the actuality.

444
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,710
他会采用同样的对策
He'll employ the same logic.

445
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,530
把这事拿到法庭上去
Draw it out. Fight back with appeals.

446
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,640
但如果联邦能源管理委员会开始行动
But he'll have to divulge his accounting

447
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,630
他的账目就会曝光
if FERC takes action.

448
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,200
没有哪个生意人愿意公开账目
Now, no businessman wants to open up his books,

449
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,700
尤其是四百三十亿的账目
especially one with $43 billion.

450
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,310
这事开始失控了  弗兰克
This is getting outta hand, Frank.

451
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,530
我们不应该跟雷蒙德对着干
We shouldn't be duking it out with Raymond.

452
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,810
也许我们该和他谈谈
Maybe we should talk to him.

453
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,030
这正是他想要的  让自己回到圈里来
That's exactly what he wants. To force himself back into the mix.

454
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,960
把他排除在外有什么好处呢
What's to be gained by shutting him out?

455
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,590
给他个教训  让他知道
The simple lesson that you cannot strong-arm

456
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,010
他不能强迫美国总统
the president of the United States.

457
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,120
我们不能沦落到跟他斗气
We can't devolve to a pissing contest.

458
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,440
我要给雷蒙德打电话  邀他来华盛顿
I'm gonna call Raymond. Invite him to Washington.

459
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,520
除非您彻底投降  否则他不会接受
He won't accept anything but total surrender.

460
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,370
我这就打电话
I'm making the call.

461
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,550
别把自己逼到那个地步
Don't put yourself in that position.

462
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,870
我知道如何维护政府的尊严  谢谢你
I know how to maintain the integrity of my office. Thank you.

463
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,330
谢谢您  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

464
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,240
只要跟总统待两分钟
Two minutes with the president,

465
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,310
塔斯克就能再获青睐
and Tusk may be back in his good graces.

466
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,570
我要阻止他们再度联手
I need to disrupt the nuptials and prevent a second marriage.

467
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,690
克里斯蒂娜
Christina?

468
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,840
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

469
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,560
拜托  你看上去棒极了
Please. You look great.

470
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,020
谢谢你
Thank you.

471
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,320
最近怎么样
How are things?

472
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,830
很好  琳达让我忙得脚不着地
Great. Linda works me to the bone,

473
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,360
但这就是我想要的
but that's what I signed up for.

474
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,610
据我所知  你干得很不错
Well, from what I've heard, you're doing a great job.

475
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,160
很高兴能听到这样的评价
Oh, that's really nice to hear.

476
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,810
我想跟你谈谈特莉莎
Look, I wanted to talk to you about Tricia.

477
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,100
你肯定注意到她仍在适应自己的角色
I'm sure you've noticed that she's still sort of adjusting to her role.

478
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,560
你是说自信方面吗
You mean her confidence?

479
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,840
我觉得你应该主动去找她谈
I think it would be great if you reached out to her.

480
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,660
让她知道如果有什么需要你会帮助她
Just let her know that you're there if there's anything that she needs.

481
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,450
我其实跟她不熟  我们见过  但是我
I don't really know her that well. I mean, we've met, but I...

482
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,540
没关系
That's okay.

483
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,570
或者就告诉她  你很喜欢为总统工作
Maybe just tell her that you enjoy working for the president

484
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,540
你愿意尽你所能帮助她
and you're there to be of help to her in any way you can.

485
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,860
-你不觉得那样有点唐突吗  -没有
- You don't think that's a little -- I don't know -- brash? - No.

486
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,310
我就这么去找她
For me to just approach her like that?

487
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,260
不会的
No. Not at all.

488
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,430
你已接通斯克斯基宅
You've reached the Skorsky residence.

489
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,290
请在哔声后留言
Leave a message after the beep.

490
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,230
又是汤姆·汉默施密特  还是要找简宁
Tom Hammerschmidt again. Still trying to reach Janine.

491
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,630
还是重要的事  谢谢
Still important. Thank you.

492
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,640
汉默施密特整天都在往我们新闻处打电话
Hammerschmidt's been calling our press office all day.

493
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,880
我跟你一样不希望闹出任何新闻
I don't want a story to come out any more than you do.

494
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,810
否则我们会损失一名重要线人
We lose a major asset if it does.

495
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,240
你能以安保理由让他噤声吗
Can you squash it for security reasons?

496
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,810
一旦让媒体知道就不行了  第一修正案什么的
Not once it's been shared with the press. First Amendment crap.

497
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,050
牢房并没能解决问题
Ward isn't making things any easier.

498
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,900
她想邀个大功
She wants a notch in her belt.

499
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,290
我们给她一个机会了
We're giving her one.

500
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,990
不是古德温  她想要奥尔西
Not Goodwin. She wants Orsay.

501
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,100
六年的首要通缉犯
Most Wanted list for six years.

502
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,050
我来搞定汉默施密特
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

503
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,710
你得确保古德温认罪
You need to make sure Goodwin takes the plea.

504
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,650
35年刑期  不许假释
If 35 with no parole doesn't scare the piss out of him,

505
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,940
绝对能吓倒他
I don't know what will.

506
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,430
别去吓唬他
Then don't try to scare him.

507
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,880
让他彻底绝望
Remove hope from equation.

508
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,370
我努力控制这件事
I tried to keep this contained.

509
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,780
我没预料到汉默施密特会出现
I didn't anticipate Hammerschmidt.

510
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,020
斯克斯基女士在跟他合作吗
Is Ms. Skorsky cooperating with him?

511
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,230
他给她打过电话
He's called her.

512
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,820
我在联调局的朋友说他们没交谈过
My guy at the bureau said they haven't actually spoken.

513
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,180
至少没在电话里交谈过
At least not on the phone.

514
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
如果闹上法庭
If this goes to court...

515
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,150
不会的  先生
That won't happen, sir.

516
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,770
要是他发表了文章就会
It will if he publishes.

517
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,910
我来找你是因为我无法控制汉默施密特
I'm bringing this to you because I can't control Hammerschmidt.

518
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,150
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

519
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,200
我们要发动正面进攻  然后守住阵线
We need to invite a full-frontal attack. Then hold the line.

520
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,790
你要跟他谈谈吗
You want to speak to him?

521
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,320
面对面  只有我们俩
Face to face. Just the two of us.

522
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,940
我觉得那不是个好主意  先生
I don't think that's a good idea, sir.

523
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,520
你有更好的主意吗
You have a better idea?

524
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,390
没有  先生
No, sir.

525
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,460
我们无法避免战争  但我们可以选择战场
We can't avoid the battle, but we can choose the battlefield.

526
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,010
把会面安排在白宫
Set up a meeting at the White House.

527
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,080
摆架子吓唬他
We'll intimidate him with formality.

528
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,070
是  先生
Yes, sir.

529
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,700
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President?

530
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,800
我知道你没有耐心听道歉
I know you don't have patience for apologies,

531
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,060
但我很抱歉让你失望了
but I'm sorry if I've let you down in any way.

532
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,010
我们集中精神解决眼前问题吧
Let's concentrate on what's in front of us.

533
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,170
我安排好之后会告诉你的
I'll let you know when I have a time set up.

534
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,950
-越快越好  -是  先生
- Soon as possible. - Yes, sir.

535
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,370
这算是长篇报道的概述吗
So this is a sort of outline to the larger piece?

536
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,290
问题都在下一页
With questions on the next page.

537
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,320
我们现在是私下谈话
We're off the record.

538
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,190
对  私下谈话
Yes. Off the record.

539
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,180
汤姆  我知道你关心这个年轻人
Now, Tom, I know that you care about this young man,

540
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,610
我也尊重你的职业精神
and I respect you as a journalist.

541
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,150
但这些问题
But these questions?

542
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,330
你怎么不直接问我
Why don't you just ask me

543
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,990
为什么不再掐死别人的宠物了
when I stopped strangling people's pets.

544
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,610
先生  罗素议员的死
Sir, the death of Congressman Russo --

545
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,420
你是说我的朋友  彼得·罗素
You mean my friend, Peter Russo,

546
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,170
他的自杀让两个年幼的孩子失去了父亲
whose suicide left two small children with no father.

547
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,860
不  我不会回答关于那事的问题
No, I will not answer questions about that.

548
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,490
你好  我知道  不  告诉她我待会儿回电
Yes? I'm aware of that. No. Tell her I'll call her right back.

549
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,240
给你两分钟  刚刚是杜兰特国务卿
Two minutes. Secretary Durant.

550
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,460
我可以在外面等你给她回电
I can wait outside for you to call her back --

551
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
不  我们说完
No, let's finish.

552
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,090
那么
Now,

553
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,960
如果你打算发表这些内容
if you decide to print any of this,

554
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,440
如果你真能找到愿意发表的出版机构
assuming you find an outlet that's willing to,

555
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,670
那么  确实会让我头疼一阵
then, yes, it might cause me a headache for a day.

556
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,310
但我不会做出回应
But I will not engage.

557
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,410
在我看来  报道只会更加突出
And I think it will only prove to highlight

558
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,230
古德温先生的论断多么可笑  我同情他
how ridiculous Mr. Goodwin's claims are. I pity him.

559
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,430
真心的  我觉得他需要帮助
I truly do. I think he needs help.

560
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,730
我采访过很多精神异常的人  他没疯
I've interviewed many mentally ill people. He's not one of them.

561
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,260
我建议你把自己的文章再好好读读
Well, I would suggest that you read your own article again.

562
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,590
他只是非常痛苦  这两者是有区别的
He's distressed. There's a difference.

563
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,980
我理解  看到他入狱对你打击一定很大
Look, I understand. It must be a terrible blow to see him in prison.

564
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,600
但汤姆
But, Tom...

565
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,030
瑞秋·波斯纳确有其人
Rachel Posner exists.

566
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,270
我找不到她  但我已经证实她不是捏造的
I haven't been able to find her, but I've proven she's not a fantasy.

567
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,700
罗伊·科佩尼科也是  这些人确实存在
The same goes for Roy Kapeniak. These people were born.

568
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,120
他们有社保号码  既往住址...
They have social security numbers, past addresses, past --

569
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,090
全美各地的每个人都是如此
And so does everyone from California to Maine.

570
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,830
我和他们都有共谋吗
Have I conspired with all of them?

571
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,030
你得承认  酒驾问题确实有些解释不清的细节
You have to admit there are some troubling details regarding the DUI.

572
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,490
要知道  人们也是这么说51区的
You know, people say the same thing about Area 51.

573
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,490
{\an8}有很多军事及外星人传闻的地区  美国政府对此既不肯定也不否认

574
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,830
你可以尽情想象
You can conjure up little gray men if you really want to.

575
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,610
你杀了彼得·罗素吗
Did you kill Peter Russo?

576
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,210
汤姆  你这就是自找没趣了
Tom, you're embarrassing yourself.

577
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,180
你杀了佐伊·巴恩斯吗
Did you kill Zoe Barnes?

578
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,340
这些荒唐事根本不值得我浪费这么多时间
I've given you more time than this nonsense deserves.

579
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,470
我必须得问
I have to ask these questions.

580
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,170
要我提问的话  我只问一句
Well, the only question I would ask is

581
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,530
这样的报道对古德温先生有利还是有害
does this sort of article hurt or help Mr. Goodwin?

582
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,070
你得做你认为对的事
You have to do what you think is -- is right.

583
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,450
但我希望你能理解
But I hope you can understand

584
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,130
我无法认真对待这些问题  有损我的身份
if I don't demean myself by taking any of it seriously.

585
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,860
感谢您抽出时间  副总统先生
I appreciate your time, Mr. Vice President.

586
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,870
怎么样
How did it go?

587
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,530
我的任务完成了  把这事了结了吧  道格
I did my part. Now put it to bed, Doug.

588
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,230
我不会允许自己再面对这样的处境
I won't submit myself to this sort of exposure again.

589
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:45,810
是  先生
Yes, sir.

590
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,700
塔斯克和总统见面了吗
Has Tusk met with the president yet?

591
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,170
琳达说他们约了四点半
Linda said they're meeting at 4:30.

592
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,440
联系雷米  确保他上飞机前我能见他一面
Call Remy. Make sure he doesn't get on his plane before I see him.

593
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,460
这就去办
I'm on it.

594
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,630
沃克夫人
Oh, Mrs. Walker?

595
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,840
我只想说  我非常荣幸
I just wanted to say how rewarding it's been,

596
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,990
能在白宫西楼工作
working here in the West Wing.

597
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,770
为您丈夫工作  我很自豪
And I'm so proud to be working for your husband.

598
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,520
谢谢  我知道他赏识你的勤奋
Thank you. I know he appreciates all your hard work.

599
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,240
既然我现在在他身边工作
Well, now that I'm working so closely with him,

600
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,170
如果有什么我能帮到您的
if there's anything I can do for you,

601
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,220
任何能帮您或他减轻负担的事...
anything that would make yours or his life easier...

602
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,380
继续做好你的工作就行
Just keep doing what you're doing.

603
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,810
我是真心的  您别客气
Truly, anything.

604
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,660
我想让您知道  你们可以依靠我
I want you to know you can rely on me. Both of you.

605
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,990
我知道  谢谢  克里斯蒂娜
I know that. Thank you, Christina.

606
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,310
谢谢  沃克夫人
Thanks, Mrs. Walker.

607
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,750
-让我来  -没事  我手不太听使唤
- Oh, here. Let me. - Oh, it's just my hands.

608
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,260
-很难受吗  -是啊  今晚估计要下雨
- Are they bothering you? - Yeah. Probably gonna get rain tonight.

609
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,900
我去开门
I'll get it.

610
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,070
不用  继续搅拌肉汤就行
Um, no. Just, uh, keep the broth moving.

611
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,880
我是联调局的格林特工
Agent Green, FBI.

612
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,310
有空吗  斯克斯基女士
Do you have a moment, Ms. Skorsky?

613
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,770
有  我...
Yeah. I...

614
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,830
我们能进去吗
May we come in?

615
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,310
我得把炉子关了
I just need to turn the stove off.

616
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,660
-待在这儿  妈妈  -是谁
- Stay in here, Mom. - Who is it?

617
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,360
待在这儿就是了
Just stay in here.

618
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,500
只有那一次吗
Only that once?

619
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,560
之后我就没见过他了  也没回他电话
And I haven't seen him since, or returned his calls.

620
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,880
他几次试图联系你
How many times has he tried to call you?

621
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,040
我不知道  大概八九次吧
I don't know. Eight or nine times, maybe.

622
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,490
之后他消停了一段时间
And then he stopped after a while.

623
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,000
他提到过机器人希罗尼穆斯或嘉文·奥尔西吗
Did he mention anything about Hieronymus Bot or Gavin Orsay?

624
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,580
我觉得我该找个律师来
You know, I think I should talk to a lawyer.

625
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,210
现在我们并不怀疑你是同谋
Right now you're not suspected of being an accomplice.

626
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,910
如果你找律师  那我们就要考虑一下了
If you call a lawyer, we might have to reconsider.

627
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,480
-他提到了个黑客  -希罗尼穆斯
- He mentioned some hacker. - Hieronymus.

628
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,660
我告诉他  联系那个人不是什么好主意
I told him I thought it was a bad idea to contact him.

629
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,930
你知道他的说法吗
Are you aware of what he's claiming?

630
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,950
不
No.

631
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,350
他说你在跟他合作
That you and he were working together.

632
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,260
你也相信他那套阴谋论
That you believe in this conspiracy theory.

633
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,840
是你收到了巴恩斯女士的私密照片
That it was you who received explicit photos of Ms. Barnes.

634
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,400
这些都是真的吗
Is any of that true?

635
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,730
你得跟我们回华盛顿
We need you to come back to D.C. with us

636
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,970
在联邦检察官的见证下签署这份声明
and sign this statement in the presence of the U.S. attorney.

637
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,570
-你们想让我指证他说谎吗  -他没有吗
- You want me to call him a liar. - Isn't he?

638
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,000
我不能这样对他
I can't do that to him.

639
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,720
你还得和汤姆·汉默施密特谈谈
We also need you to speak with Tom Hammerschmidt.

640
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,230
求求你们  能别把我扯进来吗
You know what? Please, can you just keep me out of this?

641
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,250
我和那个黑客毫无瓜葛...
I had nothing to do with the hacker or the...

642
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,750
斯克斯基女士  我们愿意相信你
Ms. Skorsky, we want to believe you,

643
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,100
你写下来我们就相信你
and we will if you put all of it in writing.

644
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:49,180
他没犯罪  你们查错人了
He's not a criminal. You're going after the wrong person.

645
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,450
如果你们认为你们能吓唬我
And if you think that you can intimidate me,

646
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,580
在我自己家这样骚扰我
harass me like this in my own home,

647
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,520
我会提出正式投诉
I will file a formal complaint.

648
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,020
你语气越来越像他了
You're starting to sound an awful lot like him.

649
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,840
你们不能逮捕我  我什么都没做
You can't arrest me. I haven't done anything.

650
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,890
你们快走
I'd like you to leave.

651
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,860
我有权请律师  而且你们没有逮捕令
I have a right to legal counsel, and you haven't presented a warrant.

652
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,760
我们可以逮捕你  斯克斯基女士
We can arrest you, Ms. Skorsky,

653
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,460
以教唆网络恐怖主义的罪名
for abetting an act of cyber terrorism.

654
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,040
如果你接下来三年都耗在法庭上
Who's going to take care of your mother while you're

655
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,940
谁来照顾你母亲呢
spending the next three years in courtrooms?

656
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,250
麻烦您抬手
Would you please raise your arms?

657
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,720
-密查姆  不用了  -先生
- No, Meechum. - Sir...

658
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,250
密查姆  我知道你不想跟我握手
Meechum. I know you don't want to shake my hand,

659
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,880
我们就直接略过吧
so we'll just skip that part.

660
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,370
总统完全没有提
The president didn't mention anything about it.

661
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,820
他为什么要提  抓你个冷不丁更好
Why would he? The better to catch you off-guard.

662
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,410
那你为什么要提
Then why would you?

663
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,630
好避免不必要的冲突
So we can avoid unnecessary conflict.

664
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,090
加勒特可不会撒谎
Garrett's not a good liar.

665
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,460
真正会说谎的人总是让人觉得
The gift of a good liar is making people think

666
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,380
他天生不会说谎
you lack a talent for lying.

667
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,640
我远比你了解他
I know him far better than you

668
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,660
我知道他天生会什么  不会什么
and so I know what talents he has and lacks.

669
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,460
但假设他确实说谎了
But let's assume he did lie.

670
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,460
我不担心联邦能源管理委员会的调查
I'm not intimidated by a FERC investigation.

671
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,970
听证会还没开始
You'd have grid overload and brown-outs

672
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,490
就会出现电网过载  灯火管制
before you could even get a hearing.

673
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,120
你在蓄意抬高电价
You are deliberately keeping electric prices at inflated rates,

674
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,360
这是违法的
which is illegal.

675
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,220
不  这是对自由市场的反应
No. I'm responding to free market.

676
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,360
是受监管的自由市场
A regulated free market.

677
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,550
你为什么这么做  弗兰克
Why are you doing this, Frank?

678
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,230
雷米也这样问过我
Remy asked me the same thing.

679
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,020
你这是故意找我茬
You're making this about me.

680
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,790
不是针对你  雷蒙德
This isn't personal, Raymond.

681
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,420
能源市场的健全是我唯一的考虑
The integrity of our energy markets is my only concern.

682
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,210
你当然是针对我
Of course it's personal.

683
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,170
我让你说服加勒特不再与中国针锋相对
I asked you personally to convince Garrett to pull back from China.

684
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,550
而你偏偏跟我对着干
You personally chose not to.

685
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,990
你还故意破坏峰会
You personally sabotaged the summit.

686
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,330
-我政治生涯中从未  -你还故意操纵内阁
- I have never once in my political career allow - And you personally advised the cabinet

687
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,540
-因私人感情而耽误正事  -把我逼上绝路
- personal feelings to get in the way of pragmatic... - to push me up against the wall.

688
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,500
别跟我耍花招  弗兰克  我耍不动了
Do not try and spin me, Frank. I am too old to tango.

689
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,710
那我就直说了
Then I'll be blunt.

690
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,890
接受核能补助  否则就面对能源委员会
Accept the subsidies or deal with FERC.

691
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,730
没有第三条路可选
There is no third way here.

692
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,830
你是故意想毁掉总统吗
Are you intentionally trying to destroy the president?

693
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,340
我是想保护总统  免受你的伤害
I'm trying to protect the president. From you.

694
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,880
你是在为国务卿提名的事报复我吧
This is about the secretary of state nomination, isn't it?

695
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,240
我现在是副总统了  雷蒙德
I'm the vice president now, Raymond.

696
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,310
我不会为陈年往事掉泪
I don't cry over what happened in kindergarten.

697
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,630
我力保你  你才当上副总统
You're vice president because I vouched for you.

698
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,320
因为你别无选择
Because you had no other options.

699
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,370
这是政治需要
Political necessity.

700
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,360
给你24小时做决定
You have 24 hours to decide.

701
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,180
不用送了
I'll show myself out.

702
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,490
你好
Hello.

703
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,760
雷蒙德  这是克莱尔

安德伍德夫人  见到你很荣幸
Mrs. Underwood, it is an honor.

705
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,650
我妻子珍  很欣赏你最近做出的种种努力
Jean-- my wife-- has been very taken with your recent efforts.

706
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,150
改天我一定要见见她
Well, I'd like to meet her one day.

707
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,470
我相信她肯定非常愿意
She would very much like that, I'm sure.

708
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,890
那你怎么看呢
And what about you?

709
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,820
什么意思
I'm sorry?

710
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,970
我们最近在做的事  你怎么看呢
What are your thoughts about our recent efforts?

711
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:59,430
防止不必要的暴力  我当然支持
Oh. I am in favor of anything that prevents unnecessary violence.

712
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,730
很高兴见到你  安德伍德夫人
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Underwood.

713
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,490
祝你今晚开球好运  副总统先生
And, good luck with that first pitch tonight, Mr. Vice President.

714
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,130
这次要投进本垒板  夫人再见
Make it to the plate this time. Ma'am.

715
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,110
这防弹背心真不舒服
This Kevlar is cooking me.

716
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,050
必须得穿  先生
We have to use it, sir.

717
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,740
我练习时没穿过  这下胳膊都转不动了
Well, I didn't practice with it, and now I can hardly rotate my arm.

718
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,070
我该提醒您的  对不起
I should have mentioned it. I apologize.

719
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,620
这球要是过不了本垒板  我拿你是问
If this ball doesn't make it over the plate, it's your ass.

720
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,040
你在这儿干什么  没事可做吗
And what are you doing here? Don't you have things to do?

721
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,970
我没来过卡姆登球场
Never been to Camden Yards.

722
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,260
女士们先生们  马上将投出今晚第一球
Ladies and gentlemen, here to throw out the first pitch tonight,

723
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,370
我们有幸请上  美国副总统
we are honored to introduce the vice president of the United States,

724
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,920
弗兰克·安德伍德
Frank Underwood.

725
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,660
先生  密查姆的球
Boss, boss. Meechum's ball.

726
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,420
非常感谢  吉祥物呢
Thank you very much. Where's the mascot?

727
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,840
唱得真好
Beautifully done.

728
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,040
晚上好
Good evening.

729
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,970
今晚很热  大家都想赶快看比赛
Now I know it's a hot night and you all want to get to the baseball.

730
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,270
所以我一投出这玩意儿  
So as soon as I throw this sucker,

731
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,670
大家就喝点东西  享受比赛
grab a drink, enjoy the game,

732
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,750
祝两队好运
and best of luck to both teams.

733
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,440
我收回那句话  这是在卡姆登球场啊
Scratch that. We're at Camden Yards.

734
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,380
金莺队加油
Go Orioles!

735
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,370
快走  快走
Go, go!

736
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,720
据说是控制节点的
I'm told the distribution line that controls

737
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,390
配电线路造成了供电中断
the pinch point caused the outages.

738
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,330
贝科  你的一家公司
BAPCO. One of your companies.

739
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,260
是的  电量出问题了
Yes, sir. There was a capacity issue.

740
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,600
我的人在以最快速度抢修
We're working as quickly as we can to resolve it.

741
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,080
有三位州长给我打过电话了
Well, I've got three governors calling.

742
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,020
医院在用应急电源  你们最好尽快修理
Hospitals on emergency power. So quickly better mean quickly.

743
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,440
最快也要2到3个小时  也许能快些
The latest estimate I got was two to three hours, maybe sooner.

744
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,240
雷蒙德  这是故意的吗
Raymond, was this intentional?

745
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,840
先生  我知道你最近不怎待见我
Sir, I know you don't hold me in the highest regard at the moment.

746
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:14,950
但是你居然会这么想  我很吃惊
But I am alarmed that you could even entertain such a thought.

747
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,440
但这时候出现这种事让人很难相信是巧合
Yeah, well, the timing makes coincidence hard to swallow.

748
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,060
是热浪的缘故  热浪会让电网达到使用极限
There is a heat wave. That always pushes the grid to its limits.

749
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,250
好吧  尽快让人们摆脱黑暗
All right, let's get the people out of the dark.

750
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,980
每30分钟报告一次进展情况
Updates every 30 minutes on your progress.

751
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,330
先生  我要通知你  我明天可能要
I should inform you, sir, that I may need to take

752
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:34,170
关闭两座电厂做不定期维修
two of my plants offline tomorrow for unscheduled maintenance.

753
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,400
什么  哪两座厂
Why? Which ones?

754
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,930
佐治亚州和田纳西州
Georgia and Tennessee.

755
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,670
这次停电使这两座厂的负荷很大
This blackout has put a great deal of stress on them.

756
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,700
我的工程师们担心燃料棒密封条破损
My engineers are concerned about the seals on the fuel rods.

757
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,190
那么东南部也要断电吗
So we're looking at outages on the southeast grid, too?

758
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,780
有可能  几天吧
Could be. For a few days.

759
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,890
这绝对不行
No, that's unacceptable.

760
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,880
安全第一   我们不希望出事故
Safety comes first. We don't want an accident.

761
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,360
好吧  详细情况报告给琳达  尽快
All right, let's get a full report to Linda, ASAP.

762
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,270
是  先生  谢谢你
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

763
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,200
他在耍花招  
He's toying with you.

764
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,280
不  或许真有这样的安全问题
No, this could be a legitimate safety issue.

765
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,100
他想夺回权力  那几个电厂没事
He wants a seat back at the table. Those plants are fine.

766
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,860
他为什么这么做  我们的确有分歧
Why is he doing this? We've had our differences,

767
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,440
但非要做出这么偏激的事吗
but something drastic like this?

768
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,190
我跟他说了能源委员会可能会展开听证会
Well, I did tell him about the possible FERC action.

769
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,940
什么
You did what?

770
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,160
他打电话给我  我接了电话
Well, he called me. I answered the call.

771
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,180
你怎么不立即通知我
Why didn't you inform me immediately?

772
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,020
他说你们的谈话很有成效
He told me you had a productive talk.

773
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,650
他同意核能补助的事  我以为你们谈妥了
That he was on board with the subsidy. I assumed everything was fine.

774
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,130
他提议进行新一轮贸易谈判
He was proposing renewed trade talks.

775
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,890
我们根本没谈核能补助的事
We didn't talk about the subsidy at all.

776
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,980
他把我们俩都给耍了
He's playing both of us then.

777
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,440
如果他说他同意了  
If he told you he was on board,

778
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,740
你为什么还提能源委员会的事呢
why'd you bring up FERC?

779
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,650
我说这下我放心了
I told him I was relieved.

780
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,620
要是他不答应  我们可要采取行动了
That we could have taken action if he didn't comply.

781
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,740
你觉得他是在套你的话吗
You think he's fishing?

782
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,010
想套出我们下一步行动
To see what our next move might be?

783
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,340
就是这样  先生
I think so, sir. I mean,

784
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,690
南部两个发电厂的事他在说谎
he is lying about those two plants in the south.

785
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,420
我们不能猜测  一定要确定
Well, we can't guess. We have to be certain.

786
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,290
您想让雷蒙德·塔斯克来做风险评估
Well, do you want Raymond Tusk to assess that risk?

787
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,010
还是政府来做
Or the United States government?

788
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,280
你是说我们接管他的电厂吗
Are you suggesting we take over his facilities?

789
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,760
有过这样的先例
There is precedent there.

790
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,730
伍德罗·威尔逊接管铁路三年整
Woodrow Wilson did it with the railroads for three full years.

791
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,500
那是战争时期
In a time of war.

792
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,920
是在危急时期  就像现在这样
In a time of emergency, which is what this is.

793
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,100
人民需要一位领袖  总统先生
The country needs a leader, Mr. President.

794
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,550
满足他们  别向雷蒙德·塔斯克屈服
Give them one. Do not bend to Raymond Tusk.

795
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,580
看完了
I'm done.

796
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,850
我说过你可能不喜欢
I said you might not like it.

797
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,290
这让我看起来像是疯了
It makes me seem crazy.

798
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,490
这是最收敛的版本了
This is the most toned-down version.

799
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,060
我尽力用最和善的口吻  不掺入偏见
I tried to be as kind as I could without being biased.

800
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,350
你不希望这报道公诸于众吧
I don't think you want this going out into the world.

801
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,570
我能和简宁谈谈吗
Can I talk to Janine?

802
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,180
让他走
Tell him to go.

803
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,490
他想让你离开
He wants you to leave.

804
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,340
-你说了谎  -卢卡斯
- You lied. - Lucas...

805
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,880
你骗了汤姆  也骗了联邦检察官
You lied to Tom. You lied to the U.S. Attorney.

806
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,660
-我不知道还能怎么办  -说真话 
- I didn't know what else to do. - Tell the truth.

807
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,450
他们会逮捕我  他们会让我失去信誉
They'll arrest me. They'll discredit everything I say.

808
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,690
到时  人们会像不相信你那样不相信我
And nobody is going to believe me more than they believe you.

809
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,280
但我们能让公众知道  让人们产生疑问
But we can get the story out there. Get people asking questions.

810
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,440
不  他们只会觉得我们俩都疯了
No. It'll just look like two crazy people instead of one.

811
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,770
所以你打算自保
So you're saving yourself.

812
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,020
我想保护我们两个人
I'm trying to save the both of us.

813
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,140
拜托了
Please.

814
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,840
认罪吧
Take the plea.

815
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,940
-我是无罪的  -你不是
- I'm not guilty. - You are.

816
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,330
你犯了罪
You committed a crime.

817
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,950
-罪名还不止一项  -但不包括谋杀
- Multiple crimes. - Not murder.

818
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:56,300
承认罪行  好好表现  早点出来
Take the plea. Be good. Get out early.

819
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,850
所有人都坑我
Everybody -- everybody's fucked me.

820
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,900
如果我是想害你  就不会来了
If I was trying to fuck you I wouldn't be here.

821
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,130
他要逃脱罪责了  是吗
He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?

822
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,500
是的
Yes, he is.

823
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,830
-有加冰的茶吗  给我一杯  -没有
- Take an iced tea if you have any. - We don't.

824
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,510
我真不想总这样偷偷摸摸的
I wish I didn't have to keep coming through back doors like this.

825
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,360
这不是不想让新闻界的朋友
Well, we wouldn't want our friends in the fourth estate

826
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,880
知道你来这里嘛
to know you were here, would we?

827
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,910
特别是你费了好大的功夫
Especially since you've gone to such lengths

828
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,070
一直置身政治斗争之外
to remain above the fray of politics.

829
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,850
你不能夺走发电厂  弗兰克
You can't seize the plants, Frank.

830
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,380
我们还没得手呢
We haven't seized anything yet.

831
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,730
我们有这准备  但只要你合作就不会那样
We're ready to, but we won't if you cooperate.

832
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,720
这是违法的
It's illegal.

833
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,600
并不违法  你心里清楚
It's not. You know that.

834
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:03,950
紧急情况下  总统可以下达行政命令
The president can issue an executive order in times of emergency.

835
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,110
我会在法庭上据理力争
I'll fight it in court.

836
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,480
那比能源委员会的调查更费时
Which will take even longer than a FERC investigation would.

837
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,150
而在此期间  你的发电厂无法盈利
And in the meantime, you make nothing from those plants.

838
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,420
我们说好的
We agreed.

839
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,120
就在这里  我们达成了协议
Right here in this room, we agreed to work together.

840
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,940
做出了合作的承诺
We agreed as men of our word.

841
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,560
我一直信守承诺
And I held up my end of that bargain

842
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,490
-可你在法案的事上背信弃义  -我让雷米去协助你了
- until you abandoned me on the bill. - I sent Remy to help you.

843
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,830
那是法案通过参议院之后  你之前可没帮忙
After I got it passed through the Senate with no help from you.

844
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,240
我不能和总统闹僵
I had to protect my relationship with the president.

845
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,830
斯波特瑟尔韦尼亚峰会期间你还企图利用我
And then you tried to use me during the summit in Spotsylvania.

846
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:35,160
我活着不是为了做你最好的朋友
I was not put on this earth to be your best friend

847
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,970
也不是为了和你分享我的所有情报
or to share every piece of information I have with you.

848
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:45,030
我们只是达成了互利共赢的合作关系
We agreed to a mutually beneficial partnership. That's all.

849
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,230
是的  而我现在发现
Yes. And what's become very clear to me

850
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,620
跟你合作对我没有任何好处
is that I benefit in no way from this partnership.

851
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,100
我们就不装傻了
Let's not pretend to be naive.

852
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,110
我们最看重的都是个人利益
We both respect self-interest above all else.

853
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,310
现在  双方利益不再一致
Our versions of that no longer align.

854
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,820
你就要犯下无法挽回的错误了
You are on the verge of making an irreversible mistake,

855
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,400
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

856
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,050
我的确可能是在犯错  谁知道呢
I may well be making a mistake. Who knows?

857
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,520
我只知道你会联系琳达
What I do know is that you'll be calling Linda

858
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,960
告诉她你接受核能补助
and telling her that you'll accept the subsidies.

859
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:26,150
你有钱  雷蒙德
You may have all the money, Raymond,

860
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,350
但我有权
but I have all the men with guns.

861
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:31,390
这是设好号码的一次性电话  她在等你答复
It's a burner, pre-dialed. She's expecting.

862
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:35,370
对了  这是昨晚的
Oh, and, uh, yes. From last night.

863
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,090
按行话说  现在轮到你发球了
The ball's in your court, as they say.

864
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,610
上帝  你吓死我了
Oh, Jesus Christ. You scared the shit outta me.

865
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,430
你就这么随随便便地喊上帝吗
Are you supposed to take the lord's name in vain like that?

866
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,540
继续开着
Leave it on.

867
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,970
电费太贵
It costs too much.

868
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,320
我会付的
I'll take care of it.

869
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,150
古德温认罪了  他要进监狱了
Goodwin took the plea. He's going away.

870
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,430
所以一切都结束了吗
So does that mean this is all over?

871
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:25,470
没有  我们还是要小心
No. We still have to be careful.

872
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,480
为什么  没有他  就不会有人找我了吧
But why? If he's gone, then nobody's looking for me, right?

873
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,960
据我们所知没有
Not that we know of.

874
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,850
在确保万无一失之前  一切照常
Until we know, nothing changes.

875
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,860
那你来就是为了让我空欢喜一场吗
So what, you just came over here to get my hopes up?

876
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,720
我来是为了确保你今晚不去教堂
I came here to make sure that you don't go to church tonight.

877
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,870
你想干我吗
Do you want to fuck me?

878
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,790
-这才是你的本意吧  -不是
- Is that what this is all about? - No.

879
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,110
你以前干过我
You've done it before.

880
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,300
那不一样
That was different.

881
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,520
够了
Stop it.

882
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,730
我一向能察觉男人对我的欲望
If there's one thing I know, it's when a man wants me.

883
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,050
我在教会得知了拉结的故事
I learned who Rachel was in church.

884
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,050
{\an8}拉结是《圣经》中和瑞秋同名的女子

885
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,180
她年轻漂亮
She was young and beautiful.

886
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,890
雅各在她照看羊喝水时爱上了她
Jacob fell in love with her while she was watering a lamb.

887
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:47,380
他做了七年的工
And she became his wife after he worked seven years

888
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,020
才终于娶到她
to earn her hand in marriage.

889
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,500
拉结有个叫约瑟的儿子
Rachel had one son. Joseph.

890
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,950
后来他成了国王
He became a king.

891
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,840
你饿不饿
Are you hungry?

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}这一集中  能源大亨塔斯克用"拉闸限电"的手段来要挟总统
现实中美国的能源巨头可不敢如此嚣张
现实中美国联邦政府对能源公司的监管是相当严格的
能源部对企业的日常运营有诸多法规限制
一旦出现事故  造成污染
公司会受司法部的调查  起诉  承担严重后果
2010年4月  英国石油公司钻井平台发生事故
造成墨西哥湾严重污染  美国司法部的调查至今仍未结束
除了多名直接责任人被起诉
英国石油公司截止目前已经在多宗诉讼中赔偿了422亿美元

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国作为世界上最大的能源消耗国  如何解决长期的能源供应
同时兼顾环境保护  一直是两党的争论焦点
共和党在能源问题上主张充分利用美国的石油资源
放松对传统能源行业的监管
民主党则推崇绿色可再生能源
同时通过立法监管对石油和煤炭企业严加限制
过去几年中  由于美国发现了大量的页岩气储备
同时开采技术有了新的突破  渴望在2020年实现"北美能源独立"
不再依靠北美以外地区的能源进口
所以在页岩气价格迅速下降的背景下
奥巴马政府主张在能源上采取"百花齐放"的政策
在推动新型能源的同时  也鼓励传统能源的发展
但是由于民主党左派一味强调环境和气候变化问题
美国传统能源行业普遍认为现政府的政策极大地束缚了行业的发展

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}由于两党在能源问题上立场相左
所以现实中的塔斯克这样的能源巨头非常注意本行业的公共形象
如果有"拉闸限电"这样的事情发生  不仅涉及的公司会被调查
在民怨沸腾的情况下  国会也极可能迅速介入
通过立法手段对整个行业加强监管
