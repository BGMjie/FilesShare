13

他可不算是最令人振奋的副总统人选吧
This is not the most inspiring choice for a vice president, right?

14
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,770
他的确是位备受尊敬的官员  务实
I -- I mean, a well-respected operator. Pragmatic.

15
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,640
但老实说
But let's face it.

16
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,280
这也许只是总统对国会的示好
This is probably just a nod to Congress.

17
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,290
提拔一名议员
Tapping one of their own.

18
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,410
下次大选前  他也就是个充数的
It's really nothing more than a placeholder until 2016, assuredly.

19
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,860
我对他私下宣誓就职毫不惊讶
I'm not surprised he's doing a private swearing-in.

20
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,250
我猜总统是想
My bet is that the president wants to draw

21
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,060
尽量保持低调
as little attention to this as possible.

22
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,460
这其中实在没什么让人...
There's just no real wow fa--

23
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,100
克里斯蒂娜怎么样
Christina's working out well?

24
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,740
还在适应  不过我目前挺满意的
She's getting her sea legs, but I've been happy so far.

25
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,020
她很勤奋
She works hard.

26
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,150
她能替我陪总统出行
It's a big load off my shoulders

27
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,570
我可是大大松了一口气
when she can travel with the president instead of me.

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,900
我留在这边更有用武之地
I get so much more done when I stay here.

29
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,200
总统有看好的党鞭人选吗
The president have a preference in the whip's race?

30
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,060
没想到局面会变得这么不堪
Can't believe how ugly it's gotten.

31
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,970
真让人无比失望
It was more disappointing than anything.

32
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,200
当心  是啊
Watch out. Yeah, it was.

33
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,870
没打扰你们吧
I hope I'm not interrupting.

34
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,450
没有
Not at all.

35
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,740
这可真是不一般
This is something else.

36
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,910
安保要求  他们得赶工  小心
Security specs. They had to work fast. Watch out.

37
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,660
这里简直像战场
It's like a war zone around here.

38
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,900
改建的目的就是隔绝外界影响
The idea is to keep the war from getting in.

39
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,840
党鞭的竞争怎么样了  议员先生
How's the whip's race coming, congressman?

40
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,240
你和霍华德的竞争蛮激烈的
It's tight between you and Howard.

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,510
这你得问他
Well you'd have to ask Howard,

42
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,780
不过他大概在忙着琢磨怎么搞我
if he's not too busy trying to sodomize me.

43
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,940
去打个招呼吧
Shall we go and say hello?

44
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,400
天呐  别逼我跟他说话
For god sakes, don't make me talk to that man.

45
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,880
你好  霍华德
Good to see you, Howard.

46
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,060
见到你真高兴  韦斯
Nice to see you, Wes.

47
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,060
高兴个屁啊
Yeah. I bet it is.

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,820
-鲍勃  -弗兰克
- Bob. - Frank.

49
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,110
谢谢你邀请我  弗兰克
Appreciate you inviting me, Frank.

50
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,470
-什么  -谢谢你邀请我
- What? - Thanks for inviting me.

51
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,250
不客气
You bet.

52
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,910
法官大人
Judge.

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,910
{\an8}总统及副总统宣誓就职时需由最高法院首席法官见证

54
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,070
你好啊
Good to see you.

55
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,880
有换衣服的地吗
Is there somewhere I can go to change?

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,890
当然有  大厅那边
Yes, absolutely. There's room down the hall.

57
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,790
道格  照应一下法官
Doug, will you take care of the judge?

58
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,830
他准备好了就赶紧开始
And when he's ready, let's get this thing over with.

59
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,150
我去叫大家进来
I'll start bringing 'em in.

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,470
我自愿承担此义务
...that I take this obligation freely,

61
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,720
既无保留  也不逃避
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion...

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,370
我自愿承担此义务
...that I take this obligation freely,

63
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,070
既无保留  也不逃避
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion...

64
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,200
我将尽职尽责
And that I will well...

65
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,910
离总统只差一步
One heartbeat away from the presidency,

66
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,530
却不用一张选票
and not a single vote cast in my name.

67
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,070
民主也不过如此
Democracy is so overrated.

68
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,520
完成我的本职工作  上帝保佑
...office on which I am about to enter, so help me God.

69
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,150
我将尽职尽责
And that I will well and faithfully discharge

70
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,050
完成我的本职工作
the duties of the office on which I am about to enter,

71
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,720
上帝保佑
so help me god.

72
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,890
祝贺您  副总统先生
Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.

73
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,900
好了  我们继续治理国家吧
All right, let's get back to running the country.

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,710
你们中一人将接任党鞭
Now, one of you is gonna replace me as the whip.

75
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,980
你们俩最有希望  大家也知道你们都想争取
You're the two frontrunners, and we know you both want it.

76
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,860
可你们一点领导风范也没有
And you're not behaving like men who belong in the leadership.

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,080
场面话就别说了
We need to tone down the rhetoric.

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,280
你们伤及了党派利益
You're hurting your party.

79
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,560
我只是在回应霍华德抛出的谎言
I'm just responding to the lies Howard's been slinging.

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,630
公费出游是真事  韦斯  不是我编的
Those junkets happened, Wes. I'm not making it up.

81
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,870
那你任人唯亲呢
And nepotism's any better.

82
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,210
你知道那不是事实
That's just not true, and you know it.

83
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,690
所以你妹夫是凑巧被任命为财务部长了吗
And your sister's husband just happened to be appointed state treasurer.

84
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,930
前妹夫  是的
Ex-husband. And yes.

85
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,360
真是一派胡言  霍华德
That is such a load of crap, Howard.

86
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
先生们  鲍勃说的对
Gentlemen, Bob is right.

87
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,400
你俩的斗争一旦被曝光
This sort of cat-fighting gets out in the press,

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,290
不管谁赢  都不是好事
whichever one of you wins hits the ground limping.

89
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,980
别出阴招了  大家文明一点
Let's keep it clean and bring some civility back to the house.

90
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,710
可以吗
Can we agree to that?

91
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,230
你俩握个手我会安心一些
I'd feel a lot better if you shook hands on it.

92
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,680
谢谢
Thank you.

93
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,540
我和他在一起呢  克里斯蒂娜
I'm with him right now, Christina.

94
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,770
我走了  我晚些时候去你办公室
I'm off. I'll swing by your office later.

95
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,770
不用了  还没装修好呢
Don't. It's not ready yet.

96
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,980
我就在这儿办公了
I'll be working from here.

97
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,780
什么事
What?

98
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,030
塔斯克来了
Tusk is in town.

99
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,780
他45分钟后和总统会面
He's meeting with the president in 45 minutes.

100
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,730
克里斯蒂娜刚告诉我的
Christina just told me.

101
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,010
商贸联委会谈判的事
The Joint Commission talks.

102
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,990
她就是这么说的
That's what she said.

103
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,590
克里斯蒂娜还真有用
Christina is proving useful.

104
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,560
我们随时联系
We stay in touch.

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
给凯茜·杜兰特打电话
Get me Cathy Durant.

106
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,290
你的人要过来吗
Your people coming by?

107
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,880
就只有我的新幕僚长
Just my new chief of staff.

108
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,730
招人之前也没有别人了
That's all I've got until we hire more.

109
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,690
做副总统夫人是什么感觉
So how does it feel to be married to the vice president?

110
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,920
完全一样  就是有点吵
Exactly the same. Just louder.

111
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,160
国务卿杜兰特
Secretary Durant.

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,370
凯茜
Cathy.

113
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,320
雷蒙德
Raymond.

114
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,270
祝贺你  副总统先生
Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.

115
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,920
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,570
向你介绍国务卿杜兰特
May I please introduce Secretary Durant.

117
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,260
很荣幸  国务卿女士
My pleasure, Madam Secretary.

118
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,920
简直太意外了
This is quite a surprise.

119
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,630
我根本不知道你来了
I had no idea you were in town.

120
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
早上好  总统阁下
Morning, sir.

121
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,100
总统先生
Mr. President.

122
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,990
凯瑟琳
Catherine.

123
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,290
我们刚好撞见了雷蒙德
We just happened to run into Raymond.

124
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,480
太好了
Wonderful.

125
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,080
进来吧
Come on in.

126
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,440
电话记录肯定能证明我是对的
The phone records will absolutely prove I'm right.

127
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,900
根本就没有电话记录  你知道的
There were no phone records. You know that.

128
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,660
那还有运营商的数据历史记录
The data history with the carrier.

129
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,070
重新调查根本不可能  就算重新调查了
Even if we got the case reopened, which isn't gonna happen,

130
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,240
你知道要拿到获取运营商数据的令状有多难吗
do you have any idea how hard it is to get a warrant for phone data?

131
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,560
有相当理由就行
Probable cause.

132
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,200
把他找来进行讯问
Bring him in for questioning.

133
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,540
严格说这事在你辖区之内
Technically you have jurisdiction.

134
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,720
美国的副总统
The vice president of the United States.

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,310
我知道你觉得这很荒谬
I know this all sounds preposterous to you,

136
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,670
但如果你好好看看我的笔记
but if -- if you go through my notes --

137
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,180
我早就看过了
We've been through your notes.

138
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,090
你听是听了  但你根本没听进去
You've listened. But you haven't heard me.

139
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,790
的确是间接证据  但都合情合理
Circumstantial, yes. But plausible.

140
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,520
我知道你曾为更小的原因重新调查案子
I know you've reopened cases on less.

141
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,960
你必须停手了  哥们
This has gotta stop, man.

142
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,750
我们说来说去就这么几句
We keep having the same conversation.

143
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,300
不可能是意外
It can't be an accident.

144
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,300
好吧  我给你看个东西
Okay. I'm gonna show you something.

145
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,800
CNN想拿到这个
CNN tried to get a hold of this.

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,200
出于对家属的尊重  我们拒绝了
We eighty-sixed it out of respect to the family.

147
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,690
监控录像吗
The footage?

148
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,000
你看了肯定难受
It's not easy to watch.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,130
我想看
I want to see it.

150
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,940
她要么是绊倒了  要么是跳下去的
She tripped. Or jumped.

151
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,190
她不是自杀
She didn't jump.

152
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,610
我逐帧放给你看
Here it is, frame by frame.

153
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,960
还有两个目击证人
Now, there were two witnesses.

154
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,770
一个是患眼部黄斑变性的70岁老太太
One was a 70-year-old woman with macular degeneration.

155
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,800
她什么都没看清楚
All she saw was a blur.

156
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,370
第二个就是车上的列车员
The second was the conductor of the train.

157
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,780
他说看上去像是她摔倒了
He said it looked like she fell.

158
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,340
除了这两个证人  就是监控录像了
I mean between those two and this video, that's all there is.

159
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,150
想看你可以看一万遍  但是这个案子结了
You can watch it a million times, but this case is closed.

160
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,020
我们得把议程限制在几个关键问题上
We should limit the agenda to a couple of key issues:

161
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,590
工业制品的进口关税
import tariffs on industrial manufactured goods

162
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,820
以及稀土元素的出口限额
and export quotas on rare earth elements.

163
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,170
这两个都是他们的政治筹码
They're using both as political levers.

164
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,290
我也认为在这两个问题上我们能取得进展
I agree these are two areas where we can make meaningful progress.

165
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,460
但我更担心企业网络攻击的增加
But I'm worried about the rise in corporate cyber attacks.

166
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,860
扯上这个就没完了
That's a rabbit hole.

167
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,150
我们早晚得说这件事
Well, we have to address it sooner or later.

168
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,290
问题是我们要不要现在谈这个
It's just a matter of whether we want to address it now.

169
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,220
中国人不喜欢意外
The Chinese don't like surprises.

170
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,540
我只是想说
All I'm proposing

171
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,880
我们现在利用商贸联委会谈判委婉地提出这个问题
is that we use the Joint Commission talks to bring it up gently now,

172
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,550
为下轮谈判做好铺垫
set the stage for the next round.

173
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,610
我是个商人  不是外交官
Look, I'm a businessman, not a diplomat.

174
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,740
但我是个在中国工作了35年的商人
But I'm a businessman with 35 years experience working in China.

175
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,090
和他们谈判  不能太贪心
When they come to the table, you don't get greedy.

176
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,130
你在福建有一个合资精炼厂
You're working on a co-venture refinery project in Fujian.

177
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,360
这也是业内首家
Which would be the first of its kind.

178
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,010
放开了增加投资的渠道...
Open the gateway for increased investment --

179
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,820
网络攻击对那些合作企业构成威胁
Cyber attacks threaten those co-ventures.

180
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,810
如果中方可以通过
There's less a need for them

181
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,760
商业间谍活动获取新技术  也就无需合作了
if the Chinese can obtain new technology from corporate espionage.

182
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,850
弗兰克  你觉得呢
Frank, what do you think?

183
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,670
我更倾向于雷蒙德的想法
I lean more toward Raymond's thinking.

184
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,950
如果引起中方的反感  那多年的努力都白费了
If we antagonize the Chinese we could undo years of progress.

185
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,030
我可以低调行事  绝不会使强硬手腕
Allow me to do this quietly, with a soft touch.

186
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,780
我不会激怒他们  先生
I won't antagonize them, sir.

187
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,140
我们最要不得的就是自找麻烦
The last thing we want to do is rock the boat.

188
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,440
你想怎么办  凯瑟琳
What do you have in mind, Catherine?

189
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,270
建议性议程
A suggested agenda.

190
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,980
而不是作为要求
Not a demand.

191
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,020
这件事由中层出面  我根本不插手
We'll keep it mid-level. I won't get anywhere near it.

192
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,710
雷蒙德
Raymond?

193
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,310
我已经表明了顾虑
I've voiced my concerns.

194
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,530
-要格外谨慎克制  -我向您保证  先生
- A very soft touch. - You have my word, sir.

195
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,870
好
Good.

196
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,640
雷蒙德  一起吃个午餐吧
Raymond? Want to grab some lunch?

197
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,830
乐意之极
Would love to.

198
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,380
谢谢  弗兰克  欢迎加入白宫
Thanks, Frank. Welcome to the West Wing.

199
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,660
谢谢您  先生
Thank you, sir.

200
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,050
总统就像旷野上的一棵孤树
The president is like a lone tree in an empty field.

201
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,120
风往哪吹  他就往哪倒
He leans whichever way the wind is blowing.

202
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,350
现在雷蒙德·塔斯克的西风吹得实在太猛
And right now Raymond Tusk blows far too strong from the west.

203
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,180
那是假发吗
Is that a wig?

204
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,260
不是  他都留了好几个月了
No. He's been growing it out for months.

205
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,030
戴安说她喜欢长发
Diane says she likes it long.

206
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,290
我告诉她  等她看到
I told her she'll feel differently

207
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,610
他留起长发辩就会改主意了
once she sees the first dread lock.

208
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,660
或者闻到
Or smells it.

209
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,510
我上周末去看了你女儿
I went to see your daughter last weekend.

210
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,090
她怎么样
How is she?

211
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,390
-想看看照片吗  -好啊
- You want to see a picture? - Okay.

212
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,320
-她妈妈在吗  -嗯
- Was her mother there? - Yeah.

213
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,140
他们的钱够用吧
Are they okay on money?

214
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,940
格林伍兹的保险率费一月份要上调了
The rate at Greenwoods is going up in January.

215
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,060
凯特琳娜担心钱不够用
Catalina is worried she's gonna be short.

216
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,170
我会多打点去她账上
I'll make sure to put more into the account.

217
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,120
如果你不舒服  我们不用聊她
We don't have to talk about her if you don't...

218
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,900
不不  没事  我很感谢你去看她
No, no, no. It's fine. I appreciate you going to see her.

219
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,670
抱歉  泰德
I'm sorry, Ted.

220
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,850
你邀我一起吃午餐  我以为你是想...
I thought that when you asked me to lunch it was because you want --

221
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,270
不不  没错
No, no, no. I mean, yes,

222
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,940
我想确保她们的需求都得到满足
I want to make sure they have what they need.

223
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,010
但是  不
But, no,

224
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,450
我想找你谈是为了...
the reason I wanted to talk --

225
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,930
洛莉·塔特
Lorrie Tate.

226
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,640
洛莉是我朋友  她怎么了
Lorrie's a friend of mine. What about her?

227
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,100
她说你有意竞选党鞭
She mentioned you're interested in the whip's race.

228
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,320
天呐
Oh, no.

229
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,700
真希望她没这么说
I wish she hadn't.

230
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,940
为什么
Why not?

231
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,250
因为很荒唐啊
Because it's ridiculous.

232
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,470
是吗
Is it?

233
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,680
我只是随口说说
I just mentioned it off-hand.

234
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,720
韦伯和巴克沃特的竞争简直...
The whole Webb and Buchwalter thing is just --

235
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,020
一团糟
Complete mess.

236
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,620
但我是开玩笑的
But I wasn't serious.

237
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,490
我觉得你该认真想想
I think you should be serious.

238
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,890
你想竞选党鞭吗
Do you want to do it?

239
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,430
我没有经验啊  泰德  我还...
I don't have the experience, Ted. And I -- I --

240
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,130
想不想
Yes or no?

241
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,990
当然想
Yes, of course.

242
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,320
将来再说
Someday.

243
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,190
但现在  我没有他们那样的财力
But now I -- I don't have the money they do.

244
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,920
你用我的钱  就有了
Unless you use mine.

245
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,820
你不能把你的钱浪费在...
You can't waste your money on --

246
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,050
如果我找到那些还持观望态度的人
If I funnel my PAC money

247
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,580
把我的政治行动委员会资金给他们一些
to some folks who are on the fence,

248
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,380
在你正式宣布前  拉拢一些支持者
round up a couple dozen commitments before you announce,

249
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,560
那你立刻就是有力竞争者
that would make you an instant contender.

250
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,110
你说这是浪费吗
Now tell me that's a waste.

251
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,910
这可是几十万啊
We're talking hundreds of thousands.

252
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,660
这可不是圣诞礼物  杰姬
It's not a Christmas present, Jackie.

253
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,600
如果你是党鞭  我就在领导层有了坚定的盟友
With you as whip I have a strong ally in the leadership.

254
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,960
我的获益不比你少
I stand to gain as much as you.

255
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,720
稍等片刻
Hang on one second.

256
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,860
我不知道哪里...
I don't know where the...

257
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,980
怎么样  他信了吗
How did it go? Did he buy it?

258
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,020
不管你给他吹了什么风  吹得很到位
Whatever bug you put in his ear burrowed deep.

259
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,810
很简单  他喜欢你  对你视如己出
It was easy. The man adores you like you're his own child.

260
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,080
但你可得选我做首席副党鞭
But you sure as hell better make me Chief Deputy.

261
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,130
我得先当选
I need to win first.

262
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,490
我和泰德两票  还剩111票
Ted and I make two. 111 to go.

263
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,610
副党鞭会数数总是好事
It's always good when the Chief Deputy knows her arithmetic.

264
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,700
别扯淡  我们数票吧
Fuck off. Let's start taking names.

265
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,080
这个还不错
This one seems promising.

266
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,080
康纳·埃利斯  可靠  有经验
Connor Ellis. He's solid. Good experience.

267
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,300
是他解决了琼斯参议员
Oh, he's the one that got Senator Jones out of that mess

268
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,380
{\an8}借调查名义影响民意的民意调查

269
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,380
推手民调的烂摊子
with the push polling.

270
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,910
是啊  免受纪律委员会的调查
Yes. Kept him from the ethics committee.

271
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,440
面试一下吧
Let's set up an interview.

272
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,290
我安排一下日程
I'll find a good time in schedule.

273
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,130
我们说说日程的事
Let's talk about the schedule.

274
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,320
好好挑一下我该参加哪些活动
I think we need to be more selective with the events I do.

275
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,580
有些是上任副总统夫人没去成的
Some of these are leftovers from Mrs. Matthews.

276
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,520
你想取消也可以
We can cancel whatever you like.

277
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,680
这是什么
And what's this?

278
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,750
你丈夫要为两位新晋海军陆战队将军授衔
Your husband will be pinning stars on two newly commissioned Marine generals.

279
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,080
这个你应该去
I think that's one you should do.

280
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,530
给我介绍一下
Okay. Walk me through it.

281
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,960
两位将军分别是艾莉西娅·汉普顿
The generals are Alicia Hampton

282
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,670
和道顿·麦金尼斯
and Dalton McGinnis.

283
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,250
6点50到场
Arriving at 6:50 --

284
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,530
道顿·麦金尼斯吗
Dalton McGinnis?

285
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,550
是的  认识吗
Yes. Do you know him?

286
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,800
大学同学
We went to college together.

287
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,970
刚说到哪了
I'm sorry, where were we?

288
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,700
什么时候到
Arrive what time?

289
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,730
6点50
6:50.

290
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,370
很好  出席人员名单给我一份
Great. I'd like a list of all the people that will be attending.

291
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,340
我被排除在外没什么
It's not that big a deal if I get left out,

292
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,260
可你是国务卿啊
but you're the secretary of state.

293
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,830
塔斯克怎么能参与决策
I mean, Tusk should not be determining policy.

294
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,530
只有总统可以决定你该怎么做
The president alone should instruct you on what you are to pursue.

295
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,140
他们什么关系
What's their relationship?

296
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,820
他一直给总统出谋划策
He's had his ear for years.

297
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,060
那是顾问
An advisor...

298
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,150
更像是导师  总统很重视他的建议
More of a mentor. And one whose advice is not easily dismissed.

299
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,240
他还会继续要求忽视网络战
He's gonna keep pushing back on cyber warfare.

300
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,520
除非我给提上议程
Not if I get it on the agenda.

301
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,900
不  你提上议程他更会来劲
No, especially if you get it on the agenda.

302
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,090
商贸联委会谈判再度开启时
Tusk is not gonna take any chances

303
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,970
塔斯克绝不会冒丝毫风险
when the next Joint Commission talks come around.

304
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,810
你刚刚不是支持他吗
You agreed with him in the meeting.

305
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,670
如果我们站一边  他的态度只会更强硬
If we had ganged up, he would have taken a firmer position.

306
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,550
说不定
For all we know,

307
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,710
他现在就在劝总统改主意呢
he's convincing the president right now to change his mind.

308
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,040
所以我们绝不能给他机会
Now we need to remove that option as a possibility.

309
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,590
怎么办
How?

310
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,250
这次谈判中就强迫中方回应网络安全问题
Force the Chinese to confront the issue now, this round of talks.

311
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,210
我答应总统不采取强硬手段的
I promised the president a soft touch.

312
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,700
我不能有意食言
I can't intentionally break my promise.

313
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,910
如果是无意的呢
What if it was unintentional?

314
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,220
凯茜  如果你不喜欢现在的局势
Cathy, if you don't like how the table is set,

315
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,830
就干脆搅局
turn over the table.

316
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,960
你偷吸
You're cheating.

317
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,200
哪有  是电子烟
No, I'm not. It's vapor.

318
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,310
那也算
Still.

319
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,030
你该试试
You should try it.

320
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,690
会上瘾  但没副作用
Addiction without the consequences.

321
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,050
你自己抽
It's all yours.

322
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,530
不睡吗
You staying up?

323
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,670
明晚的授衔仪式
This ceremony tomorrow night.

324
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,040
你不想去
You don't want to go.

325
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,670
除非我必须去
If I don't have to.

326
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,440
我也不喜欢
I hate these sorta things, too.

327
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,710
但这是副总统的首次亮相
But it is my first public appearance as vice president.

328
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,280
好吧
Okay.

329
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,380
谢谢
Thank you.

330
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,630
要不要把这儿改成办公室
Should we turn this into a proper office?

331
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,560
可以啊  楼下没有私密性
That's not a bad idea. No privacy downstairs.

332
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,050
我去找装修队
I'll talk to the contractor.

333
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,260
晚安  弗兰西斯
Goodnight, Francis.

334
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,380
晚安
Goodnight.

335
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,270
先生  先生  根据国会议事录
Sir! Sir! Congressional Record.

336
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,090
不是要谈到六点吗
Weren't the talks supposed to go until six?

337
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,530
他们不听  我们谈不下去
We can't talk if they won't listen.

338
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,910
中方不谈了吗
Did the Chinese walk out?

339
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,940
我们已经表明  除非他们肯谈政府资助的
We made it clear that we won't discuss any other issues

340
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,600
网络攻击  否则其他问题免谈
until government-sponsored cyber attacks are on the table.

341
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,240
显然他们不开心了
Apparently that's not what they wanted to hear.

342
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,960
中方代表离席之前你说了什么
Sir, what did you tell the Chinese delegation before they walked out?

343
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,210
我们没派人去
We didn't have anybody there.

344
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,440
商贸联委会谈判通常很无聊的
The Joint Commission is usually a snooze-fest.

345
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,680
今天不是
Not today it wasn't.

346
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,890
我已经让格里尔去弄了
I've got Greer on it.

347
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,260
这不是国际板块的新闻吗
Isn't this international?

348
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,810
如果要写网络战的背景资料
We need somebody from the tech beat

349
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,300
就得请科技板块的记者
if we want any background on cyber warfare.

350
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,860
他找到人接受署名采访了吗
Does he have anybody on record yet?

351
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,750
中方不肯谈
The Chinese aren't talking.

352
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,210
美国代表团的话美联社都报道了
And all the U.S. delegation said is what's in the AP wire.

353
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,290
无论如何两小时内网上要出报道
I want something online in the next two hours.

354
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,400
本周内发一篇深入后续报道
In-depth follow-up sometime this week.

355
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,520
卢卡斯
Hey, Lucas?

356
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,880
你还好吗
You all right?

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,550
好啊  怎么了
Yeah. Why?

358
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,550
你还穿着昨天穿的那身
You're wearing the same clothes you wore yesterday.

359
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,120
是吗
Am I?

360
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,240
我不知道你私生活发生了什么
I don't know what's going on in your personal life,

361
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,630
但似乎已经影响到你的工作了
but it seems to be entering the workplace.

362
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,810
仪表很重要
Appearances matter.

363
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,640
我们的编辑不能比他的记者
And we can't have an editor looking more disheveled

364
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,850
还不修边幅
than his reporters.

365
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,210
两小时  一定给你个交待
Two hours. You'll have something.

366
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,060
你知道杰姬·夏普要竞选党鞭吗
Did you know Jackie Sharp's running for Whip?

367
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,680
不知道  这是我第一次听说
No, this is the first I'm hearing of it.

368
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,940
我跟韦伯说了
I spoke to Webb.

369
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,750
洛莉·塔特给他发了一封关于我的电邮
He got an email from Lorrie Tate about me.

370
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,760
戴夫·霍兰德给我发了一封关于他的电邮
I got one from Dave Holland about him.

371
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,010
这我不管
Which means nothing to me.

372
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,700
公费旅游  任人唯亲  塔特跟夏普很亲密
The junkets, the nepotism. Tate and Sharp are close.

373
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,630
霍兰德跟她在退伍军人事务委员会共事过
Holland serves on the VA committee with her.

374
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,310
她找别人出手  好撇清干系
She used proxies to insulate herself.

375
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,640
你觉得是她把料爆给了他们
So you think that she gave the dirt to them.

376
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,960
没错  她在耍我们两个人
Yeah. She's been playing both of us.

377
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,750
你觉得她能拉到多少支持者
How many commitments do you think she could have?

378
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,920
目前也就20个左右吧
Around 20 so far.

379
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,440
那她还是被你俩远远甩在后面啊
So she's a distant third.

380
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,780
但她在一个个动摇我们的支持者啊
But she's picking people off us left and right.

381
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,330
你得帮我
I want your help.

382
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,180
我支持你啊  韦斯
You have my support, Wes.

383
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,570
那就公开表态
Then make that public.

384
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,180
如果我公开支持你  博奇就会支持韦伯
If I come out for you, Birch comes out for Webb.

385
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,740
那反倒会害你  而不是帮你
That's gonna hurt you, not help you.

386
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,190
情况很不妙  弗兰克
This is serious, Frank.

387
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,930
泰德·哈维梅耶在赞助她
Ted Havemeyer is bankrolling her.

388
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,540
你想过跟杰姬谈谈吗
Have you thought of talking to Jackie?

389
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,290
没有  原则上我不能那么做
No, no. I can't do that on principle.

390
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,090
为什么不行
Why not?

391
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,040
我不会跟哈维梅耶支持的人合作
Anyone who Havemeyer is backing, I don't work with.

392
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,260
我竞选参议员的时候  他也搅了我的局
He pulled the same crap on me when I ran for Senate.

393
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,960
他赞助我的主要对手  混蛋
He financed my primary opponent. Asshole.

394
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,120
那由你决定
Well, that is your call.

395
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,250
但如果你要让旧账阻碍你的竞选
But if you're gonna let an old grudge get in the way of progress --

396
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,780
我就是不能这么做  弗兰克
I just can't do it, Frank.

397
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,800
哈维梅耶这些年一直想把我赶下去
Havemeyer's been trying to shove me down the totem pole for years.

398
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,290
我不会让他得逞的
I won't give him the satisfaction.

399
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,240
我尊重你  但这样我就无能为力了
Well, I can respect that, but my hands are tied.

400
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,050
这件事很微妙
It's a delicate matter,

401
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,600
但我们正在和中国政府沟通
but we are in communication with the Chinese government

402
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,700
如何推进谈判
as to how to move forward.

403
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,500
那么美国将在网络攻击的事上屈服吗
Does this mean the U.S. will back down on cyber attacks?

404
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,280
美国从不屈服
The United States never backs down,

405
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,330
特别是在重要问题上
particularly on issues that are high priority to us.

406
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,430
国务卿女士  您是怎么
Madam Secretary, what did you--

407
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,220
谢谢
Thank you.

408
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,160
您是怎么跟代表团团长说的
What did you tell the head of the delegation?

409
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,050
代表团越界了
The delegation overstepped its bounds,

410
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,360
但凯茜不能坑她自己的人
but Cathy couldn't throw her own people under the bus.

411
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,990
她公开发表言论前该先跟我们商量一下
She should have consulted us first before speaking publicly.

412
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,270
媒体堵在她家门口
The press was on her doorstep

413
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,730
总统又在地球另一端
and the president was in another hemisphere.

414
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,740
我不是在批评她的做法
Now, look, I'm not condemning what she did,

415
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,340
但她总得采取措施
but she had to do something.

416
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,910
她凭直觉做决定  并采取了行动
She made a gut call and she acted.

417
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,780
咱们得撇清关系
We have to distance ourselves from this.

418
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,950
总统什么时候回来
When is the president back?

419
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,670
明天早上
Tomorrow morning.

420
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,860
我们能安排一次会面吗
Can we set up a meeting?

421
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,780
凯茜得公开道歉
Cathy needs to publicly apologize.

422
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,480
我们能让她跟总统谈谈吗
Can we get her in the room with the president?

423
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,800
我们不应该先统一一下步调吗
Shouldn't we all be on the same page first?

424
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,620
我再想想办法吧
I'll see what I can do.

425
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,760
谢谢
Thank you.

426
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,920
我去拿吃的之前  你问我了一个问题
Now, you asked me a question before I went and got my food.

427
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,860
副总统先生  我是麦金尼斯将军
Mr. Vice President. General McGinnis.

428
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,110
不胜荣幸  希望你不介意
it's a great honor. I hope you don't mind.

429
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,330
总统也想出席  他让我代为参加
The president wishes he could be here. He's asked me to fill in.

430
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,450
荣幸的是我  先生
The honor is mine, sir.

431
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,270
将军  这是我妻子  克莱尔
And, General, this is my wife, Claire.

432
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,730
很高兴见到你  克莱尔  好久不见
It's good to see you, Claire. It's been a long time.

433
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,660
是啊
Yes.

434
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,340
哈佛的同学
Harvard. We were classmates.

435
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,750
克莱尔没提过这事
Claire didn't say a thing.

436
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,360
我们还约会过
We dated for a time.

437
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,770
只有五分钟
About five minutes.

438
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,400
好了  不打扰你们用餐了
Anyway, I'll let you get back to your meal.

439
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,690
谢谢  我想起来了
Thank you. I've remembered.

440
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,750
有意思的是
Interestingly enough,

441
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,050
南卡罗莱纳州第一大作物不是棉花
in South Carolina the largest crop is not cotton.

442
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,970
而是烟草
No. It's tobacco.

443
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,080
第三大作物是大麻
And the third-largest crop is marijuana.

444
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,770
咱心里明白就好
Now -- we'll just keep that to ourselves.

445
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,020
失陪一下
Would you all excuse me for just a moment?

446
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,790
-只有她一个吗  -是的
- Is she alone? - Yes.

447
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,580
我们想单独谈谈
Would you give us a few moments, please?

448
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,330
怎么了
What's wrong?

449
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,310
是他
It was him.

450
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,730
谁
Who?

451
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,220
大一那年
Freshman year.

452
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,190
那件事...是麦金尼斯吗
You mean... McGinnis?

453
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,400
弗兰西斯  弗兰西斯  别做傻事
Francis, Francis. Please, don't do anything.

454
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
我绝不会给他授衔...
I am not gonna pin a medal on that --

455
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,660
你必须授衔
You have to.

456
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,250
等一下  不能让他
Just a minute, please! There is no way that man --

457
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,260
先生  典礼要开始了
Sir, they want to start the ceremony.

458
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,180
等一会儿  他不配接受...
Just a minute, please! He does not deserve a medal..

459
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,070
弗兰西斯  求你了
Francis. I beg of you.

460
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,210
我告诉你  枪毙他都不过分
I'm telling you, that man deserves to be taken out and shot.

461
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,250
我求你了
I am begging you.

462
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,850
-不行  -求你了
- No. - Please!

463
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,070
-不要  -别...
- No. - Do not --

464
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,550
我说等等
I said just a minute!

465
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,310
求你了  别惹事
Do not make a scene. Please.

466
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,880
汤姆
Tom.

467
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,200
谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming by.

468
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,790
我走进来时  我以为会有一丝怀念
You know, I thought I would miss this place the moment I stepped inside.

469
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,670
可是没有
But I don't.

470
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,600
喝斯黛拉没问题吧
Hope you like Stella.

471
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,880
干杯
Cheers.

472
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,810
干杯
Beers up.

473
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,950
你怎么样
How are things?

474
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,530
还不错  还不错
They're good. They're good.

475
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,690
你开心吗
You're happy?

476
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,150
我就没开心过
I haven't been happy a day in my life.

477
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,020
不过现在有时间了
But I have time now.

478
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,660
可以思考  写作  我最近在构思小说
To think. To write. Been working on a novel.

479
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,140
是吗
Yeah?

480
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,250
纯粹是狗屁  不过还凑合
It's absolute shit. That's okay.

481
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,580
挺好的  汤姆  真挺好的
That's great, Tom. That's really great.

482
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,600
有什么事
What's on your mind?

483
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,750
找我来不是叙旧的吧
I know you didn't ask me here just to catch up.

484
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,580
弗兰克·安德伍德
Frank Underwood.

485
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,560
我万分荣幸地
On the president's behalf

486
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,110
代表总统  授予艾莉西娅·汉普顿将军
it is my great honor to formerly recognize the selection

487
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,050
美军欧洲司令部
of General Alicia Hampton as Commander,

488
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,260
司令一职
United States European Command,

489
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,910
授予道顿·麦金尼斯将军
and General Dalton McGinnis

490
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,380
美国战略司令部司令一职
as Commander of the United States Strategic Command.

491
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,010
两位模范领袖为美国海军陆战队
The United States Marine Corps has been well served

492
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,720
做出了卓越贡献
by these two exemplary leaders.

493
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,220
总统与我希望两位再接再厉
The president and I are grateful for their continued service.

494
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,480
恭喜你
Congratulations.

495
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,570
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

496
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,620
你觉得我疯了吗
You think I'm insane?

497
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,170
我不觉得你疯了
I don't think you're insane.

498
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,700
只是经历了太多痛苦
I think you've been through a lot.

499
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,270
想探个究竟
Trying to make sense of it all.

500
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,500
我知道我是对的
I know I'm right.

501
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,650
那是自然
I'm sure I believe you are.

502
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,590
酒驾的事的确是他掩盖的
It's a fact that he helped cover up the DUI.

503
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,550
如果你手下的记者拿着这事来找你
Imagine if one of your reporters came to you with this story.

504
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,960
你会登出去吗
Could you print a word of it?

505
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,650
不会  但我会要求他们继续调查
No, but I'd have them keep digging.

506
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,330
是吗
Would you?

507
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,760
凭心而论
If you're honest with yourself,

508
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,770
你不会说这故事太牵强了吗
wouldn't you tell them it seemed farfetched?

509
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,280
笔记说明不了什么
Your notes aren't convincing.

510
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,580
警方报告也证实不了什么
The police reports don't prove a link.

511
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,200
-还有你的妄加猜测  -我知道
- And the speculative leaps you're making... - I know.

512
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,390
律人要先律己
Hold yourself to the same standards as you hold your staff.

513
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,610
你当时在和佐伊约会
You and Zoe were seeing each other.

514
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,790
我是猜的  也许错了
I -- I'm assuming. Maybe I'm wrong.

515
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,150
是在约会
We -- we were.

516
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,230
第一任妻子去世时  我也接受不了
When I lost my first wife, it didn't add up.

517
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,360
谁会在31岁就死于乳腺癌呢
Who dies of breast cancer at 31?

518
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,570
我想起诉  告医生  医院  所有人
I wanted to sue. Doctors, the hospital, everyone.

519
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,390
觉得他们在隐瞒什么
Thought they were hiding something.

520
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,790
但没有
No.

521
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,730
悲伤让人想要答案  但有时真的就没有
Grief demands an answer, but sometimes there isn't one.

522
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,640
没人能挽救她  就是这样
Her life couldn't be saved. Period.

523
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,870
我该怎么办
What do I do?

524
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,800
你愿找人谈谈吗
Would you consider seeing someone?

525
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,550
辛西娅去世时有个治疗师帮了我很多
There's a therapist who helped me a great deal when Cynthia passed away.

526
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,150
我可以帮你联系...
I can put you in touch --

527
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,950
不了  我不用见谁
No. I don't need to see somebody.

528
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,260
卢卡斯
Lucas.

529
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,020
很感谢你过来  汤姆
I appreciate you coming by, Tom.

530
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,770
也谢谢你的啤酒
Thanks for the beer.

531
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,470
随时联系我吧
You call me anytime.

532
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,210
照顾好自己  卢卡斯
You take care of yourself, Lucas.

533
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,410
我是认真的
I mean it.

534
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,060
还打算去哪吗  先生
Any plans to go elsewhere, sir?

535
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,180
不了  我们今晚不出去了  谢谢
No. We're in for the night. Thank you.

536
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,830
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

537
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,840
我累了
I'm tired.

538
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,890
需要什么吗  先生
Do you need something, sir?

539
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,990
我的遥控手柄  我想玩游戏
Uh, my remote. I want to play.

540
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,300
就在这儿
It's right over here.

541
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,990
谢谢
Thank you.

542
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,730
网络出问题了吗  我上不了线
Is there something wrong with the Internet? I can't get online.

543
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,160
我们封掉了连接
We had to disable the access.

544
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,430
那个连接不安全
It's not a secure connection.

545
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,880
能让我单独待会儿吗
Could you just give me a moment, please?

546
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,160
只要您在外面  身边就得有人
Whenever you're out here, somebody needs to be with you.

547
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,770
我在自家后院都不能独自待着吗
I can't be alone in my own backyard?

548
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,210
我说了算倒可以  但我说了不算
If it were up to me, sir. But it's not up to me.

549
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,180
好吧  密查姆
Okay, Meechum.

550
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,760
你以为我不想摔东西吗
You think I don't want to smash things?

551
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,630
我的愤怒是你无法想象的
I know what that anger is more than you can imagine.

552
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,410
他压着我的时候...
When he was on top of me --

553
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,680
我们不需要说这个
We don't have to talk about it.

554
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,190
不  我想说
No, I want to.

555
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,250
他压着我的时候  我使劲推
When he was on top of me, I pressed my hand --

556
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,610
用尽全力推他的脸
with everything I could I pressed it into his face.

557
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,270
我使足了劲  弄伤了他的鼻子
I pressed it so hard I broke his nose.

558
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,530
但那没能阻止他
That didn't stop him.

559
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,480
他把床单塞进我嘴里
He shoved the sheets in my mouth.

560
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,170
我几乎无法呼吸
I could barely breathe.

561
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,910
每次我想起那个女孩
Every time I think of her

562
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,220
被人那样按倒
pinned down like that

563
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,630
我都会勒死她  弗朗西斯
I strangle her, Francis,

564
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,860
这样她才不会勒死我
so she doesn't strangle me.

565
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,190
我必须那样  我们必须那样
I have to. We have to.

566
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,480
否则...
The alternative is --

567
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,850
我无法忍受
it's unlivable.

568
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,390
你该休息了
You should go to sleep.

569
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,140
我不知道能不能睡着
I'm not sure if I can.

570
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,600
那你就回楼下去
Then you should go back downstairs.

571
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,910
早晨的时候  恨意也不会消退
You'll still feel the hate in the morning.

572
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,590
你会利用那份恨意  但不是去报复他
You'll use that. But not on him.

573
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,390
你到底说了什么
What did you communicate, exactly?

574
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,020
我让他提起议事日程的事
I told him to bring up the agenda,

575
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,110
指出战略对话的关键点  但别提要求
suggest bullet points for the SED, but make no demands.

576
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,570
那怎么会被理解成最后通牒
And how did that translate into a direct ultimatum?

577
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,740
有时我的代表会探究言外之意
Well, sometimes my delegates try to read between the lines.

578
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,490
他们知道我为外交目的需要合理推卸责任
They know that I need plausible deniability for diplomatic purposes.

579
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,900
那你为什么没有立刻否认
Why didn't you immediately recant?

580
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,660
就我跟中国人打交道的经验看
In my experience with the Chinese,

581
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,260
变卦会让他们觉得我们软弱
backpedaling makes us look weak.

582
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,910
我当时有两个选择  丢脸或展示实力
I had two choices: Lose face or exhibit strength.

583
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,540
我选择了后者
I chose the latter.

584
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,550
好吧  凯瑟琳  我会很快跟你联系
All right, Catherine. I'll be in touch shortly.

585
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,500
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

586
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,320
用我的私人线路打给雷蒙德
Get me Raymond on the private line.

587
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,390
你觉得她是故意越界的吗
Do you think she overstepped on purpose?

588
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,220
凯茜绝不会违反你的指令  不会故意违反
Cathy would never disobey your orders. Not on purpose.

589
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,340
雷蒙德  弗兰克在我这儿
Raymond, I've got Frank here.

590
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,610
就我们三个吗
Just the three of us?

591
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,200
就三个  早上好  雷蒙德
Just us three. Morning, Raymond.

592
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
我在北京的联系人
My contacts in Beijing

593
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,540
跟我说商务部部长很激动
tell me the minister of commerce is in a tizzy.

594
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,910
他想以此为借口重拳出击
Wants to use this as an excuse to start clenching fists.

595
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,560
我要么拆凯茜的台  要么支持她
Well, either I turn my back on Cathy or I stand behind her.

596
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,650
选前者
It's gotta be the former.

597
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,610
我同意
I agree.

598
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,880
如果您不道歉
If you don't apologize,

599
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,570
那就不是小矛盾  而是大摩擦了
you go from ruffling feathers to plucking them.

600
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,890
中国人绝不会忍气吞声  总统先生
And the Chinese won't stand for that, Mr. President.

601
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,510
说是我跟内阁之间意思传达有错误如何
What about perceived miscommunication between me and my cabinet?

602
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,350
总统先生  现在的目标是继续谈判
Mr. President, right now the goal is to resume the talks.

603
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,950
就别担心他们是怎么想的了
I wouldn't worry about perceptions.

604
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,350
弗兰克没错  我们得现实点
Frank is right. We need to be pragmatic.

605
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,000
先别担心场面上的事
Worry about appearances later.

606
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,760
行  我让凯瑟琳拟一份致歉信
All right. I'll have Catherine draft an apology.

607
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,960
不  必须由您亲自写  总统先生
No, it has to come from you, Mr. President.

608
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,860
道歉要有份量
If the apology is to mean anything,

609
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,580
就得由白宫出面
it must come from the White House.

610
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,110
这样的确应该更有成效
That is certainly the more likely to succeed.

611
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,050
行  那我亲自写  谢谢  雷蒙德
Fine. I'll do it then. Thank you, Raymond.

612
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,200
谢谢你  加勒特
Thank you, Garrett.

613
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,340
你听到他仍然直呼总统的名字吗
Do you hear how he still uses the president's given name?

614
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,180
而沃克也毫不在意他的失敬
And that Walker doesn't flinch at the lack of respect it implies.

615
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,180
先生  恕我直言
Sir, forgive me if this isn't the case,

616
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,520
您好像有点犹豫
but you seem a bit hesitant.

617
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,560
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

618
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,000
关于公众看法的事  您所言极是
Well, you've raised a good point about public perception.

619
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,750
我不想让您觉得
I don't want you to think that

620
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,520
我对您的担忧毫不在意
I'm dismissing your concerns casually.

621
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,910
没有  你也担心这个吗
No. It's a concern for you, too?

622
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,560
凯茜提出的观点不无道理
There is some insight into what Cathy brought up.

623
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,160
变卦就是软弱
Backpedalling is weakness.

624
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,990
跟中国人合作总是碰运气
Well, it's always a coin toss with the Chinese.

625
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,130
但有时候坚定立场比让步妥协要好
But sometimes standing your ground is better than giving in.

626
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,160
你强势  他们反而更尊重你
They respect you more when you show strength.

627
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,240
你改主意了吗  弗兰克
Are you changing your mind on this, Frank?

628
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,590
我只是觉得  您该按自己的心意决定
I just think it's important that you do what you think is best.

629
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,460
美国人民选您当总统
The American people voted you president.

630
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,990
不是我  也不是雷蒙德·塔斯克
Not me. Not Raymond Tusk.

631
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,330
我决定了再告诉你
I'll let you know what I decide.

632
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,140
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, sir.

633
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,170
你觉得安德伍德选的是她吗
You think she's Underwood's choice?

634
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,160
他没直说  所以有可能
He deflected, so it's possible.

635
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,940
你和我
You and I,

636
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,980
我们得合作  韦斯
we need to work together on this, Wes.

637
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,100
否则我们俩都得完蛋
Before we both get screwed.

638
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,030
我同意
I agree.

639
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,000
我们中一个人退出
One of us drops out,

640
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,280
支持另一个人
throws support to the other.

641
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,490
这就能削弱她的支持力量
That'll dwarf any following she has.

642
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,490
你想让我退出吗
You want me to drop out.

643
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,000
我一定任命你做众议院拨款委员会主席
I'll make sure you get my chairmanship on appropriations.

644
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,680
你至多能任命我做纪律委员会主席  这没人稀罕
All you can offer me is, uh, Ethics, which nobody wants.

645
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,800
我们把事定下来吧  韦斯
Let's put this to bed, Wes.

646
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,820
韦伯肯定跟他谈了协议
Webb must have offered him a deal.

647
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,380
那我们就提出更好的条件
Then we have to offer a better one.

648
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,160
我猜是拨款委员会  我给不了更好的
I'm guessing appropriations. There's no way I can top that.

649
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,830
除非是财政委员会
Except for ways and means.

650
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,550
我不能让你把职位给巴克沃特这样的混蛋
I -- I won't let you give your chair to an ass like Buchwalter.

651
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,380
如果你是党鞭
If you're the Whip,

652
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,640
你地位比他  和其他主席都高
you outrank him and every other chairman.

653
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,400
去他的委员会
Screw committees.

654
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,510
我能直接跟议长交流
I'll have a direct line to the speaker.

655
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,940
别固执了  杰姬
Don't be stubborn, Jackie.

656
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,780
你觉得他会接受吗
You think he'd take it?

657
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,810
他连韦伯的条件都愿意接受
He was willing to take a deal from Webb.

658
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,130
但你是他最讨厌的人
But you're the only person he hates more.

659
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,780
他很蛮人  但不是傻子
He's a brute. But he's not an idiot.

660
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,530
我知道你不是出于忠诚而拒绝
Well, I know you're not refusing out of loyalty.

661
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,400
没错
True.

662
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,320
所以是泰德的缘故
So it's because of Ted.

663
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,070
你觉得自己很厉害  对吧
You think you are hot shit, don't you?

664
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,070
我们能放下架子  像成年人那样谈正经事吗
Can we set egos aside and talk business like the adults we are?

665
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,420
我想要的不只是财政委员会主席之位
I want more than ways and means.

666
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,110
说吧
Tell me.

667
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,050
我要哈维梅耶走人  不只是退休
I want Havemeyer gone. Not just retired....

668
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,100
让他从政坛消失
Politically dead.

669
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,940
竞选是12年前的事了
That race was 12 years ago.

670
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,960
不是他  我也能当12年参议员了
That was 12 years I could have been in the Senate.

671
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,320
你就想报复  真的吗
Revenge? Really?

672
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,010
不是报复
Not revenge.

673
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,520
是报应
Equity.

674
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,240
那你准备怎么办
Well, what are you gonna do?

675
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,500
巴克沃特不会让步的
Buchwalter won't budge.

676
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,770
我这一生最鄙视小气之人
You know, there's nothing I despise more in life than pettiness.

677
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,380
我可以去找韦伯  但我给不了他什么
I could approach Webb, but I don't have enough to offer him.

678
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,120
他不会退选的  他自尊心太强
Ah, he'd never drop out. Too much pride.

679
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
我不知道该怎么办
I'm not sure what to do.

680
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,390
这是泰德的档案  他有个私生女
This is my file on Ted. An illegitimate daughter.

681
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,870
和保姆生的
The nanny, of course.

682
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,680
她叫艾米莉·罗德里格斯  19岁了
Her name is Emily Rodriguez. 19.

683
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,820
患脑中风
Cerebral palsy.

684
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,860
我知道艾米莉的事
I know about Emily.

685
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,420
那我们还在这里讨论什么
Well, then why are we having this conversation?

686
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,590
这说来话长
It's complicated.

687
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,350
私生女  我没看出有什么复杂的
The daughter? It's very black and white to me.

688
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,530
我跟泰德是一辈子的交情
I've known Ted since I was born.

689
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,100
他跟我父亲是好友
He and my father were very close.

690
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,960
是的  我知道
Yeah, I'm aware.

691
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,500
他一直都对我关照有加
He's always looked out for me.

692
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,810
他把我送进西点军校  资助我第一次竞选
He got me into West Point. He funded my first race.

693
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,800
我喜欢泰德  他一直都很有团队精神
I like Ted. He's always been a team player.

694
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,820
很不幸  他拥有这样的秘密
It's unfortunate he has this secret.

695
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,990
这是个错误  他一直都很后悔
It was a mistake. One he's always regretted.

696
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,160
她出生之后  他让我去探望她
After she was born he asked me to check in on her,

697
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,050
因为他自己做不到  而他信任我
because he couldn't. Because he trusted me.

698
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
我懂了
I see.

699
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,110
你来这里的时候就知道你该做什么
You came in here knowing what you had to do,

700
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,220
但还是希望我能变个戏法  你就不用那么做了
hoping I would pull a rabbit out of a hat so you wouldn't have to.

701
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,660
我认识这姑娘
I know the girl.

702
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,330
我认识她母亲  她们不该经受那种事
I know her mother. These people don't deserve this.

703
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,830
我该支的招都支了
I've given you all I can.

704
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,440
你要如何决定是你自己的事
Whatever you decide is your prerogative.

705
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,430
但也许我错看了你
But maybe I misjudged you.

706
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,220
泰德对我来说就像家人一样
Ted is family to me.

707
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,830
用来取代亲生女儿的养女
An adopted daughter in lieu of a real one.

708
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,480
先生  国务卿来了
Sir, the secretary is here.

709
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,050
谢谢  让她进来  你下去吧
Thank you. Send her in. Excuse us.

710
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,330
很好
It's good.

711
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,360
是不是太长了
Not too long?

712
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,620
有一点  但也还好
A little bit, but not much.

713
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,150
这部分  第三段
This part, three paragraphs in.

714
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,230
关于电话公司吗
Oh, about the phone companies?

715
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,950
多跟我讲讲
Tell me more.

716
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,530
这是国土安全部的主要担忧之一
It's one of Homeland Security's major concerns.

717
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,130
网络攻击会渗透电话运营商
That the cyber attacks might infiltrate phone carriers,

718
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,290
得到数百万人的数据记录
get access to millions of people's data history.

719
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,380
比如他们跟谁通过电话吗
Like who they called?

720
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,570
是的  跟谁通过电话  发过短信
Yeah, who they called, texted,

721
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,300
短信是什么内容
what they texted,

722
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,870
何时  何地  所有信息
when, where they were. Everything.

723
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,080
有这种可能吗
And that's possible?

724
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,030
目前没有严重的信息泄露事件
There haven't been any catastrophic breaches yet.

725
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,080
至少没有相关报道
At least not reported.

726
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,570
但是中国似乎已经开始
But it looks like the Chinese are starting to

727
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,220
在暗网上招募雇佣黑客
recruit mercenaries on the Deep Web

728
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,090
发动无法追踪的网络游击战
to launch guerilla-type attacks that can't be tracked back --

729
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,300
等一下  暗网  我听说过
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. The Deep Web. I've heard of that.

730
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,040
是的
Oh, yeah, yeah.

731
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,500
96%的网络内容无法通过
No, 96% of the internet isn't accessible

732
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,680
普通引擎搜索到  这其中大部分毫无价值
through standard search engines. Most of it's useless.

733
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,200
但是在那里你几乎可以找到任何东西
But it's where you go to find anything and everything.

734
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,960
儿童色情片  比特币洗钱  邮购麻醉剂
Child porn, Bitcoin laundering, mail-order narcotics,

735
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,120
雇佣黑客
hackers for hire.

736
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,060
怎么进入暗网
How do you access it?

737
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,810
其实很简单  你想看的话我可以演示
It's actually pretty easy. I could show you if you want.

738
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,130
好啊  我很好奇
Yeah, I'm curious.

739
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:02,760
我能不能...
Mind if I...?

740
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,510
请便
Go ahead.

741
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,810
好  首先你需要洋葱路由
Okay, first thing you need is TOR.

742
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,700
有些人喜欢隐形网  但我觉得洋葱路由更好
Some people prefer I2P, but I think TOR is better.

743
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,620
洋葱路由是什么
What is TOR?

744
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,950
它可以通过代理服务器保护你  让你匿名
It protects you through proxy servers. Keeps you anonymous.

745
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,450
接下来我来演示如何进入
Then I'll show you how to get to

746
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,120
论坛和即时聊天
the posting boards and the IRCs.

747
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,390
但我要提醒你  不要随便乱点
But I gotta warn you: Be careful what you click.

748
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,020
这上面有些很疯狂的东西
Some crazy shit there, man.

749
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,450
长久以来
For too long, uh, we've, uh,

750
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,520
我们对网络战一事小心翼翼
danced on egg shells regarding the issue of cyber warfare.

751
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,870
国务卿杜兰特
Now, Secretary Durant

752
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,890
是按照我的指令行事
acted on instructions that came directly from me.

753
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,680
如果中国没有诚意
Now, if the Chinese are not willing to

754
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,140
进行一场有意义的对话
engage in a meaningful dialogue

755
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,970
探讨美国公司的知识产权
about intellectual property of American corporations

756
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,330
以及对我政府网络设施的
as well as this deliberate targeting

757
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,460
蓄意攻击
of our government's online infrastructure,

758
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,140
那就证明他们抱有一种双重标准的心态
well then that is proof of a double-standard mentality

759
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,370
而我们将不再容忍这种心态
that we shall no longer tolerate.

760
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,480
我们派往商贸联合委员会的代表
Our delegation to the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade

761
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,730
遭到了美国政府代表的
was unfairly accused and defamed

762
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,820
不公平指控与污蔑
by representatives of the United States government.

763
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,470
中华人民共和国
The People's Republic of China

764
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,040
不会受
will not be threatened

765
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,780
荒谬而未经证实的指控所胁迫
by derisive and unsubstantiated claims.

766
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,980
如果白宫还要继续如此行事
As long as the White House continues to behave this way,

767
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,550
那么将来任何的双边贸易对话都是不可能的
any future bilateral trade talks will be impossible.

768
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,000
我也觉得大吃一惊
It caught me by surprise, too.

769
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,180
昨天我挂电话之后  你又对他说什么了吗
Did you say anything to him after I hung up yesterday?

770
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,030
没有  你跟他谈过了吗
No. Have you spoken to him?

771
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,380
是的  几分钟前
Yeah, a few minutes ago.

772
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,900
他说他做了他认为该做的事
He said he did what he thought was right.

773
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,950
这我们没法反驳
Well, there's nothing we can do to combat that.

774
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,460
他一般不会招呼都不打
He doesn't usually go against my advice

775
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,060
就违背我的建议
without giving me fair warning.

776
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,830
你什么意思  雷蒙德
What are you suggesting, Raymond?

777
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,020
他容易受人操纵
He's easily manipulated.

778
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,490
这次不是
Clearly not in this case.

779
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,160
这问题必须解决  就指望你了  弗兰克
We need to fix this. And I'm counting on you for that, Frank.

780
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,360
我再说一遍  我不欠你什么
Let me freshen your memory. I don't owe you any favors.

781
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,540
我答应跟你合作  不是给你卖力
I promised to work with you, not for you.

782
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,810
对于中国的问题  我们的目标一样
And when it comes to China, we both want the same thing.

783
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,260
所以得合作
So we need to work together.

784
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,300
说服加勒特撤回言论
To convince Garrett he should retract.

785
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,610
是支持总统的选择
To support the president in the path that he's chosen.

786
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,450
他可是在公然挑衅
While he continues to antagonize them publicly.

787
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,560
现在他支持率大增  这对他有利
While he continues to benefit from a bump in approval ratings.

788
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,840
对中的强硬政策很吃香
A tough stance on China is popular.

789
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,800
这点可以加以利用
And we can use that to our advantage.

790
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,910
耐心点
Let's just be patient

791
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,980
我看看我能不能通过私下接触缓和事态
and see if we can smooth things over from back channels.

792
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,170
我的耐心是有限的  尽快让我看到成果
If I don't see any results, you won't have my patience for long.

793
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,200
我知道了
That's understood.

794
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,360
杜兰特的话记得告诉我
Let me know what Durant has to say.

795
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,300
当然
Absolutely.

796
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,380
谢谢你  副总统先生
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

797
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,060
我以为他不会愿意接受我的恩惠呢
I thought he might balk at taking a handout from me.

798
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,090
这可不是小恩小惠
I'd call it more than a handout.

799
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,720
他向来不难收买
Well, he's always been the sort of man

800
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,820
只是代价一直很大
who could be bought, but never cheaply.

801
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,160
赢得他的不是主席位子  泰德
It's not the chairmanship that bought him, Ted.

802
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,900
什么意思
What do you mean?

803
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,410
我现在告诉你
I'm telling you this

804
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,250
是给你时间跟你妻子谈
so that you have time to call your wife

805
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,680
并且准备发言稿
and prepare your statement.

806
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,110
我怎么脱身  他要干什么
What's my out? What does he want from me?

807
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,620
脱不了  他就想伤你
There is no out. He wants it to hurt.

808
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,110
你跟他说的
You told him.

809
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,810
我只是说可以办到
I just promised him that I could make it happen.

810
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,960
你不能这么做  杰姬
You can't do this, Jackie.

811
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,980
明天报道就见报
The story's breaking tomorrow.

812
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,080
哪部分
What part of it?

813
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,920
不提名字  只说你有私生女
No names. Just that you have a daughter.

814
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,210
你想没想过这对戴安的影响  对我们的儿子
Have you thought about what this will do to Diane? To our sons?

815
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,180
我并不觉得光彩
I hate myself for it.

816
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,070
可是我能撑过去
But I'll get over that.

817
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,740
那她呢
What about her?

818
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,030
艾米莉  你连名字都不敢说吗
Emily. You can't even say her name, can you?

819
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:34,750
少教育我
Don't lecture me.

820
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,630
你都没跟她共处过
You've never been in the same room with her.

821
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,950
我给她提供了最好的医疗条件
She's had the best treatment available.

822
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,720
一个人  满身的仪器连线
Alone. Hooked up to machines.

823
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,940
晚饭之后就没有护士了
Surrounded by nurses who punch out at dinnertime.

824
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,150
你不知道我有多难过
You don't know what I've been through.

825
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,180
你  那她呢
You? What about her?

826
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,830
我已经尽力了
I can't do more than I've done.

827
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,340
胡说  泰德  你有办法的
That's bullshit, Ted. You could've found a way.

828
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,140
我不会向你为自己辩护
I won't defend myself to you.

829
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,080
不用  跟你老婆说吧
Don't. Save that for your wife.

830
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,840
我不是要惩罚你  泰德
This isn't to punish you, Ted.

831
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,420
比那简单
It's -- it's simpler than that.

832
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,410
当初我鼓励你参选
When I first encouraged you to run for office,

833
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,070
是觉得你不达目的不罢休
it's because I sensed how unstoppable you were.

834
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:14,080
可没想到连我你都可以牺牲
But I never thought I'd have to lie down on the tracks myself.

835
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,320
你要是想弄死我
If you're going to put my neck in the noose,

836
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,480
动手时要看着我的眼睛
look me in the eye while you do it.

837
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,520
你对我的付出我很感激
I'm very grateful for all that you've done for me.

838
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,970
你能做个好党鞭  杰奎琳
You'll make an excellent whip, Jacqueline.

839
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,290
滚出我的办公室吧
Now please get out of my office.

840
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,730
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

841
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,730
终于清静了
It's finally quiet.

842
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,690
可不是吗
It is, isn't it?

843
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,270
这是咱俩的堡垒了
We have our fortress now.

844
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,690
你去哪了
Where are you coming from?

845
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:30,260
新办公室  今天刚布置完
My new office. They just finished setting it up today.

846
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,200
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

847
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,090
就是间办公室  凑合吧
It's an office. It's fine.

峰会举行前  美国媒体普遍认为网络安全将成为会晤焦点问题
从2013年初  美国政府和国会中的外交界鹰派便一直要求白宫
在网络安全上向中国施压  采取强硬立场
可就在"庄园峰会"举行前一天  英国《卫报》首次向外界披露了
美国国家安全局大规模搜集民众通讯记录的"棱镜计划"
从那时起到现在的九个多月内
美国情报机构的秘密文件仍在源源不断地被媒体披露出来
美国政府也一直忙于向世界其它国家解释自己的监听计划
再也顾不上就网络安全问题上对中国指手画脚

负责指派接替奥巴马参议员职务的伊利诺伊州长
试图私下叫卖这个肥缺  结果事情败露  最后锒铛入狱

而鲍卡斯赴任北京后留下的参议院财政委员会主席的位置由谁来接任

据美国媒体报道  帮助鲍卡斯获得驻华大使空缺的正是他的老朋友副总统拜登
