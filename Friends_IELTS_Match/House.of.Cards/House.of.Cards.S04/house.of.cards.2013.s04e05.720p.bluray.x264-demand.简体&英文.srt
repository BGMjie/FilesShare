00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,040
我读过你写的一些书  总统先生
I've read some of your books, Mr. President.

147
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,620
我刚读完《学会学习》
I just finished Learning to Learn.

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,860
很不错
It was good.

149
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
谢谢
Thank you.

150
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,780
有一章关于想象的令我很感兴趣
There was a chapter on visualization that really interested me.

151
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,770
是的  是学生可用的工具  帮助他们
Yes, it's a... A tool for students. It helps them--

152
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,170
我想请你想象一下
I would like you to visualize something.

153
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,050
你站在苔原上
Now, you're standing in the tundra.

154
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,690
大风  暴雪
Um, wind, snow...

155
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,800
机器在钻透冰层
machines drilling through the ice,

156
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,400
长长的管线延伸至远处的地平线  你能想象吗
long pipelines stretching to the horizon. Do you see?

157
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,160
如果你想谈西伯利亚  我很乐意...
If you want to talk about Siberia, I'm more than happy to--

158
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,400
不不  你不是在想象
No, no, no. You're not visualizing,

159
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,010
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

160
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,520
闭上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

161
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,800
好吧  闭上了
All right. They're closed.

162
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,540
很好  那么
Good. Now...

163
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,140
想象工人
picture the men

164
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,290
在钻井和管线上工作
working those drills and pipelines.

165
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,090
他们什么样
What do they look like?

166
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,080
大棉衣  戴手套  穿着靴子
Um, heavy coats, gloves, boots.

167
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
他们是
Are they...

168
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,310
中国人吗
Chinese?

169
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,570
瞧  当我想象的时候
You see, when I picture this,

170
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,730
我看不到中国人
I don't see Chinese.

171
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,610
我同意  中国的控制权越少越好
I agree with you. The less control the Chinese have, the better.

172
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,840
那你为什么把米尔金送去中国
Then why did you send Milkin to China?

173
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,610
你不肯跟我们谈判
You weren't negotiating with us.

174
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,830
我们觉得或许他们的运气会更好
We thought they might have more luck.

175
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,430
他们的要求会让我们陷入比之前更糟的境地
Their demands would leave us worse off than we were before.

176
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,540
我可以让国际货币基金组织拿出一半的救市资金
I can get the IMF to provide half the bailout.

177
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,940
这可以制衡中国对开采权的要求
This would counteract the Chinese demands for drilling rights--

178
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,400
你是想挑拨我们
You are playing us off each other.

179
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,550
总统先生
Mr. President--

180
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,510
我觉得  你是自不量力了  布莱斯先生
I think you're in over your head, Mr. Blythe.

181
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,030
容我解释一下
If you would just give me a chance to elaborate--

182
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,230
凭什么让你解释
Why give you a chance?

183
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,800
你对俄罗斯  对中国有什么了解
What do you know about Russia? About China?

184
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,930
我已经听过了...
I've been briefed on--

185
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,320
抱歉  但是
Forgive me, but, uh...

186
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,930
我不愿跟
I don't feel comfortable

187
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,180
总统以外的人进行谈判
negotiating with anyone other than the president.

188
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,510
等他康复  或许我们可以谈谈
When he recovers, perhaps he and I can speak.

189
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,670
我们完事了吗
So, are we finished?

190
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,570
总统情况很糟
The president's in very bad shape.

191
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,600
先生
Sir...

192
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,480
多严重
How serious is it?

193
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
他需要肝脏移植
He needs a liver transplant.

194
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,370
我不知道
I wasn't aware that...

195
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,490
你最好习惯跟我磋商
You better get used to negotiating with me.

196
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,890
如果总统死了  那就是你和我
If the president dies, it's you and I...

197
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,600
否则没得可谈
or nothing at all.

198
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,050
抱歉  总统先生
My apologies, Mr. President.

199
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,400
我无意侮辱你
I didn't intend to insult you.

200
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,830
我们继续协商  我只求这个
Let's keep a dialogue open. That's all I'm asking.

201
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,960
我想给你一份应对中方要求的
I'd like the opportunity to present you with a detailed proposal

202
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,460
具体提议
countering the Chinese demands.

203
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,340
我会让国务卿杜兰特跟你的外交部长接洽
I'll have Secretary Durant work with your foreign minister,

204
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,890
然后我们再谈
and then we'll take it from there.

205
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,150
这样可以吗
Are you open to that?

206
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,470
当然
Of course.

207
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,840
我很期待看到你的提议
I look forward to reviewing your proposal.

208
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,510
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

209
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,620
先生  这消息我们还不希望透露出去
Sir, we didn't want that to get out to the press yet.

210
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,240
美国人民反正也该知道
The American people deserve to know, anyway.

211
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,320
先生  俄罗斯人是见软就欺
Sir, the Russians don't respond well to weakness.

212
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,890
现在他们知道总统...
Now that they know that the president--

213
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,100
你听到他说愿意协商了
You heard him say he's open to negotiation.

214
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,190
我认为这是进展
I'd say that's progress.

215
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,350
四天了  还没有吗
Four days and still nothing?

216
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,250
没有记者招待会  没有通报
No press conference, no briefing.

217
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,130
我们得让他们
We have to let them conduct

218
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,550
按自己的步调进行调查
their investigation on their own terms.

219
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,180
感觉好像我们被蒙在鼓里
Feels like we're being shut out.

220
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,220
不仅仅是联调局
This isn't just the bureau.

221
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,540
他们还得跟国土安全部协调
They have to coordinate with Homeland

222
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,000
-确保敏感...  -扯淡
- and make sure nothing sensitive-- - That's bullshit.

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,160
古德温有什么情况你不希望我们知道
There's something about Goodwin that you don't want us to know.

224
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,060
不对
Wrong.

225
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,740
我跟你一样想知道他这么做的动机
I wanna know why he did this just as much as you do...

226
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,080
但我们得让联调局做他们的工作
But we've gotta let the FBI do its job.

227
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,820
跟我去看他时是同一个论调
Same theory as when I visited him.

228
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
那是他达成认罪协议之前  是吗
And that was before he struck the plea, correct?

229
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,080
我鼓励他认罪的
I encouraged him to plead guilty.

230
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,360
他的宣称毫无依据
His claims were unsubstantiated.

231
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,750
跟我们说说你去见古德温之前
Tell us about your meeting with the president

232
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,360
跟总统的见面
prior to that meeting with Goodwin.

233
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,500
卢卡斯拜托我调查  我就调查了
Lucas asked me to investigate. I did.

234
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,000
因此采访了安德伍德
That involved an interview with Underwood.

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,370
你还留着笔记吗
You still have your notes?

236
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,050
没有搜查令我不会交出笔记
No notes without a warrant.

237
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,460
媒体  没日没夜地打
The press. Calling non-stop.

238
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,210
我们建议调查期间你不要跟任何人...
We suggest you don't speak to anyone while we're still--

239
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,130
别担心  我完全不想被扯进来
Don't worry. I don't have any interest in getting dragged into this.

240
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,250
我去把笔记找出来
Let me go dig up those notes.

241
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,500
布莱斯  他告诉佩特罗夫总统需要移植
Blythe... He told Petrov the president needs a transplant.

242
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,410
他为什么要那么做
Why would he do that?

243
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,000
佩特罗夫把他气到了
Petrov got under his skin.

244
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,740
这就是为什么我们本该按你丈夫的计划来
This is why we should've carried out your husband's plan.

245
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,170
我们给了莫斯科太多操作的空间
We're giving Moscow too much room to maneuver--

246
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,130
我们别谈论无法改变的事了  道格
Let's not debate what we can't change, Doug.

247
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,880
如果莫斯科知道了  我们就得通知媒体
If Moscow knows, we'll have to notify the press.

248
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,610
我们明天就说
We're doing that tomorrow.

249
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,650
由萨克逊医生来做通告
Dr. Saxon will do the briefing.

250
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,670
不  我来吧
No, I'll do it.

251
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,580
还是由第一夫人来说的好
It's better coming from the First Lady.

252
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,920
我同意
I agree.

253
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,340
这事我们也得应对一下
We need to address this, too.

254
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,810
联调局在古德温家找到了他的遗书
The FBI found Goodwin's notes in his house.

255
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,510
可以给处理掉吗
Can we make them disappear?

256
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,950
不行  已经被收为证据了
No, it's already been catalogued.

257
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,360
我们得先一步采取行动控制舆论
We need to get out ahead of it and control the story.

258
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,340
好吧  给我弄一份目前为止的调查报告
All right. Get me a copy and report on the investigation so far.

259
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,050
我想见他
I wanna see him.

260
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,410
总统
The president.

261
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,270
特勤局不许我进去
The Secret Service still won't let me.

262
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,940
请允许斯坦普先生见我丈夫
I'd like Mr. Stamper to have access to my husband, please.

263
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,700
我们有严格命令  夫人  只有您
We have strict orders, ma'am. Only you and--

264
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,070
需要我亲自打给副总统吗
Would you like me to call the vice president myself?

265
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,930
道格拉斯  这位年轻人会送你进去
Douglas, this young man will escort you to his room.

266
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,970
谢谢
Thank you.

267
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,950
-几点了  -7点刚过
- What time is it? - It's a little past 7:00.

268
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,540
先生  先生  是道格
Sir? Sir, it's Doug.

269
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,940
虽然他睁开了眼
Just because his eyes are open

270
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,800
但不代表他的意识完全清醒了
doesn't mean he's fully conscious.

271
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,430
肝功能不足
Insufficient liver function.

272
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,520
他的大脑泡在一堆未处理的氨中
His brain is swimming in a pool of unprocessed ammonia.

273
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,580
如果他能看到什么  大概也是严重的幻觉
If he's seeing anything, it's probably severe hallucinations.

274
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,310
他多久能得到肝脏
How long until he has a liver?

275
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,900
可能得要几小时  可能要几天
Could be hours. Could be days.

276
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,600
他是名单上第三位
He's number three on the list.

277
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,290
第三名
Number three?

278
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,050
名单按需排序
It's prioritized in terms of need

279
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,980
他是1号情况的第一位
and who was listed first as a Status 1.

280
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,070
他是美国总统啊
He's the President of the United States.

281
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,390
这是法律
It's the law.

282
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,480
司法部长要辞职
The attorney general is resigning.

283
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,790
把这条加入今天下午的新闻发布稿中
Add that to the press release for this afternoon.

284
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,250
-是她的决定还是副总统的  -我的决定
- Uh, her decision or the vice president's? - My decision.

285
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,450
古德温的证人保护计划是司法部的责任
Goodwin's WITSEC was a DOJ responsibility.

286
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,870
我们得找人背锅
We needed a head to roll.

287
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,490
先是她
First hers...

288
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,690
然后你
then yours.

289
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,460
你明天辞职
You'll resign tomorrow.

290
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,640
道格  我知道你现在压力很大  但是
Doug, I know you're under a lot of pressure, but--

291
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,700
是你发了那张南军士兵照片
You sent the photo of the rebel soldier.

292
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,660
不是的
That's not true.

293
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,620
私人手机  没在这里发
Personal phone, off the premises.

294
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,420
可能是有人黑了我的账户什么的
You know, maybe somebody hacked my account or something--

295
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,320
你真要再这么对我撒谎吗
Are you really gonna keep lying to me?

296
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,110
我可以叫人逮捕你
I could have you arrested.

297
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,320
但我宁可你低调离去
But I'd rather you go quietly.

298
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,900
我知道些事  道格
I know things, Doug.

299
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,250
你证明不了什么
Nothing you can prove.

300
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,800
再威胁我啊
Now, threaten me again.

301
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,690
中国如果不加入  提议就没戏
There's no proposal without China's involvement.

302
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,830
凯茜试了
Now, Cathy's tried,

303
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,090
但她跟他们的关系不是特别好
but she doesn't have the best relationship with them.

304
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,930
或许她需要帮助
Maybe she needs some help.

305
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,930
帮助  怎么说
Help? How?

306
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,380
你介意我抽烟吗
Do you mind if I smoke?

307
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,820
当然不
Of course not.

308
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,880
我十年前戒了
I quit about ten years ago.

309
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,970
玛乔莉逼我的
Marjory forced me to.

310
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,110
还是那么好闻
Ah, still smells delicious.

311
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,000
玛乔莉死时什么样
What was it like when Marjory died?

312
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,870
那是...
Oh, well, it was, um...

313
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,080
抱歉  如果你不愿意我们不用谈这个
I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want.

314
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,390
不  没事
No, it's fine.

315
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,330
我们当时已经数月没有真正聊过了
We hadn't had a real conversation in... in months.

316
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,700
她的神智已经不清楚了
Her mind was gone.

317
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,780
她最终死时
When she finally died,

318
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,940
感觉好像被砍掉根肋骨
it felt like a limb had been hacked off.

319
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,430
我...痛不欲生
I felt... devastated.

320
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,470
但也如释重负
But I also felt relieved.

321
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,080
我对我母亲的感觉就是这样
That's what I feel about my mother.

322
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,760
我不...我都没想起来
Oh, I hadn't-- It hadn't even occurred to me.

323
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,720
除了弗兰克  你母亲也病了
You have Frank and your mother.

324
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,070
父亲去世时  我几乎崩溃了
When my father died, it destroyed me,

325
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,490
但想到我母亲时  我毫无感觉
but when I think about Mother, I feel nothing.

326
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,090
-你们不亲近吗  -不
- You two aren't close? - No.

327
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,660
我对弗兰西斯也是这种感觉
And I feel the same about Francis.

328
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,880
毫无感觉
Nothing.

329
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,460
我知道这听起来很可怕
I know that must sound awful.

330
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,760
这很难接受
It's a lot to process.

331
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,050
这没有正误之分
There's no right way or wrong way.

332
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,160
-等下  慢着  -不
- Wait, hold on. - No.

333
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,420
玛乔莉不会同意的
Marjory wouldn't approve.

334
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,970
刚刚说到哪了
We got sidetracked.

335
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,400
对  中国
Yes. China.

336
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,860
我有个主意  如果你相信我能做好的话
I have an idea, if you can trust me to handle it.

337
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,030
我赌上命相信你  克莱尔
I'd trust you with my goddamn life, Claire.

338
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,210
怎么样
Comment c'est elle?

339
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,510
你不会想知道的
You don't want to know.

340
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,200
喝点水吧
Water?

341
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,190
不用  妈妈
Non, ca va, mamon.

342
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,270
我可不希望你们中暑了
Je veux pas vous laisse attraper un coup de chaleur, vous voyez?

343
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,880
我来拿  谢谢
I got it. Ah, merci.

344
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,880
这是谁
C'est qui?

345
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,390
没谁  同事而已
Non, c'est un colleague de moi.

346
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,410
给你  妈妈
Mamon.

347
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,090
莉安
LeAnn.

348
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,910
找你可真难
You are a tough guy to track down.

349
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,080
-你来干什么  -你要赶飞机
- What are you doing here? - You have a plane to catch.

350
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,080
第一夫人需要你的帮助
The First Lady needs your help.

351
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,880
我不想和他们有任何瓜葛
I don't want to have anything to do with them.

352
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,210
无论你对总统的看法如何
Whatever you think of the president,

353
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,120
你对祖国依然负有责任
you still have a duty to your country.

354
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,540
就算他在我离开白宫的那天去世
Even if he dies, the day I walked out the White House,

355
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,550
我也向自己承诺过不会回去
I promised myself I wasn't going back.

356
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,370
你连我们的计划都不知道
You don't even know what we have in mind.

357
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,350
无所谓  我不去
It doesn't matter. I'm not going.

358
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,880
我想请你离开
I'd like you to leave.

359
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,580
这是基本情况的材料
Here's your briefing materials.

360
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,420
你没听见我说吗
You're not hearing me.

361
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,980
你真应该看一眼
You should really take a look.

362
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,070
她的竞选会完蛋的
Her campaign would be over.

363
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,340
而且你父母会怎么想
And what would your parents think?

364
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,250
看上去就像你要利用他受伤...
It looks like you're taking advantage of the fact that he's--

365
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,730
康威仍在进行竞选活动
Conway is still campaigning.

366
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,790
他是共和党人
He's a Republican

367
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,310
而且他的提名已经十拿九稳
and he's already wrapped up his nomination.

368
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,190
和我们不一样
Apples and oranges.

369
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,980
如果我们什么都不做
We are gonna lose,

370
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,020
陪着一个不省人事的人干坐着  会输的
if we sit still, to a guy who's unconscious.

371
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,170
希瑟说得对  安德伍德在大赚同情分
Heather's right. Underwood's scoring major sympathy points.

372
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,940
在接下来的七个州里  他在六个州领先
He's ahead in six of the next seven states.

373
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,260
我们得继续施压
We need to keep the pressure up.

374
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,860
俄罗斯  油价
Russia, gas prices...

375
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,220
攻击一位正与死神搏斗的总统
Attack a president who's fighting for his life?

376
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,330
叫你们来开会不是来辩论的
I didn't call this meeting to debate.

377
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,470
我要夺回那些州
I want those states back.

378
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,240
我们开始准备活动和媒体造势
So let's start organizing events and media hits.

379
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,660
明早之前  确定初步预算和安排
Prelim budgets and schedules, by tomorrow morning.

380
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,690
对于古德温的动机  人们有多种猜测
There has been much speculation as to Goodwin's motivations.

381
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,700
辛西娅
Cynthia.

382
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,290
古德温的事进展如何
Where are we on Goodwin?

383
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,660
已经搞定了保安
The security guy's taken care of.

384
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,850
他没看见你们在一起
He never saw the two of you together.

385
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,640
那其他人呢
What about others?

386
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,640
据他所知  没有
None that he knows of.

387
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,020
但我们又不能四处询问
But it's not like we can ask around.

388
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,690
在2013年11月
In November of 2013,

389
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,740
巴恩斯女士被华府地铁撞击身亡
Ms. Barnes was struck by a D.C. metrorail train.

390
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,650
华府警方将其定性为一场事故
D.C. police classified it as an accident.

391
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,850
有人推测...
Some have speculated that...

392
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,440
坐吧  雷米
Have a seat, Remy.

393
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,550
弗兰克的事我很遗憾
Sorry about Frank.

394
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,340
拜托  省省吧
Oh, please, don't bother.

395
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,000
我已经听够了人们说他们很遗憾
I've had enough people say they're sorry,

396
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,860
我也知道你不是真心的
and I know you don't mean it.

397
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,640
我没法按你希望的那样帮你
I can't help you the way you want me to.

398
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,740
莉安告诉我她已经跟你说得很明白了
LeAnn told me she was very clear with you.

399
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,810
没用的
It won't work.

400
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,090
塔斯克比我更不想帮你
Tusk wants to help you even less than I do.

401
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,110
这不是谁在帮谁  雷米
Well, nobody's doing any favors here, Remy.

402
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,000
他会从中获得一大笔钱
He's going to get very rich from this.

403
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,440
你为什么不亲自跟他说
Why don't you speak to him yourself?

404
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,200
因为他不会听我的
Because he won't listen to me.

405
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,750
这必须听起来像是你的主意  而不是我的
This needs to seem like your idea, not mine.

406
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,870
你也会捞上一大笔的
And you'll make a killing, too.

407
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,370
我不需要钱
I don't need the money.

408
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,830
因为你现在在乎的是别的
Because you care about other things now.

409
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,350
比如杰姬
Like Jackie.

410
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
所以你必须做成此事
Which is why you'll make this happen.

411
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,880
如果我当初跟邓巴说了弗兰克的事
If I had told Dunbar about Frank...

412
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,960
说他知道洗钱的事
about how he knew about the laundering,

413
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,470
他就当不了总统  我们现在也不会站在这儿
he wouldn't be president and we wouldn't be standing here.

414
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,130
但你没有  你现在也说不了了
But you didn't and you can't now,

415
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,430
所以现在是这样
so here we are.

416
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,610
两小时  我们毫无进展
Two hours and we got nowhere.

417
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,280
他只想听中国的反应
All he wants to hear is China.

418
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,180
我告诉他北京方面不回应
I told him Beijing is not responsive.

419
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,380
他根本不在乎
He doesn't give a damn.

420
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,710
第一夫人给他提过醒了
The First Lady put a bug in his ear.

421
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,570
不管她说了什么  他铁了心不听我们的了
Well, whatever bug she put in there won't crawl out.

422
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,520
我会安排次会面  只有你我他三人
I'll set up a meeting. Just you, me and him.

423
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,060
恐怕一次会面是不够的
I don't think a meeting is enough.

424
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,380
我们的副总统
We have a vice president

425
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,840
不知道他在干什么  道格
that does not know what he is doing, Doug.

426
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,660
他必须把外交事务
He needs to completely turn over

427
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,720
全部移交给国务院
all diplomatic affairs to the State Department.

428
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,870
-否则我完全无能为力  -现在不行
- Otherwise, my hands are tied. - Not now.

429
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,910
非常紧急
This can't wait.

430
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,230
我们结束后  我会去找你的
When we're finished, I will come and find you.

431
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,760
您能让我们单独谈谈吗  国务卿女士
Could you give us a few moments, Madam Secretary?

432
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,150
-赛斯  你太过分了  -没关系
- Seth, you're out of line! - It's all right.

433
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,860
给我打电话
Call me.

434
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,860
我会的  谢谢  凯茜
I will. Thank you, Cathy.

435
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,190
谢谢
Thank you.

436
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,640
-你他妈在干什么  -你不能开除我
- What the fuck are you doing? - You can't fire me.

437
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,030
你不能打断我和国务卿的会面
You don't interrupt a meeting with the Secretary of State.

438
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,050
我可以终结邓巴的竞选
I can end Dunbar's campaign.

439
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,400
今天就结束掉
We can end it today.

440
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,110
怎么做
How?

441
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,040
如果我做到  你能让我留下吗
If I deliver, will you keep me on?

442
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,390
你得先告诉我
You tell me how first.

443
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,250
坐吧  玛莎
Have a seat, Martha.

444
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,480
我重新考虑了一下你的辞职
I've had second thoughts about your resignation.

445
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,920
你还想继续当司法部长吗
Would you like to remain as attorney general?

446
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,820
是的  我想
Yes, I would.

447
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,480
谢谢  道格
Thank you, Doug.

448
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,980
希瑟·邓巴有没有告诉过你
Did Heather Dunbar inform you

449
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,790
她和卢卡斯·古德温见过面
of a meeting between herself and Lucas Goodwin?

450
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,740
你要让我的下属审问我吗
You're having me interrogated by my own subordinates?

451
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,970
你能保住工作  他们才是你的属下
They only work for you if you keep your job.

452
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,550
我建议你回答他们的问题
I suggest you answer their questions.

453
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,360
我想要我的律师在场
I'd like a lawyer present.

454
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,900
我提醒你  女士
Let me remind you, ma'am.

455
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,330
没告知我们已经构成了隐瞒证据
Failing to have informed us constitutes withholding of evidence.

456
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,470
希瑟是我的朋友
Heather is a friend.

457
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,930
非常简单  玛莎
It's very simple, Martha.

458
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,370
跟我们合作  你就继续当司法部长
You work with us, you stay on as AG.

459
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,270
不合作  我们就起诉
You don't, we prosecute.

460
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,500
女士们先生们  美国第一夫人
Ladies and Gentlemen, the First Lady of the United States.

461
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,240
大家下午好
Good afternoon, everyone.

462
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,110
我想向大家通报我丈夫康复的最新情况
I'd like to update you on my husband's recovery.

463
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,280
总统的医疗团队
The President's medical team

464
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,640
昨晚做出了全面的评估
gave me a full assessment last night

465
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,480
他们最后的结论是
and they have come to the conclusion

466
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,930
总统需要肝移植
that the President is in need of a liver transplant

467
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,460
才能活下去
if he's to survive.

468
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,180
我请求全国与我共同祈祷
I'm asking the nation to pray with me

469
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,660
弗朗西斯能尽快等到一个健康的肝脏
that a healthy liver makes its way to Francis soon.

470
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,330
抱歉  请等一下
I'm sorry. A moment.

471
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,750
抱歉
I'm sorry.

472
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,770
她很厉害  对吧
She's good, isn't she?

473
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,230
你在这儿干什么
What're you doing here?

474
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,750
至于案件调查...
As for the investigation...

475
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,250
第一夫人需要支持
First Lady wanted some support.

476
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,240
...联调局反恐处处长
...the FBI director of counterterrorism

477
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,150
会向大家进行全面汇报  但是...
will give you a full briefing. But...

478
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,940
我认为有必要亲自澄清
I feel it's important to personally address

479
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,270
在古德温先生住所找到的文件
the document found in Mr. Goodwin's residence

480
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,040
本次发布会前刚刚发到大家手上
that was made available to you just before this conference.

481
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,250
很多措辞足以成为引人注目的头条新闻
It's filled with language that would make for flashy headlines,

482
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,840
比如谋杀  腐败
words like "murder," "corruption."

483
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,540
其中指控总统与彼得·罗素和
The accusation that the President was involved in the deaths

484
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,290
佐伊·巴恩斯的死有关
of Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes.

485
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,730
还有"滥用职权"这样的字眼
Phrases like "abuse of power,"

486
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,190
尽管这一切没有事实依据
while they have no basis in reality,

487
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,350
却让我们悲哀地一窥他饱受困扰的内心
they do give us a sad glimpse into a very troubled mind.

488
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,670
如果有人
And it pains me that anyone,

489
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,210
即使是有精神疾病的人
even someone who is mentally ill,

490
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,180
真会相信古德温先生对我丈夫的指控
would think my husband is capable of

491
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,620
那会让我十分痛心
what Mr.Goodwin believed to be true.

492
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,660
但最让我心痛的是古德温先生的父母
But mostly it pains me for Mr. Goodwin's parents,

493
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,900
他们还在应对失去儿子的痛苦
who are coping with the loss of their son.

494
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,650
据大家说  他一生中大部分时候是个好人
And, by all accounts, he was a decent man for most of his life,

495
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,740
但显然  他内心的什么地方崩溃了
but clearly, something snapped in him

496
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,790
而他迫切需要的时候没能得到帮助
and he never got the help he so desperately needed.

497
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,920
所以我恳请大家尊重他的父母
So I ask that all of you respect his parents' grief

498
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,760
不要对这个生病的年轻人的话加以渲染
by not sensationalizing the words of a sick young man.

499
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,700
让我们记住劳伦斯和贝蒂·密查姆
And let's remember Lawrence and Betty Meechum,

500
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,200
他们的儿子艾德华
whose son Edward

501
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,940
因为古德温先生的病献出了自己的生命
gave his life because of Mr. Goodwin's illness.

502
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,790
艾德华的牺牲是我丈夫还活着的唯一原因
Edward's sacrifice is the only reason my husband is still alive.

503
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,110
我会永远感激
And I'll be forever grateful

504
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,970
他的友谊和奉献
for his friendship and his devoted service.

505
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,330
谢谢
Thank you.

506
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,310
反恐处处长纳森·格林
Counterterrorism Director Nathan Green.

507
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,250
今天调查取得了新进展
Today we had a new development in the investigation.

508
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,420
今天下午我们询问了司法部长
This afternoon, we interviewed the Attorney General.

509
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,160
她告诉了我们她和希瑟·邓巴
She gave us a full account of a conversation she had

510
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,010
在枪击当天进行的谈话的全部内容
with Heather Dunbar the day of the shooting.

511
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,120
谈话中  邓巴女士声称
In this conversation, Ms. Dunbar claimed to have met

512
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,280
曾亲自见过卢卡斯·古德温
with Lucas Goodwin personally.

513
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,220
我们虽没有理由相信
And while we have no reason to believe

514
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,680
邓巴女士和刺杀企图有任何关系
Ms. Dunbar had anything to do with the assassination attempt...

515
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,210
我们会就这场声称的谈话对她进行质询
we will be questioning her about this alleged conversation.

516
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,410
你们要抓她吗
Are you arresting her?

517
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,220
不  女士  我们只是来问几个问题
No, ma'am. We're here to ask a few questions.

518
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,040
-那你需要提出正式请求  -她现在在吗
- Then you need to make a formal request. - Is she here now?

519
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,640
直接把请求发给我
Send the request directly to me,

520
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,830
我会和邓巴女士的律师讨论
and then I'll discuss it with Ms. Dunbar's attorneys.

521
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,950
凯特
Hey, Kate.

522
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,340
我给你打过电话  固话和手机
I tried calling. Home and cell.

523
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,660
座机线拔了  手机关机了
Pulled out the cord. Turned off the cell.

524
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,380
因为我这种人
Because of people like me.

525
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,520
其他人至少有礼貌没跑来我家门口
The others had the courtesy not to show up on my doorstep.

526
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,390
礼貌从没帮我达成什么目的
Courtesy never got me anywhere.

527
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,930
我们能谈谈吗  私下谈
Can we talk? Off the record.

528
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,410
要不是你的话...
If it were anyone but you...

529
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,390
幸运的是  是我
Well, luckily, it isn't.

530
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,810
我去牵福斯托  该遛他了
Let me get Fausto. It's time for his walk.

531
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,420
我是核行业的  不是化石燃料
I'm in the nuclear game, not fossil fuels.

532
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,170
没人有你在中国那样的关系
No one has the relationships you do in China.

533
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,610
中国人已经跟我撇清关系了
Chinese disowned me.

534
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,440
他们会回心转意的
They'll come around.

535
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,040
谁让你来的
Who put you up to this?

536
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,370
我要开自己的公司
Starting my own firm.

537
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,030
我以为你不干了
I thought you were out?

538
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,370
我那是在自欺欺人
I was fooling myself.

539
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,390
总统刚被枪击
So, president gets shot,

540
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,500
你就忍不住要趁火打劫了
and you just can't help taking advantage of the chaos.

541
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,970
你所说的火  我称之为机遇
What you call chaos, I call opportunity.

542
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,150
你是我的第一位客户
And you're my first client.

543
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,270
祝你好运
I wish you the best.

544
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,680
但我不是你的第一位客户
But I'm not your first client.

545
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,850
我不想跟白宫扯上关系
I don't wanna have anything to do with the White House.

546
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,220
你因为沃克的丑闻损失了很多钱
You lost a lot of money during the Walker scandal.

547
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,450
没错  正因此我才要拒绝你
I did, indeed, which is why I'm turning you down.

548
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,300
我很抱歉你跑了这么大老远结果被拒绝
I'm sorry you came all the way out here for a "No."

549
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,820
你不想进监狱吧
You don't wanna go to prison, do you?

550
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,140
再失去仅剩的一切
Lose the rest of it?

551
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,710
我已经被赦免了
I've already been pardoned.

552
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,040
免的是洗钱罪  不是伪证罪
For the money laundering, not for perjury.

553
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,690
你说沃克知道  但是他不知道
You said that Walker knew, and he didn't.

554
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,860
你没有说你当时在跟弗兰克合作
What you didn't say is that you were working with Frank.

555
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,900
人家凭什么相信你而不是我
Why should anybody believe you more than me?

556
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,540
你要么赌一把
You take that chance...

557
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,260
然后看着克雷顿-维斯特变成低价股
and watch Clayton West become a penny stock.

558
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,700
要么我们成为终结石油危机的英雄
Or we're heroes for ending the oil crisis,

559
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,600
大家都发财  你也能重树形象
everybody gets rich, your image is restored.

560
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,210
他们也许还会让你选
They'll probably even let you choose

561
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,350
下一任驻北京的大使
the next ambassador in Beijing.

562
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,610
你并不认为那有一丝真实性
So you don't think any of it is true?

563
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,630
不
No.

564
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,230
我也想相信他
And I wanted to believe him.

565
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,120
那第一夫人泪眼汪汪说的那些话
So the First Lady's whole teary-eyed thing?

566
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,740
我觉得她是对的
I think she's right.

567
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,700
卢卡斯是哪里崩溃了吧
Something in Lucas snapped.

568
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,610
我认识的卢卡斯不会想杀死总统
I mean, the Lucas I knew wouldn't have tried to kill a president.

569
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,140
没错  我就是这意思
Exactly. That's my point.

570
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,230
你真觉得安德伍德杀过人吗
You honestly think Underwood was murdering people?

571
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,720
你的怀疑态度哪去了
Where is your skepticism?

572
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,120
我怀疑卢卡斯  也怀疑白宫
I'm skeptical of Lucas and I'm skeptical of the White House.

573
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,560
那怎么没证据
How come there's no proof?

574
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,140
一点没有
None.

575
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,380
卢卡斯试了  我也试了
After Lucas tried, after I tried.

576
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,670
我的建议是算了吧
My advice is to let it go.

577
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,260
你只会重复我们的徒劳
You're gonna repeat the same goose chase we did.

578
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,380
我总得问一下
I had to ask.

579
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,510
-你的编辑怎么说  -说算了吧
- What does your editor say? - To let it go.

580
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,660
你看吧
You see?

581
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,790
-他可不如你  -那是我以前
- He's not as good as you are. - Was.

582
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,630
真希望你在《电讯报》工作
Wish you were at The Telegraph.

583
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,250
是啊  要是有人被开了就告诉我
Yeah, let me know if anyone gets fired.

584
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,270
门没关
It's open.

585
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,490
我一收到你的短信就尽快赶过来了
I came as soon as I got your text.

586
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,370
发布会后我们忙得不可开交
We've been slammed since the press conference.

587
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,850
情况怎么样
How's it lookin'?

588
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,800
邓巴的事大受关注
Major play on the Dunbar story.

589
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,640
让第一夫人去说是个好主意
It was a good idea to have the First Lady talk.

590
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,820
你要喝苏打水吗
You want a soda?

591
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,380
来杯水什么的吗
A glass of water or anything?

592
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,980
水就好
Water's fine.

593
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,070
我已决定让你留下了
I've decided you can stay.

594
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,540
道格  我希望你能理解
Doug, I hope you can understand.

595
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,130
我紧张了
I got nervous.

596
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,510
当时情况看起来不太好
You know, things weren't looking good and...

597
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,250
我想留条退路  以防万一
yeah, I wanted an out, in case I needed one.

598
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,340
那的确是个错误  我希望我没有那样做
I mean, it was a mistake. I wish I hadn't.

599
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,560
你纠正了你的错误
You corrected your mistakes.

600
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,710
那才是最重要的  要冰块吗
That's all that matters. You want ice?

601
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,790
好的
Sure.

602
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,850
我们现在不能让竞选再出现问题了
We can't afford any more shake-ups in the campaign right now,

603
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,730
尤其总统还在医院里
especially with the president in the hospital.

604
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,780
我们也不能让你再犯错
We also can't afford any more of your mistakes.

605
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,930
闭嘴  闭嘴
Shut up. Shut up!

606
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,220
我刚醒来的时候  说不出话
When I first woke up, I couldn't speak.

607
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,160
我得眨眼来表达我的反应
I had to blink my eyes if I wanted to respond.

608
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,380
你明白吗
Do you understand?

609
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,600
如果我得不到你的忠诚
If I can't get your loyalty,

610
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,240
那我就要你顺从
I will have your obedience.

611
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,600
眨眼
Blink.

612
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,180
眨眼
Blink!

613
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,550
该死
Fuck!

614
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,170
该死的
Fucking...

615
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,730
给
Here.

616
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,290
你有病  伙计
You're fucked up, man.

617
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,430
-别叫了  -早上好  汉默施密特先生
- Quit it. - Good morning, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

618
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,280
有什么事吗
How can I help you?

619
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,740
我们来还你的笔记
Uh, we're just returning your notes.

620
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,190
我们复印过了  这是原件
We made copies. These are the originals.

621
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,580
不是很有用吧
Nothing too useful, huh?

622
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,800
是的  先生  但还是感谢你的配合
No, sir, but thank you for your cooperation.

623
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,980
还有你的报纸  放在台阶上的
Your paper, too. It was on the step.

624
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,680
祝你今天愉快  汉默施密特先生
Well, you have a good day, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

625
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,790
你们也是
You, too.

626
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,080
不要告诉我你又饿了
Don't tell me you're hungry already.

627
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,470
我才喂过你  天呐
I just fed you. Good God.

628
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,170
来了  来了  来了  来了
I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

629
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,580
-早上好  -早上好
- Morning. - Morning.

630
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,470
我建议让凯茜来做谈判
I suggest we turn the negotiations over to Cathy.

631
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,650
如果我们一直拖着俄罗斯  油价会
If we keep stalling on Russia, gas prices will--

632
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,010
现在不是说这个的时候
Now is not a good time.

633
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,140
我不会让总统
I won't have the president

634
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,860
回到一个一片混乱的白宫
come back to a White House in disarray.

635
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,620
我们不知道他会不会回来
We don't know that he is coming back.

636
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,560
他会的  我向你保证
He is. I promise you that.

637
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,370
你是上帝吗  你有什么资格保证
Are you God? Who are you to say?

638
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,240
什么事
Yes?

639
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,460
塔斯克先生和丹顿先生来了
Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton are here.

640
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,580
让他们进来
Send them in.

641
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,110
今早安排的  我们要讨论俄罗斯的事
It was arranged this morning. We're discussing Russia.

642
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,690
先生  我是幕僚长
Sir, I am the Chief of Staff.

643
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,460
这些事情你必须让我知道
You have to keep me informed of these things.

644
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,490
不好意思
Excuse me,

645
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,130
但我觉得应该是你要听我的
but I believe you answer to me,

646
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,380
而不是反过来
not the other way around.

647
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,050
国务卿杜兰特应该参加这个会
Secretary Durant should be here.

648
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,160
这是一次私下碰面
This meeting is private.

649
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,590
我之后会跟你们俩讨论
I'll discuss it with you both after.

650
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,470
总统绝不会允许雷蒙德
The president would never allow Raymond--

651
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,770
-总统先生  -塔斯克先生
- Mr. President. - Mr. Tusk.

652
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,210
雷米  很高兴见到你
Remy, good to see you.

653
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,380
-总统先生  -斯坦普先生
- Mr. President. - Mr. Stamper.

654
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,980
我们稍后继续  道格
I'll follow up with you later, Doug.

655
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,230
是  先生
Yes, sir.

656
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,270
感谢您这么快就抽出时间见我们
Thanks for taking the time to meet with us on such short notice.

657
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,920
石油的问题没时间可以浪费了
Well, there's no time to waste on this oil thing.

658
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,460
我跟中国那边有了些进展
I've made some progress with the Chinese.

659
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,450
先生  第一夫人现在在里面
Sir, the First Lady is in there right now.

660
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,920
她在等我
She's expecting me.

661
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,830
我们还想赢得选举呢
We're trying to win an election,

662
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,850
你却想提醒所有人
and you want to remind everyone

663
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,880
总统赦免了雷蒙德·塔斯克
that the president pardoned Raymond Tusk?

664
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,520
我们换个地方说
Let's find somewhere else.

665
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,130
这都是国家大事
These are matters of state.

666
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,260
你无权干涉
You don't have the authority to intervene.

667
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,160
如果唐纳德想听我的建议  那他就有权这么做
If Donald wants my counsel, that is his prerogative.

668
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,740
你故意骗我
You are deliberately deceiving me.

669
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,750
-你背着我  -你忘了你的身份  道格拉斯
- Going behind my-- - You have forgotten your place, Douglas.

670
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,950
我的身份  那你呢
My place? What about your place?

671
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,190
你在他最需要你时离开  还威胁他
You leave him when he needs you most, you threaten him,

672
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,410
现在他进了医院  你还拆他的台
and now that he's in here, you undermine him.

673
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,420
-你应该  -别说了  够了
- You're supposed to be-- - Stop. That is enough.

674
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,600
我会告诉你一切
I will fill you in on everything,

675
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,640
但不是在这儿  而是在白宫
but not here. At the White House.

676
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,340
怎么了
What's happening?

677
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,760
他的心脏
His heart.

678
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,070
-医生  -他有些偶发心律不齐
- Doctor? - He's had some sporadic arrhythmia.

679
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,300
-请出去一下好吗  -好
- Will you give us the room for a moment? - Of course.

680
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,480
我们不能一直斗下去
We can't keep battling each other,

681
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,090
他都这样子了
not with him like this.

682
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,650
我们需要一条新的道路
We need a new path forward,

683
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,560
我希望你能帮忙
and I would like your help with that.

684
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,620
我保证不会瞒着你
I promise I won't keep you in the dark.

685
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,640
等你准备好  我们白宫见
I'll meet you at the White House whenever you're ready.

686
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,410
我要留在这里  我觉得这更重要
I'm staying here. I think this is more important.

687
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,990
好
Okay.

688
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,030
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood.

689
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,700
关于如何对付俄罗斯
Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton have a proposal

690
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,390
塔斯克先生和丹顿先生有个提议
about how to deal with Russia.

691
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,440
您今天最没想到会见到的就是我吧
I imagine I'm the last person you expected to see today.

692
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,670
见到你们二位
I am a bit surprised,

693
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,760
我的确有些惊讶
yes, to see both of you.

694
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,480
大家对我们的到来肯定都有些警觉
I'm sure there's some wariness about us being here,

695
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,240
但我们有个对付俄罗斯的好计划
but I think we have a good plan on how to handle Russia.

696
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,080
你想加入吗
Would you like to join us?

697
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,010
让雷蒙德给你详说
Raymond can lay it out for you.

698
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,480
我不知道我能提供些什么
Well, I don't know what I can offer.

699
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,600
要是我又开始跟白宫合作的消息传出去
Well, we're going to catch some flack if word gets out

700
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,620
我们肯定要受到抨击的
that I'm back in business with the White House.

701
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,910
你可以帮我们平息那些声音
You could help us smooth that over.

702
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,530
你的新闻发布会相当感人
Your press conference was very moving.

703
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,780
-弗兰克的事  我很遗憾  -谢谢
- I'm sorry about Frank. - Thank you.

704
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,640
当然  他要是知道我进了总统办公室
Of course, he'd have a conniption fit

705
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,170
肯定会大发脾气
if he knew I were in the Oval Office.

706
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,510
他是个实用主义者  雷蒙德  只要成功就行
Well, he is a pragmatist, Raymond. Whatever works.

707
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,260
-我们继续吧  -雷米
- Shall we continue? - Remy.

708
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,730
计划是提出建立
So, the plan is to propose a partnership

709
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,800
美中能源公司合作伙伴关系
between American and Chinese energy companies.

710
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,010
你有点紧张
You seem nervous.

711
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,670
有一阵子没见了
It's been a while.

712
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,390
我该怎么办  老大
What should I do, boss?

713
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,580
萨克逊医生
Dr. Saxon.

714
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,930
我想捐肝
I'd like to donate.

715
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,710
-斯坦普先生  -我是O型血
- Mr. Stamper-- - My blood type is O.

716
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,930
我很健康  我们开始做测试吧
I'm healthy. Let's do the tests.

717
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,690
健康不是捐肝的唯一标准
That's not the only criteria for donation.

718
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,260
你是个正在戒酒的酗酒者  我们不接受
You're a recovering alcoholic. We don't accept--

719
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,990
我不管什么规则
I don't care about the rules.

720
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,460
如果我配型成功  我希望你能做
If I'm a match, I want you to do it.

721
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,340
就算成功了  也帮不上忙
Even if you were, it wouldn't matter.

722
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,370
他已经病得太重  只有部分肝脏不够
He's too ill for a partial liver at this point.

723
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,820
他需要一整个
He needs a full one.

724
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,870
抱歉  但我们只能等待并企盼了
I'm sorry, but we'll just have to wait and hope.

726
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:09,450
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国宪法规定
当总统因故不能履行职责时  应由副总统接替总统职位
但宪法最初并没有对副总统继位的程序作出明确规定
直到肯尼迪总统遇刺后  在冷战的阴影下
美国国会才开始起草
并最终在1967年通过了宪法第25条修正案
对极端情况下总统权力的交接作出了详尽规定

728
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:39,450
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}第25条修正案规定
总统被免职(弹劾)  死亡  或辞职后  由副总统接替总统职位
如果总统因故不能理政
则要向参议院临时议长和众议院议长提交书面声明
副总统便立即就任成为代总统
如果副总统和内阁多数成员
或国会依法设立的其他机构的多数成员
一同向参议院临时议长和众议院议长提交书面声明
称总统无法履行其职责  则副总统可立即就任成为代总统
随后  总统若向参议院临时议长和众议院议长
提交一份书面声明  称自己可以履行职责  便可恢复职权
如遭反对  则需国会进行进一步表决

730
00:45:39,450 --> 00:46:09,450
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}在美国历史上  出现过一次总统因病不能理政
第一夫人垂帘听政的阶段
1919年10月  美国第28任总统威尔逊因中风而卧床不起
在接下来的几个月中  威尔逊的夫人伊迪斯为了不让大权旁落
便将总统与外界隔绝  只允许医生和数名助手探视
所有政务均通过第一夫人传达给总统
许多人认为  在这个阶段  真正打理国事的其实是第一夫人
后来威尔逊的健康虽有所好转
但是直到其第二任期结束  也未完全康复
而伊迪斯对美国政务的影响  也一直持续到他们离开白宫
因此有很多人认为
伊迪斯·威尔逊实际上是美国第一位有实无名的女总统
