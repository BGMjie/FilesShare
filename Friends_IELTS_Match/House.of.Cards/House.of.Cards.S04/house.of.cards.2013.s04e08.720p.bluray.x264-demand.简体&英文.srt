我非常喜欢你的作品  汤姆
I just love your writing, Tom,

28
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,610
从《天蝎》开始
ever since Scorpio.

29
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,870
我觉得你写得越来越好了
I think it just gets better and better.

30
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,280
是吗  你还读过哪本
Oh, yeah? What else have you read?

31
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,270
都读过
All of them.

32
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,400
我觉得你的新书很精彩  《上帝之釜》
I thought the latest was brilliant, God's Cauldron.

33
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,230
-你读过了  -一口气读完的
- You read that? - In one sitting.

34
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,370
但是我们最想读的一本
But what we'd really love to read

35
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,300
是你那本关于安德伍德夫妇的书
is your book on the Underwoods.

36
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,830
那个改了  改成小说了
Well, it's changed. It's fiction now.

37
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,510
但原型是他们
But based on them.

38
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,790
人们可能会去对比
People might draw parallels.

39
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,820
安德伍德夫妇会喜欢吗
Would the Underwoods find it flattering?

40
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,690
我觉得他们不会特别喜欢
I don't think they'd be too happy with it.

41
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,370
你觉得会畅销吗
How do you think it'll do?

42
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,000
-谁知道  -希望比《上帝之釜》要好
- Who knows? - Better than God's Cauldron, I hope.

43
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,030
销量不高  是吗
Sales were disappointing, weren't they?

44
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,790
事实上  你过去十年
In fact, they've been disappointing

45
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,490
写的每一本书销量都不高
on everything you've written the past ten years.

46
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,020
我们可以用这本新书来扭转局面
We can change that with this new book.

47
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,550
我可不是政治工具
I'm not a political tool.

48
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,970
我们接你来  不是因为我妻子是你的粉丝
We didn't fly you up here because my wife's a fan.

49
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,220
你肯定知道我们想要什么
I'm sure you had a notion of what we're after.

50
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,160
我什么想法都没有
I didn't have any expectations.

51
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,630
我来是出于好奇
I just came because I was curious.

52
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,520
那么让我来满足你的好奇心
Well, then let me satisfy your curiosity.

53
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,670
如果你的书能伤到安德伍德夫妇
If your book can hurt the Underwoods,

54
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,340
我们要让它在竞选之前出版
we want it to be published before the election,

55
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,560
并且要让它畅销
and we want it to be big.

56
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,350
戴娜·崔斯特  你认识吧
Dana Treister, do you know her?

57
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,510
《名利场》的编辑
The editor of Vanity Fair.

58
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,450
是的  她是我的密友
That's right. She's a close friend.

59
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,900
还有本·格兰特  波利跳的创始人
And Ben Grant, founder of Pollyhop.

60
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,910
我看到网络直播了
I saw the webcast.

61
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,140
他们没有篡改搜索结果
They don't manipulate search results,

62
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,300
但是  如果在《名利场》上大做广告...
but let's just say a big spread in Vanity Fair...

63
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,960
精彩的选节
Nice juicy excerpt,

64
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,780
托马斯·耶茨的深度报道  他的文学回归
profile on Thomas Yates, his literary comeback.

65
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,500
我们本月上了封面  但下个月就可以是你
We're on the cover this month, but... next month it could be you.

66
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,070
我是最民主党的民主党
I'm on the Marxist side of Democrat.

67
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,230
我为什么要帮助共和党
Why would I help a Republican?

68
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,340
你是帮你自己  汤姆
You'd be helping yourself, Tom.

69
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,390
如果顺便帮助了我们
And if that helps us a little bit along the way,

70
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,020
又有何不可呢
what's the harm in that?

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,950
俄亥俄参议员迪恩·奥斯汀
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio,

72
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,390
领导层竞选搭档的首选
the leadership's top choice for running mate.

73
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,750
供职国会12年
Twelve years in Congress,

74
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,640
能帮我们搞定这个重要摇摆州
helps us with a major swing state,

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,730
立场中立  极少树敌
middle of the road, very few enemies,

76
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,510
他们最看重的  是全国步枪协会的老朋友
and most importantly to them, long-time friend of the NRA.

77
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,670
缺点是  也是个中年白人
Now his shortcomings are he's another middle-aged white guy,

78
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,690
平庸无趣
underwhelming, unimaginative

79
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,760
而且是全国步枪协会的老朋友
and a long-time friend of the NRA.

80
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,100
这就是我对领导层这个选择的态度
So you can see how I feel about the leadership's choice.

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,410
参议员
Senator.

82
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,330
我很荣幸  总统先生
I'm honored, Mr. President.

83
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,100
我只有一个很大的顾虑
I just have one major reservation.

84
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,590
-克莱尔  -是的  先生
- Claire. - Yes, sir.

85
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,840
我只跟你说
Well, between you and me,

86
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,430
我都不确定这项枪支法案能否通过
I'm not even sure this gun bill is gonna pass.

87
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,890
但如果要求我支持它
But if I'm being asked to support it,

88
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,330
我很难做...
you know the sort of hot water--

89
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,120
是的  但我需要你作为竞选搭档
Yes, but I need you on the ticket

90
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,330
来平衡我们对待枪支的立场
to balance our stance on guns.

91
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,820
我们还要争取共和党的支持
We have to appeal to the Republicans as well.

92
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,420
我不要求你支持法案
And look, I'm not asking you to get behind the bill,

93
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,670
只要不公然反对它就好
just not to publicly trash it.

94
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,750
我知道这对您很重要
I know this is an important issue to you.

95
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,120
确实很重要
It is important,

96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,490
但不如一名经验丰富
but not as much as an experienced

97
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,150
能拿下俄亥俄的领导人重要
leader who can deliver Ohio.

98
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,160
那么我同意了  先生
Then consider me on board, sir.

99
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,530
我们不确定能在竞选前进入投票
We're not sure we can get this to the floor before the election.

100
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,270
我们有言在先
That's the deal we made.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,660
奥斯汀的事如你们的愿  法案的事如我们的愿
You get Austen, we get the gun bill.

102
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,880
我们首先需要一份强势的参议院版本
We need a strong Senate version first,

103
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,800
这样才能避免两部无力的法案相互调和
so we don't have two weak bills going into reconciliation.

104
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,950
你们想要奥斯汀  就要让法案通过
You want Austen, you will make this bill a reality.

105
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,400
或者  我们可以重新考虑竞选搭档的人选
Or, we can revisit the choice for running mate.

106
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,950
别  让我们想想办法吧
No... let us see what we can do.

107
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,230
我打给米切尔
I'll call Mitchell.

108
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,330
各位
Gentlemen,

109
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,610
有请未来的副总统
the future vice president.

110
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,370
-恭喜  迪恩  -非常感谢
- Congratulations, Dean. - Thank you very much.

111
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,130
-欢迎  -谢谢  安德伍德夫人
- Welcome. - Thank you. Mrs. Underwood.

112
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,060
-认识你很高兴  -我也是
- Nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you.

113
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,510
你们这边怎么样了
So, how's it going in here?

114
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,730
我们算是达成共识了  是吧
Well, I think we're in alignment. Wouldn't you say?

115
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,510
这次会面很有成效
It's been a productive meeting.

116
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,880
来谈谈什么时候宣布吧
So, let's talk about when we should announce.

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,750
正式宣布之前  我得安抚一下
I, uh, I need to soften the blow to the NRA

118
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,850
全国步枪协会那边
before we go public.

119
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,970
一定要保守秘密
It's imperative we keep a lid on this.

120
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,270
绝不能提前泄露
No leaks until we're ready.

121
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,130
只有我们四个知情
Just the four of us in this room.

122
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,360
当然还有克莱尔
And Claire, of course.

123
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,280
我有个简单采访要做
Well, I need to go do this quick interview.

124
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,490
米切尔那边的进展回头通知我
Um, let me know how it goes with Mitchell.

125
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,360
好了  你肯定有
All right, I'm sure you have some--

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,190
开着吧  屋里太憋了
Oh, leave that open. It gets so stuffy in here.

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,220
来讨论一下时间吧
Let's discuss the timing.

128
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,060
是你还是第一夫人的主意
Was it you or the First Lady?

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,970
-完全是第一夫人  -她觉得可以把我争取过去
- First Lady all the way. - She thinks she can win me over?

130
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,950
她知道你下手肯定最重
She knows you'll hit harder than anyone else.

131
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,930
如果她能坚持到最后  那法案或许就能成
If she's still standing by the end, maybe the bill has sea legs.

132
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,130
-凯特  -早上好  安德伍德夫人
- Kate. - Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

133
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,290
我们去罗斯福室谈吧
How about we talk in the Roosevelt Room?

134
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,340
国会的态度已经摇摆不定了
Support in the House is already wavering.

135
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,410
公众对枪的兴趣也在减退
The public's losing interest in guns.

136
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,640
不等坐下再谈吗
Don't you want to wait until we sit down?

137
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,620
我只有一小时的时间  得充分利用
Your staff only scheduled an hour. I want to make the most of it.

138
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,920
被占了
Oh, it's being used.

139
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,620
换个地方吧
Let's find somewhere else.

140
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,630
凯特
Kate?

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,750
纵观历史  枪支改革的呼声潮起潮落
Well, historically, gun reform comes and goes in waves,

142
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,730
你也知道  我认为这次真的会不一样
as you know, so I believe this time, it can be truly different.

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,730
数据全部在这里进行过滤
All the data's filtered here, within these walls.

144
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,800
分析师先初步过滤  最终
My analysts do a first pass, but ultimately,

145
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,860
由我做最后的筛选
I do the final round myself.

146
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,870
我们最关心的是安全问题
Our biggest concern is security.

147
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,430
顶级防火墙  跟国安局总部的一样
Top-grade firewall, same as you guys use at NSA headquarters.

148
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,350
内部安全呢
What about internal security?

149
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,170
只有我一个有全部权限
I'm the only one with full access.

150
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,740
你要是真发现了什么
So, if you do find anything,

151
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,570
怎么安全地转达给我们呢
how do you communicate that to us in a secure way?

152
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,640
亲自
In person.

153
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,800
我亲自去米德堡  或是你过来
I'll come to Fort Meade myself, or you come here.

154
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,970
设备不带出去
No hardware leaves the premises.

155
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,370
能讲讲你们的过滤算法吗
Can you walk us through how the filtering algorithms work?

156
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,530
拿枪支为例吧
We'll take firearms, for instance.

157
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,030
从每个合法持有枪支的公民开始
If we start with everyone who legally owns a gun,

158
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,950
通过手机追踪用户的地理规律
track geo-location patterns through their phones,

159
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,600
然后描绘一张
we start to put together a portrait

160
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,440
持有者生活  吃饭  购物  等等的地图
of where gun-owners live, eat, shop, everything.

161
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,550
根据这张图  我们预测未登记
From this, we predict everyone who might want a firearm,

162
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,080
但有意购枪的公民
but who isn't registered.

163
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,460
他们的行为模式很可能与合法持有者类似
They're likely to exhibit the same behavior as people who are.

164
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,090
这可以套用于对阿拉伯语感兴趣的人
You can use that for people who are interested in Arabic,

165
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,470
想去中东的人
uh, wanna travel to the Middle East,

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,050
或是对美国政府绝望的人
who are disillusioned with the U.S. Government...

167
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,990
跟我们全球监控
So the same techniques that

168
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,640
用的技术差不多
we're using for our international surveillance.

169
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,850
对
Yes...

170
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,490
但先进得多
but far more advanced.

171
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,590
好了  转过来一点  康威夫人
Okay, turn a little bit towards me, Mrs. Conway.

172
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,480
好
Right.

173
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,690
你真美  汉娜
You look great, Hannah.

174
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,260
-那候选人呢  -别逼我吐槽  威尔
- What about the candidate? - Don't get me started, Will.

175
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,850
-你真上镜  -我知道
- You're really photogenic. - I know.

176
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,690
弗兰妮·华莱士  大四那年
Franny Wallace, senior year.

177
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,730
-完全的金鱼食谱  -这些是特意摆这儿的吗
- The all-Goldfish diet. - Did you have these put here specially?

178
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,850
都是最棒的  亲爱的
We roll out the platinum carpet, darling.

179
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,010
不知道弗兰妮现在在干什么
I wonder what Franny's up to now.

180
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,370
反正不是《名利场》的编辑
Hmm, not the Editor of Vanity Fair, I'll tell you that.

181
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,290
或是即将当上第一夫人
Or about to be the First Lady.

182
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,850
我们真是成绩斐然啊  不是吗
Come a long way, haven't we?

183
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,390
是啊  威尔和我  很感谢你这么做...
Yeah, Will and I, um... Will and I appreciate your doing this.

184
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,670
又不是无偿的
It's not charity.

185
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,870
这一期有你们俩做封面肯定会卖疯了
This issue will sell like crazy with you two on the front.

186
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,130
我还是觉得应该报答你
Well, I feel like I should return the favor.

187
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,040
让我在林肯卧室睡一晚
A night in the Lincoln Bedroom?

188
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,030
一篇报道
A story.

189
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,480
带副本来了吗
You have a copy for me?

190
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,250
这是一份摘要
An excerpt.

191
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,900
-我要整本书  -你只能拿到这个
- I need the whole book. - That's all you get.

192
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,540
康威也拿到了一样的东西
Conway got the same thing.

193
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,430
-这是个错误  汤姆  -他们来找我的
- That was a mistake, Tom. - They came to me.

194
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,600
但他们不能发表...除非我允许
But they don't get to publish... without my approval.

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,210
你想要什么
So what do you want?

196
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,980
-一次会面  -为了什么
- A meeting. - For?

197
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,740
你只是个传话人  道格
You're just a messenger, Doug.

198
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,920
你听到我的话了
You got your message.

199
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,130
给你一周
One week.

200
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,010
谢谢你请的咖啡
Thanks for the coffee.

201
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,410
安德伍德夫人  欢迎
Mrs. Underwood, welcome.

202
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,220
非常感谢您能来录制这段电话自动语音
Thank you so much for recording this robocall.

203
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,250
这对通过这项法案将有莫大的帮助
It'll go a long way in getting this bill passed.

204
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,580
谢谢你出色的工作
Well, thank you for all the extraordinary work you're doing.

205
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,080
我要去哪里呢
Uh, where would you like me?

206
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,230
萨莉会带您去我们安排好进行录音的地方
Uh, Sally will show you where we set up for the recording.

207
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,770
这边请  安德伍德夫人
Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.

208
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,310
莉安
LeAnn...

209
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,910
那是什么
What is that?

210
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,580
姓名  电话号码  邮箱地址
Names, phone numbers, emails.

211
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,690
25万个新目标
A quarter million fresh targets.

212
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,470
25万  你从哪里拿到的
A quarter million? Where'd you get this?

213
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,390
没写回信地址
No return address.

214
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,420
是我们这里掌握的名字的50倍
It's 50 times the names that we have.

215
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,300
是真的吗
Is it legit?

216
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
好像是  我们试着打了几通电话
Looks like it. We made sample calls.

217
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,480
你好  我是克莱尔·安德伍德
Hello, this is Claire Underwood.

218
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,840
我要坦白一件事...
I need to confess something...

219
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,780
一件我并不引以为豪的事
something I'm not proud to confess.

220
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,420
当我在医院里坐在我丈夫身旁时
When I was sitting beside my husband in the hospital...

221
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,370
我只考虑到我自己
all I thought about was me.

222
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,200
我的恐惧  一旦我失去他的痛苦
My fear. My pain if I was to lose him.

223
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,020
这是自私的
And it was selfish.

224
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,510
我没有考虑到其他人
I-- I wasn't thinking about everyone else

225
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,780
那些曾经历同样的恐惧和痛苦的人
who had gone through that fear and pain,

226
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,810
那些曾坐在我所坐的位置上
who had to sit where I was sitting

227
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,890
他们所爱的人被不该持有枪支的人射伤的人
because a loved one was shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun.

228
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,160
我感到羞愧  因为我从未对此做过什么
I'm ashamed because I've never done anything about it.

229
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,510
我为本可拯救的那么多生命而羞愧
I'm ashamed of how many lives we could've saved.

230
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,460
那么多家庭本可避免这样的痛苦
How many families we could've kept from suffering.

231
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,430
我们都应该感到羞愧  我们每一个人
We should all be ashamed, every one of us,

232
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,410
因为我们所有人都有责任
because the blood is on all of our hands,

233
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,900
而什么都不做就等同于扣动扳机
and doing nothing is the same as pulling a trigger.

234
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,340
我们得做点什么
We need to do something.

235
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,630
那就是  修改法律
And that means changing the law.

236
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,840
奥斯汀参议员办公室
Senator Austen's office.

237
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,150
从下午开始已经接到五百多个电话了
More than 500 since this afternoon.

238
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,310
单单我们区吗
From our district?

239
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,930
我们都算少的
We have it light.

240
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,780
我听说其他办公室接到一千多个电话
I'm hearing that other offices have gotten over a thousand.

241
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,970
奥斯汀参议员办公室  我会转达
Senator Austen's office. I will take a message.

242
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,430
弗兰西斯
Francis.

243
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,570
你真的不该这么做
You really shouldn't.

244
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,580
抽一根不会死的
Oh, one won't kill me.

245
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,550
你读完了吗
Did you finish it?

246
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:11,930
嗯
Yeah.

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,700
有一个地方吸引了我
One part really caught my eye.

248
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,350
"一条裂缝在他们之间蔓延开来
"A chasm opened up between them,

249
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,070
那是一条不到九米宽的走廊
a hallway less than ten yards wide.

250
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,080
但它就像有两千公里那么长
But it might as well have been a thousand miles.

251
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,420
这是一片布置精致的无人之地
A well-appointed no man's land

252
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,510
丝绒地毯和高悬的天花板隔开了两间卧房
with a plush carpet and high ceiling between two bedrooms.

253
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,980
卧房里住着两个世纪的鬼魂
In it were two centuries of ghosts,

254
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,910
之前所有的总统和第一夫人
all the Presidents and First Ladies before them.

255
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,960
还有他们婚姻的鬼魂
But also the ghost... of their marriage.

256
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,280
30年的斗争  让他们的心都死了
A thirty years' war that left them both dead inside

257
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,320
两人之间也是一片荒原"
and this dead space between them."

258
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,610
真有洞察力
He's perceptive.

259
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,960
简直可怕
Uncanny.

260
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,520
那已经不是我们了  已经变了
Well, it's not who we are. Not anymore.

261
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,740
就算是假的  人民还是愿意相信是真的
People will want to believe it's true even if it's false.

262
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,740
你觉得他想得到什么
What do you think it is he wants to accomplish?

263
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,410
我叫你辞职之后  有一晚他来过
He came here one night, after I'd asked you to resign.

264
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,470
他说他很着迷
He said he was obsessed.

265
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,870
也许他还想接着写
Or maybe he wants back in.

266
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,830
你对他有感情
You felt something for him.

267
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,130
有那么一刻吧
Maybe for a moment.

268
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,870
-你呢  -没有
- Did you? - No, I don't think so.

269
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,010
我感觉
I felt...

270
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,570
我感觉他看得到我
I felt like he saw me.

271
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
我也是
Me, too.

272
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,940
巴恩斯先生
Mr. Barnes.

273
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,230
你打过电话之后  我就一直在想
I couldn't stop thinking, since you called...

274
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,680
佐伊的事
about Zoe.

275
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,220
-我想要个答案  -我也是
- I guess I want answers. - That-- That's what I want, too.

276
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,210
-你想知道什么  -他们有过恋情吗
- What is it you want to know? - Was there... a relationship?

277
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,480
她和安德伍德
With Underwood?

278
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,730
她17岁时  去上学之前
When she was 17, just before she went off to school...

279
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,920
她发现我有外遇
she found out I was having an affair.

280
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,040
药物公司的销售代表
Sales rep, some drug company.

281
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,020
是个金发妞
Blonde. You know.

282
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,640
这是非正式的谈话吧
This isn't, you know, on the record.

283
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,970
当然  你不想公开就不公开
No... No, not if you don't want it to be.

284
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,530
你说她发现了
You said she found out.

285
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,460
她给我三天时间向她妈妈坦白  不然就
She gave me three days to tell her mother, or she would...

286
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,990
抱歉  喝了点酒
I'm sorry, I had a few drinks.

287
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,140
-你告诉她了吗  -告诉了
- Did you tell her? - Yeah, I told her.

288
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,410
我们离婚了
We split up.

289
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,540
那之后佐伊就不怎么理我了
Zoe didn't talk to me much after that.

290
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,340
我不清楚安德伍德的事
I don't know anything about Underwood.

291
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,210
她肯定不会告诉我
I'm the last person she would've told.

292
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,420
我真希望我当初  能多尽点力
I wish I would've... made more of an effort...

293
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,560
跟她沟通
to reach out to her.

294
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,130
你在开车吗  巴恩斯先生
Are you driving, Mr. Barnes?

295
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,310
对
Yeah.

296
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,890
-我快到家了  -你该停车
- I'm almost home. - You should pull over.

297
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,000
你查到什么了吗
Did you find out anything?

298
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,600
可以告诉我的事
Anything you can tell me?

299
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,130
她在《先驱报》没几个朋友
She didn't have a lot of friends at the Herald.

300
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,610
就我的了解
Um, from what I can gather,

301
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,620
她就没有亲密的朋友
she didn't have any close friends at all.

302
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,150
我跟她邻里的人谈过
I spoke to some people in her neighborhood...

303
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,640
但还没什么发现
but nothing so far.

304
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,220
你会告诉我吗
Will you?

305
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,760
-如果查到  -当然
- If you... - Yeah, of course, of course.

306
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,380
如果你想起了什么
If you think of anything...

307
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,240
当然
Yeah.

308
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,920
那你当时去那儿干什么
Then what were you doing there?

309
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,720
我去白宫开会
If I do a meeting at the White House,

310
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,830
还需要理由吗  茱莉亚
I don't have to explain myself, Julia.

311
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,400
法案可能会通过
This bill might pass.

312
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,490
-我知道  -你在帮他们吗
- I realize that. - Are you helping them?

313
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,730
当然没有
Absolutely not.

314
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,770
-茱莉亚  -安德伍德夫人
- Julia. - Mrs. Underwood.

315
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,530
抱歉  我该跟你握手  但我刚跑步回来
Sorry, I'd shake your hand, but I just got back from a run.

316
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,480
我想说
Listen, I wanted to say,

317
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,540
我知道上次的会面不太顺利
I know our meeting last time didn't go very well,

318
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,440
那是怪我  我的话太无礼了
and that's on me. It was rude, what I said,

319
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,640
希望你接受我的道歉
and I hope you'll accept my apology.

320
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,680
请坐吧
Have a seat, please.

321
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,200
你以前进过宅邸吗
You ever been in the residence before?

322
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,800
套近乎我也不会支持你的
The personal touch isn't going to bring me on board.

323
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,100
给国会打几千个电话也没用
Neither will a few thousand calls to Congress.

324
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,150
不到24小时  8.4万个
84,000 in less than 24 hours.

325
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,280
先不谈那个
But let's put that aside for a moment

326
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,580
-来说说你的好朋友  -谁
- and talk about your good friend. - Who?

327
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,240
-奥斯汀参议员  -他说了  竞选搭档
- Senator Austen. - He told me. Running mate.

328
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,080
不只是竞选搭档
Oh, not just running mate.

329
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,190
你说我不必支持这个法案的
You said I wouldn't have to support this bill.

330
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,280
是啊  但是计划赶不上变化  迪恩
Yes, but a lot can change in a day, Dean.

331
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,480
我们没想到会有这么大的呼声
We had no idea there'd be this sort of groundswell.

332
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,570
就因为跟你共处一室
Julia Melman was all over

333
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,360
茱莉亚·梅尔曼就对我逼问个不停
my ass even for being in the same room as you.

334
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,730
你告诉她了吗
Did you tell her?

335
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,470
-没办法  -天哪  迪恩
- I had to. - Christ, Dean...

336
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,030
不然就要树个死敌
It was that, or make an enemy for life.

337
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,770
她很生气  但应该能想明白
She's upset, but I think she'll come around,

338
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,880
除非你逼我支持
unless you make me endorse

339
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,790
堵上枪展和网络卖枪的漏洞
closing the gun show and Internet loopholes.

340
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,370
那她可就要爆发了
Then she'll go ballistic.

341
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,320
迪恩不会的  我们为他的竞选出资上百万
Dean wouldn't do that. We've poured millions into his campaigns.

342
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,110
现在他不需要你了
And now he doesn't need you anymore.

343
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,140
你是要威胁我吗  逼我们让步
Are you trying to intimidate me? To get us to back down?

344
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,890
不  我有个提议
No, I have an offer.

345
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,170
民主党想拿下俄亥俄不容易
Ohio's a tough state for Democrats.

346
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,600
茱莉亚一直对我很好
Julia's been very good to me.

347
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,040
我懂  忠诚是很重要
Loyalty's important, I understand,

348
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,880
但你现在必须忠于我
but your loyalty has to be with me now.

349
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,230
我做不到
I just can't do it.

350
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,400
好吧  那就不公布了
All right, then we'll cancel the announcement.

351
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,770
我另找个竞选搭档好了
I'll find someone else to be my running mate.

352
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,950
不  我没法支持这项法案
No, I mean, I... I just can't support this bill.

353
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,070
但是现在  两件事绑在一起了
Oh, but you see, the two go hand in hand now.

354
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,830
你答应不答应
So, are you on the ticket or not?

355
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,070
如果众议院通过  参议院不通过呢
What if the gun bill passes in the House, but not the Senate?

356
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,830
你要什么回报
In return for what?

357
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,330
你说服参议员退出
You convince the senator to pull out.

358
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,240
领导层想要他  我们也配合了他们
Now, the leadership wants him, and we've played nice,

359
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,800
但我和总统想要的是凯茜·杜兰特
but the president and I want Cathy Durant.

360
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,630
她参选要更有希望
She's a much stronger candidate.

361
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,840
你愿放弃自己的法案吗
You're willing to abandon your own bill?

362
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,370
要在击败康威和击败你之间选
If it's means beating Conway or beating you,

363
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,010
多容易选啊
that's not a hard choice.

364
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,310
我已经告诉迪恩
I already told Dean that

365
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,120
他做竞选搭档我可以接受
I could live with him being running mate.

366
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,530
我怎么能反悔
How do I backtrack?

367
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,830
明天看新闻吧
Just watch the news tomorrow.

368
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,400
你做了正确的选择
You made the right choice.

369
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,290
-但愿吧  -别但愿  就是
- I hope so. - Well, don't hope so, know so.

370
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,220
我会让赛斯给你发份讲稿
And I'll have Seth send you a copy of the speech.

371
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,160
可以送参议员出去了  谢谢
You can show the senator out now, thank you.

372
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,120
是  先生
Yes, sir.

373
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,790
-抱歉  -没关系  进来吧
- Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay. Come in.

374
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,110
-他怎么说  -愿意配合  她呢
- What did he say? - He'll do it. What did she say?

375
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,090
会考虑一下
That she'll think about it.

376
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,850
怎么知道她不会把计划说出去
How do we know she won't tell him our plans?

377
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,880
我说如果她说出去
I told her if she does,

378
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,160
我们就尽力让参议院通过法案
we'll make sure the bill goes through the Senate.

379
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,850
给我递条毛巾好吗
Can you hand me a towel, please?

380
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,160
-密查姆的手  -什么
- Meechum's hand. - What?

381
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,900
我前一阵在楼下一面墙上画了个轮廓
I traced it on a wall downstairs... A while back.

382
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,630
被粉刷盖上了  算了
They've painted over it. Oh, never mind.

383
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,730
弗兰西斯  我在想耶茨
Francis, I've been thinking about Yates.

384
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,570
康威夫妇什么都有
The Conways have everything.

385
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,160
有孩子  视频  推特
They have their children, their videos, their Twitter.

386
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,590
没几个人理解我们
There are very few people who understand us.

387
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,800
密查姆就是一个
Meechum... was one.

388
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,090
汤姆也是
Tom is another.

389
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,650
八

好鞋子先生  滚吧  滚吧
Mr. Nice Shoes. Go! Go, go, go.

393
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,420
-滚  -你饿吗
- Go! - Are you hungry?

394
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,190
不要钱  你走  带着你的钱走
No money. You need to go. You and your money, go.

395
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,320
-我要叫警察了  -好了  好了

397
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,850
-我要叫警察  -好了  好了
- I'm calling the cops. - All right, all right.

398
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,810
女士
Ma'am...

399
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,560
我是汤姆警员
I'm Officer Tom.

400
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,840
是您打的电话吗
You called for me?

401
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,780
刚刚有个人

404
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,740

在这儿见过这个坏人吗
Did you ever see this bad man on your block?

406
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,100
在这儿见过这个坏人吗
Did you ever see this bad man on your block?

407
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,900
好吧
All right.

408
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,230
那这个女人呢  见过她吗
What about this woman? Did you ever see her?

409
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,180
-真美  -是的  是很美
- Pretty. - Yes, yes, she is.

410
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,980
婊子
Whore!

411
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,340
-滚开  -为什么那么说
- Go away! - Why'd you say that?

412
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,550
-滚开  滚开  -为什么那么说  告诉我
- Go away. Go away. - Why'd you say that? Tell me.

413
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,560
告诉汤姆警员  为什么那么说她
Tell Officer Tom. Why did you call her that word?

414
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,460
滚开
Go away!

415
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,690
我和儿子亲手建的
Built this myself, with my son.

416
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,540
他明年春天要爬船长峰
He's doing El Capitan next spring.

417
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,240
徒手攀登
Free-climb.

418
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,730
我觉得竞选总统
I feel like running for president

419
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,840
就像不系安全绳爬悬崖
is like climbing a cliff without a safety rope.

420
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,040
对了  媒体怎么不知道你在这儿
How is it the press don't know you're here, by the way?

421
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,880
像你一样  将军
Just like you, General,

422
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,150
我周末也会休假  陪陪家人朋友
I take Sundays off to spend time with family and friends.

423
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,290
或是交新朋友
Or to make new friends.

424
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,930
州长  我知道你还是希望我辞职
Look, Governor, I know you still want me to resign.

425
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,390
但我之前不该拿那个做威胁
But I was wrong to threaten that.

426
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,710
德雷尔告诉我哈里发国这周又占领了一块油田
Dreyer told me ICO took over another oil field this week.

427
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
他们的势力在壮大
They're growing.

428
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,340
德雷尔什么都跟你说啊
Dreyer shares a lot with you, doesn't he?

429
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,790
这就发生在你眼皮底下  将军
This is happening on your watch, General.

430
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,220
总统不作为  你也不能逼他
The president isn't acting and you can't force him to.

431
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,500
只要你留下就不能
Not if you stay.

432
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,910
不过你要是辞职  我保证你还会有工作的
If you resign, though, I promise it'll only be temporary.

433
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,920
我一扯上政治  就回不了头了
Once I get political, I can't cross back over the line.

434
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,680
我不是要等上任后重新委任你
I don't mean a recommission.

435
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,300
我要让你做我的竞选搭档
I mean making you my running mate.

436
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,780
谢谢
Thank you.

437
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,760
-读了吗  -只读了摘要  很有力
- Have you read it? - Just an excerpt. It's powerful.

438
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,050
会很有争议  答应我我就给你看
And it'll be controversial. Say yes and I'll show you.

439
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,550
《电讯报》不会允许的
The Telegraph would never let me.

440
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,800
-母公司都是我们家  -那也不行
- Same parent company, both our titles. - Doesn't matter.

441
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,600
报社对打兼职有很明确的态度
Paper is strict when it comes to moonlighting.

442
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,160
没关系  因为我爸爸是董事
It does matter, because my dad is on the board.

443
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,810
给你的编辑打个电话
One call to your editor...

444
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,210
会有很多人抢着要这个机会
There... there are plenty of people who would jump at doing this.

445
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,130
但没有对他那么"了解"的人
Not who know him intimately.

446
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,310
我的新竞选记者
My new election correspondent,

447
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,130
看到你和耶茨在竞选途中溜出去了
he saw you and Yates sneaking off on the campaign trail.

448
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,140
耶茨会对你坦言的
Yates will open up to you.

449
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,940
你肯定知道该怎么出招
I'm sure you know what buttons to push.

450
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,910
有利益冲突
It's a conflict of interest.

451
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,360
我爸爸给我看了你写的文章
My dad showed me that article you wrote.

452
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,440
你叫他暴君  没发表出来的那篇
The one that never went to print where you called him a tyrant.

453
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,530
有些人的职业是靠声誉打下来的
Some of us have built our careers on our reputations,

454
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,360
而不是靠摆弄爸爸给的杂志
not by having their daddies give them a magazine to play with.

455
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,780
或是跟老同学套近乎
Or by cozying up to old school chums, right?

456
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,770
这些话我都听过
I've heard it all before.

457
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,230
你可能不喜欢我  不喜欢康威夫妇
You may not like me, you may not like the Conways,

458
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,250
但我觉得比起让安德伍德再干四年
but I have to believe you can stomach us better

459
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,170
你会更愿意接受我们
than another four years of President Underwood.

460
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,730
-写得不错  -我知道
- Well, the writing is good. - I know.

461
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,580
但还不足以胁迫总统
Not good enough to strong-arm a president.

462
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,810
倒是能让我进到这屋里来
Well, good enough to get me in this room.

463
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,460
我以为弗兰西斯跟你说清楚了
I thought Francis made it very clear to you,

464
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,410
你不能挑衅我们
you were not to challenge us.

465
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,670
是啊  他说他会告诉全世界
Yeah. He said he would tell the world

466
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,160
《天蝎》不是我写的
I didn't write Scorpio.

467
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,500
我希望你明白
I hope you understand

468
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,060
我们不能允许你在选举前出版这本书
that we can't allow you to print this before the election.

469
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,430
我明白
I do.

470
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,320
那你为什么想见我
Then why did you want to meet?

471
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,880
我需要个结尾
I need an ending.

472
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,220
我有个还凑合的结尾  但我不喜欢
I have one I can live with, but not the one I love.

473
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,830
-因为是假的  -你的确走了
- Because it's false. - Well, it's true that you left.

474
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,470
我要是走了  就不会在这儿了
If I left, I wouldn't be here.

475
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,280
我根本不相信
I don't believe for a second

476
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,000
你去拜访你母亲是因为她病了
you went to visit your mother because she was sick.

477
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,010
为什么
And why is that?

478
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,420
因为你一次都没跟我提过她
Because you never mentioned her one time to me.

479
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,520
有时候只字不提能代表千言万语
Saying nothing says a lot sometimes.

480
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,990
要是故事重点不是她如何离开
Well, what if the story isn't about how she left,

481
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,520
而是她如何回来呢
but how she came back.

482
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,220
你在这里  不代表你全身心都在
Just because you're here doesn't mean you're here.

483
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,570
你肯定想知道吧
Well, wouldn't you like to know?

484
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,450
你不是想要结尾吗
Don't you want your ending?

485
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,050
你要跟我说吗
Are you gonna tell me about it?

486
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,190
关于你们俩  不许说谎
About the two of you? No lies.

487
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,720
不  我什么也不说
No, I'm not going to tell you anything.

488
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,990
你可以像以前一样观察
You can observe, like you did before.

489
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,450
不过这次  你所见到的一切都属于你
The difference is everything you see this time will be yours.

490
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,340
我们想得到点东西作为回报
And in return, we would like something.

491
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,960
讲稿  我们需要了解我们
Speeches. We need someone who knows us...

492
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,200
也了解我们态度的人
and knows our voices.

493
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,850
讲稿撰稿人  你开玩笑吧
A speechwriter? You're kidding.

494
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,780
只有这个办法能解释你为什么和我们在一起
It's the only way to justify you being with us...

495
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,610
以防媒体问起
in case the press ask.

496
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,550
你们是想盯着我
You want to keep an eye on me.

497
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,110
我觉得挺公平的  不是吗
Well, I think that's fair. Don't you?

498
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,050
如果你要盯着我们的话
If you're keeping an eye on us?

499
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,730
你给我们一周  我们就给你一天
So you gave us a week. We'll give you a day.

500
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,130
就是在这里  在这个地方
It was right here, on this very spot,

501
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,910
我被一支非法获得的手枪
that I was shot with two bullets

502
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,560
所射出的两颗子弹击中
from an illegally obtained handgun.

503
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,800
特勤局特工艾德华·密查姆
Secret Service Agent Edward Meechum,

504
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,110
前海军陆战队队员  也是我的朋友
a marine and my friend,

505
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,110
因同一支手枪射出的子弹而牺牲
was slain with the bullets from that very same gun.

506
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,540
最近几天
The public support...

507
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,140
公众对第一夫人的《背景普查法案》的
for the First Lady's... Universal Background Check Bill

508
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,880
支持呼声震耳欲聋
has been deafening in these last few days.

509
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,030
我们听到了成千上万人的呼声
We have heard from thousands and thousands of voices,

510
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,870
今天  我们想向其中再增加一个声音
and today, we would like to add one more voice to that chorus.

511
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,920
这声音强而有力
And it is a powerful voice.

512
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,590
俄亥俄州迪恩·奥斯汀参议员
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio.

513
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,180
谢谢您  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,120
我十多岁起就是全国步枪协会的成员
I've been a member of the NRA since I was a teenager.

515
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,370
我一直都是持枪权利的强烈支持者
I've always been a fierce advocate for gun rights.

516
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,310
但今天我要强力支持
But today I want to offer my strong support

517
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,240
第一夫人的法案
for the First Lady's bill.

518
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,940
给你
Here you go.

519
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,900
-我再问你一个问题  -我告诉你  伙计
- Let me ask you another question. - I'm tellin' you, man,

520
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,610
你要是说她住在这个街区  我相信你
if you say she lived on the block, I believe you.

521
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,840
但她肯定不喜欢披萨
But she must not have liked pizza,

522
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,580
因为我不记得见过她的脸
'cause I don't remember ever seein' her face.

523
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,920
不是她  安德伍德总统
Not her. President Underwood.

524
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,050
天啊  这人真是阴魂不散
Oh, Christ, I can't get away from this guy.

525
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,430
他妻子刚刚给我打了电话  关于枪的自动电话
His wife just called me. Robocall about guns.

526
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,510
你在这附近见过他吗
You ever seen him around this neighborhood?

527
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,270
见过  经常见到
Oh, yeah. All the time.

528
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,860
周五晚打过保龄球后和英国女王一起
With the Queen of England, Friday nights, after bowling.

529
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,460
在他还在国会的时候
When he was in Congress.

530
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,280
一次都没见过
Nah, never once.

531
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,680
否则我会记得的  我擅长记面孔
I would've remembered. I'm good with faces.

532
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,510
-帕尔玛干酪  -在那边
- Parmesan? - Over there.

533
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,440
但这个人我见过几次
I saw this guy a few times, though.

534
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,800
-参议员  -不  那个死掉的人
- The senator? - No, the, uh, the dead guy.

535
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,160
那个特勤局的
The Secret Service guy.

536
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,560
在这儿吗
In here?

537
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,090
是啊  他之前经常来喝咖啡
Yeah, a while back. He used to stop in for coffee.

538
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,070
不吃披萨  只喝咖啡
Never any pizza, just coffee.

539
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,380
-你确定吗  -我说过  我擅长记面孔
- You're positive? - Yeah. I told you, I'm good with faces.

540
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,120
"起落架收起了  几秒钟之后
"The wheels lifted, and within seconds,

541
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,680
华盛顿就消失在
Washington fell away, disappearing

542
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,450
一团烟雾中了
under a blanket of haze and smog.

543
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,640
她前额顶着窗户
Forehead pressed to the window,

544
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,770
想象一千年前
she imagined this was exactly

545
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,700
这里肯定也是这番景象
how it must have looked a thousand years ago,

546
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,800
太阳升过云端
when the sun rose above the clouds

547
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,810
而下面只有一片沼泽
and there was nothing but a swamp beneath.

548
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,430
在这个高度  看到这番景象
From this height, with this view,

549
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,190
她可能是在任何地方
she could be anywhere.

550
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,290
但关键是  她不在那里"
But the important thing is she was anywhere but there."

551
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,600
-还要一杯吗  -要
- You want another? - Yeah.

552
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,720
他说为什么了吗
Did he say why?

553
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,580
谢了  戴娜
Okay, thanks, Dana.

554
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,910
耶茨退出了
Yates pulled out.

555
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,120
说他跟安德伍德夫妇达成了协议
Said he came to an agreement with the Underwoods.

556
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,220
他拿我们相互做筹码
He was playing us off each other.

557
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,870
我们还是可以放出摘要
We could still leak the excerpt.

558
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,810
太冒险  不被人查到还好
It's too risky. If we get away with it, great.

559
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,880
要是被查到
If we don't,

560
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,870
我们就成了坑害知名小说家的投机分子
we look like opportunists fucking over an acclaimed novelist.

561
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,980
不值得
It's not worth it.

562
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,590
你觉得他们之间真的有裂痕吗
Do you think it's true, that chasm between them?

563
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,410
谁知道
Who knows?

564
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,470
我喜欢他的文笔
I love that writing.

565
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,100
-真希望能看到剩下的  -我讨厌《天蝎》
- I wish I could've read the rest of it. - I hated Scorpio.

566
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,410
-写得多美  -就是垃圾
- It was beautiful. - It's garbage.

567
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,570
-为什么  -主角是个怂货
- Why? - The main character's a pussy.

568
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,720
-威尔  你知道我讨厌那个词  -他就是
- Will, you know I hate that word. - He is.

569
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,160
他最好的朋友自杀  他却袖手旁观吗
He lets his best friend kill himself. He does nothing?

570
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,140
他很痛苦  反正也要死了
He was in pain. He was going to die anyway.

571
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,080
那也不重要  还是懦弱
It doesn't matter. It's cowardly.

572
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,460
我觉得他很勇敢  他朋友也是
I think he was brave. And his friend.

573
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,560
我觉得耶茨能写出来也很勇敢
And I think Yates was brave to write it.

574
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,510
勇敢是不放弃  无论如何战斗到底
Brave is never giving up. You fight, no matter what.

575
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,420
如果耶茨同意了  凯特·鲍德温本来也会同意
So, Kate Baldwin was willing if Yates was in?

576
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,990
是啊  戴娜让她写两万词
Yeah, Dana was giving her 20,000 words.

577
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,540
应该可以再斡旋一下
I think we can pivot.

578
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,780
怎么做
How?

579
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,910
再给她打个电话
Get her back on the phone.

580
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,750
-茱莉亚  -奥利维亚  都不知道你来了
- Julia. - Olivia, I didn't know you were in town.

581
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,110
就是来看看
Oh, just a little visit.

582
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,930
我有时候还挺想迪恩的  别告诉他
I miss seeing Dean's face sometimes. Don't tell him that.

583
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,080
-能让我们单独谈吗  -她不用走
- Will you give us a few minutes? - No, she should stay.

584
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,520
我知道你们有事要谈
Oh, I know you have things to discuss.

585
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,710
比如你丈夫放弃做竞选搭档
Like your husband withdrawing from the ticket.

586
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,690
她是为此而来吧  跟你一起宣布
That's why she's in town, right? For the announcement.

587
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,810
我知道那个新闻发布会肯定让你很意外
I know the press conference must've caught you off guard,

588
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,840
但总统不想让你知道
but the president didn't want you to know.

589
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,570
-他觉得你会组织抗议  -他说对了
- He thought you'd organize a protest. - He was right. I would've.

590
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,460
我希望能坐下  宣布之前好好谈谈
My plan was to sit down, talk this out before the announcement.

591
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,410
没什么好宣布的了
There isn't gonna be an announcement.

592
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,150
你不能大摇大摆走进来
You... you can't waltz in here--

593
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,360
你丈夫初出茅庐时
We've raised $20 million

594
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,350
我们就给他捐了两千万
for your husband since he was a freshman.

595
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,920
我就可以随时大摇大摆走进来
That gives me the right to waltz in whenever I want.

596
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,730
-放尊重点  -亲爱的  行了
- Show some respect. - Honey, please.

597
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,680
不  这是我们要的
No. This is what we wanted.

598
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,600
-我们奋斗的目标  -等安德伍德输了
- What we've worked for. - When Underwood loses,

599
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,720
你接下来两年可就有仗要打了
you'll spend the next two years fighting off a primary opponent.

600
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,470
我们在俄亥俄的二十万会员都会反对你
Every one of our 200,000 members in Ohio will turn on you.

601
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,260
等你没了这个职位
By the time you've lost this office,

602
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,370
奥利维亚的律所也会黄了
Olivia's law firm will go tits up.

603
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,980
别忘了  我们给你引了好多客户
Don't forget, we pushed most of your clients your way.

604
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,670
他临阵退缩了  我能怎么办
He got cold feet. What can I do?

605
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,050
劝他改主意
Convince him to change his mind.

606
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,250
他不听  他说全国步枪协会对他严词威胁
He wouldn't listen. He says the NRA came down hard on him.

607
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,590
因为你让他做了新闻发布会
Because you had him do the press conference.

608
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,550
不  那是奥斯汀的主意  不是我的
No, that was Austen's idea, not mine.

609
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,260
我跟他说了要低调
I told him to lay low,

610
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,460
但他说如果他要加入  就要完全投入
but he said if he was in, he wanted to be all in.

611
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,640
我们的打算是平衡你们两人的立场
The idea was to balance the ticket.

612
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,650
奥斯汀这条路已经不通了
Well, we can't do anything about Austen.

613
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,640
问题是我们能找谁来代替他
The question now is who do we get to replace him?

614
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,800
再看看名单
Go back to the list?

615
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,130
他还好  但那张名单上别人我都没兴趣
He was fine, but I'm not enthused by anyone else on that list.

616
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,810
别又回到起点了  总统先生
Let's not go back to square one, Mr. President.

617
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,110
我们有张不错的名单
We have a good list.

618
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,730
大家都会支持那些人的
Everybody can get behind those names.

619
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,530
这是常理
It's common sense.

620
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,030
常理唯一的问题就是  太普通了
The only problem with common sense is that it's so... common.

621
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,920
我觉得我们有更好的选择
I think we can do better.

622
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,200
谁
Who?

623
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,700
凯茜·杜兰特
Cathy Durant.

624
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,850
路易斯安那不是摇摆州  这我清楚
Now, Louisiana's not a swing state, I know that.

625
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,050
但她仍然是个全国知名人物
But she is still a national figure,

626
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,950
她能帮助我们争取女性选民的选票
she helps us with the women's vote,

627
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,770
并且我信任她
and I trust her.

628
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,370
枪支呢
What about guns?

629
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,050
她似乎对此立场并不坚决
I don't think she's ever had a strong position.

630
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,500
比那更好  她对这个问题从未发表过意见
It's better than that. She's never uttered a word on the issue.

631
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,680
我们查过了
We checked.

632
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,760
-我喜欢  -我也是
- I like it. - So do I.

633
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,240
-但我还有个想法  -谁
- But I had another thought. - Who?

634
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,770
不是"谁"  是怎样
Not "Who." How.

635
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,040
我觉得不应该由我选她
I don't think I should choose her.

636
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,130
我认为应该由党选她
I think the party should choose her.

637
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,860
你不是说开放党代会吧
Not an open convention.

638
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,190
鲍勃  我们
Look, Bob, let's...

639
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,600
我们必须面对事实
We have to face the fact that

640
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,320
我的健康状况将会对我们非常不利
my health is gonna be a major liability for us.

641
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,060
不论谁做竞选搭档
No matter who becomes the running mate,

642
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,320
那人最终都可能成为总统
they could well end up being president.

643
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,560
那种情况
Now, that is a...

644
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,690
我甚至都不愿想
a scenario that I don't even like to fathom,

645
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,430
但是我们无法回避
but we can't escape it.

646
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,850
如果这个决定如此重要
And if it's such an important decision,

647
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,350
为什么不让党做定夺呢
why not let the party make it?

648
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,210
因为那样大家都可以参选
Because it'd be a free-for-all.

649
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,690
不不  我们要想办法让凯茜获胜
No, no. We make it so that Cathy wins.

650
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,030
只是要做得像是党选择了她
We'll just make it look like the party chose her.

651
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,360
想想新闻报道吧  会铺天盖地的
And think of the coverage. We'll own the news.

652
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,770
你想把党代会变成马戏表演
You want the convention to be a circus.

653
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,260
鲍勃  我不知道你有没有注意到
Oh, Bob, I'm not sure if you've noticed or not,

654
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,030
但政治已经不只是戏剧了  是娱乐业
but politics is no longer just theater, it's show business.

655
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,420
那我们就演一出最棒的戏吧
So let's put on the best show in town.

656
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,610
太好了
Great.

657
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,430
能向我敬个礼吗  将军
Will you give me a salute, General?

658
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,970
现役军人不能接受媒体采访
Active military aren't allowed to speak to the press.

659
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,180
他今天早上辞职了
He delivered his resignation this morning.

660
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,880
不是吧
No shit.

661
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,070
只等总统同意  我们立刻就在网上发布
We're gonna break it online as soon as the president accepts it.

662
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,250
月刊不常得到这种首发猛料吧
Not often a monthly gets raw meat like this, huh?

663
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,080
他的电话会被打爆的
His phone's gonna blow up.

664
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,120
但你会得到独家采访
But you get the exclusive.

665
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,370
-汤姆的事很遗憾  -我不觉得
- Sorry about Tom. - I'm not.

666
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,110
谢谢你  将军
Thank you, General.

667
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,670
好了  我们要准备...
All right, we're gonna go set up for the...

668
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,090
下午好  将军  我是凯特·鲍德温
Good afternoon, General. Kate Baldwin.

669
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,690
我们开始吧
Shall we?

670
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,790
不用说  安德伍德夫人
So, the main issue that Mrs. Underwood

671
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,170
最近关注的主要问题是枪支
has been focusing on is guns, obviously.

672
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,860
我们准备了一些最近在用的谈话要点
We've got some talking points we've been using,

673
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,280
-你想  -抱歉  有水吗
- so you'll want to... - I'm sorry, is there any water?

674
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,070
有
Yes.

675
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,150
我有点宿醉
I'm a bit hungover.

676
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,400
至少现在清醒了
At least I'm not still drunk.

677
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,360
要来点吗
Want some?

678
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,110
不用
Uh, we're fine.

679
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,930
好
Right.

680
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,480
那么
So...

681
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,320
谈话要点
to the talking points.

682
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,640
什么事
What is it?

683
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,020
几位容我失陪一下
Excuse me for a moment, gentlemen.

684
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,170
我最想说的  是死亡人数
What I want to communicate mostly is about the death toll,

685
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,240
个人经历  以及那些能打动...
with personal stories, things that connect with--

686
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,250
克莱尔
Claire.

687
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,240
-汤姆  -总统先生
- Tom. - Mr. President.

688
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,130
能谈谈吗
Can we speak?

689
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,520
那么  你们两个继续
I'll, uh... I'll leave you to it.

690
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,850
她真的在乎什么枪支问题吗
Does she actually give a shit about guns?

691
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,080
她在不在乎有什么关系
What's that got to do with anything?

692
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,080
我们知道会有这种可能
We knew this was a possibility.

693
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,600
他会闹出很大动静  肯定是康威搞的鬼
He's gonna make a lot of noise. It's Conway, I'm sure of it.

694
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,580
问题不在康威  而是莉安
Problem isn't Conway, it's LeAnn.

695
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,250
是她强力主张取消空袭的
She pressured us to cancel the air strike.

696
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,640
已经做出的决定  就不要多想了  道格
We chose our path, Doug. Let's not second-guess it.

697
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,350
请原谅  安德伍德夫人  但是她有害
No offense, Mrs. Underwood, but she's doing damage.

698
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,460
我认为应该踢掉她
I think we should replace her.

699
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,620
我们要通过枪支法案就得靠她
She's the reason we're gonna pass the gun bill.

700
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,190
先生  《名利场》主编戴娜·崔斯特
Sir? I just got this from Dana Treister,

701
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,610
刚给我发来了这个
the editor of Vanity Fair.

702
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,140
我不确定是什么意思
Not sure what it means...

703
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,680
他打算把这老混蛋定为竞选搭档
He's gonna make that son of a bitch his running mate.

704
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,210
-什么情况  -我去查查这个人
- What's goin' on? - I'll see what I can dig up on him.

705
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,380
不  他当初担任
No. He was fully vetted

706
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,740
参联会主席时已经彻底审查过了
when he was commissioned for the Joint Chiefs.

707
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,860
你和赛斯就他的辞职起草一份声明
No, you go with Seth and draft a statement on the resignation.

708
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,700
好  先生
Yes, sir.

709
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,320
-走  -什么情况  道格
- Let's go. - What's going on, Doug?

710
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,670
都怨莉安
And it's LeAnn's fault.

711
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,220
要不是她  他根本不会辞职
He never would've resigned if it wasn't for her.

712
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,590
你去查查
See what you can find.

713
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,720
将军吗  总统说不用查了
On the general? The president said we shouldn't.

714
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,690
去查莉安
On LeAnn.

715
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,640
我可不想搀和办公室政治
Hey, I don't wanna get involved in some cage match--

716
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,620
我们不是说过了  你得服从我
I thought we had an understanding. Your obedience.

717
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,530
我尽量去查
I'll see what I can do.

718
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,790
你同意道格吗  你对莉安有疑虑吗
Do you agree with Doug? You're having reservations about LeAnn?

719
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
对汤姆的疑虑比对她要大
Less about her and more about Tom.

720
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,200
不过我说了相信你的判断  我就会相信你
But I told you I trust you on this, so I'm trusting you.

721
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,250
-领导层同意了吗  -他们有疑虑
- Has the leadership agreed yet? - They're skeptical.

722
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,460
我们可以利用这个
We can use this.

723
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,630
先生们  如果你们对
Well, gentlemen, if there was

724
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,870
党代会还有什么疑虑的话  放下吧
any doubt about an open convention, let it go,

725
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,370
因为我们必须把这则新闻盖下去
because we're gonna wanna bury this news.

726
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,460
布洛哈特刚刚辞职了
Brockhart has just resigned.

727
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,840
将军马上就要登上《名利场》的封面了
And the general is about to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair.

728
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,920
想想康威会怎样大加利用吧
Imagine what Conway can do with that.

729
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:09,730
康威  康威  康威

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}1996年出版的小说《风起云涌》(Primary Color)
讲述了一个来自美国南方州的州长竞选总统的故事
故事中的州长有一位非常强势的夫人
还好拈花惹草  与身边其他女性有染
小说于1996年1月出版后引起巨大轰动
占据《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首九周之久
读者很快发现小说是在影射时任总统克林顿和夫人
情节也是以克林顿参加1992年大选时的事件为蓝本
该书出版时作者为"无名氏"  一些人经过文本分析后
认定作者为《时代周刊》专栏作家乔·克莱恩
但克莱恩最初断然否认  直到四年后才公开承认
该书曾于1998年被改编搬上大银幕
