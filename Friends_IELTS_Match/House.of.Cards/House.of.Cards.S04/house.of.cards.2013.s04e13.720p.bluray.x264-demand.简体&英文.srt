-让康威接电话  -你要跟我说话
- Put on Conway. - You will speak to me.

24
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,730
不  我们只跟他谈  否则挂断

But you're smart enough to know that.

31
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,620
重点在于艾哈迈迪
The objective here is Ahmadi,

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,430
这是我想谈的
and that's what I'd like to discuss.

33
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,300
选择权在你
Well, the choice is yours.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,690
你要么满足我们的要求  要么不满足
You either meet our demands or you don't.

35
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,570
我昨晚跟康威州长深谈过
I spoke at length last night with Governor Conway.

36
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,240
我今早本想无视你的电话
I was of a mind to ignore your call this morning,

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,880
但他说服我继续跟你沟通
but he convinced me that we should keep talking.

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,830
是吧  州长
Isn't that right, Governor?

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,980
-我只想寻求和平的解决方案  -我也是
- I just want a peaceful resolution. - As do I.

40
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,090
你想叫上州长  我想叫上艾哈迈迪
You wanted to include the Governor, I want to include Ahmadi.

41
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,380
-你是在拖延  -你不想跟你的领袖说话吗
- You're trying to stall. - You refusing to speak to your leader?

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,850
他在线吗
Is he on now?

43
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,210
你释放米勒一家  我们就让他跟你通话
You release the Millers, then we put him on.

44
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,640
不  你无权谈条件
No, you don't get to dictate terms.

45
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,880
你表现出诚意  我们才会还以诚意
We show good will when you show good will.

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,730
我给你10秒钟重新考虑
I'm giving you ten seconds to reconsider your position.

47
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,990
之后  我们就切断电话
After that, we disconnect the call.

48
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,100
真主的旨意  我们会杀了他们
Insha'Allah. We'll kill them.

49
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,720
10秒钟  现在开始

5秒钟
Five seconds.

51

-结束通话  -一个人质
- End the call. - One hostage.

52
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,760
-三个  -一个
- All three. - One.

53
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,680
把女儿和母亲交出来
Give us the daughter and the mother.

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
不  女孩我们要留下
No, we keep the girl.

55
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,220
你已经两次打通了
You managed to get the president of the United States

56
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,520
美国总统的电话
on the phone not once, but twice.

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,670
你得释放女儿和母亲
You will release the daughter and the mother

58
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,390
否则我再也不会与你联络了
or you will never hear from me again,

59
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,140
而且你会失去与你领袖通话的机会
and you will lose your chance to speak to your leader.

60
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,550
马上说
Tell me now.

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,490
他们挂线了  先生
They've disconnected, sir.

62
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,220
站住
Stop.

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,140
艾哈迈迪先生
Mr. Ahmadi.

64
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,230
你可以在楼上洗澡  衣柜里有干净衣服
You can shower upstairs. There's fresh clothes in the closet.

65
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,770
只有参联会主席和护送他的
The only people who know are the Chairman

66
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,810
海豹突击队队员知道
and the SEALs who escorted him.

67
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,580
-通话线路安全吗  -直通总统办公室
- Do we have a secure line? - Direct to the Oval.

68
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,010
总统先生
Mr. President...

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,370
换了我绝不会同意把艾哈迈迪扯进来
I would have never condoned bringing Ahmadi into this.

70
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,320
幸好  我做决定的依据
Well, lucky for me, I'm not making decisions

71
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,860
不是你会同意什么
based on what you would or would not condone.

72
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,850
等着我告诉媒体你把话强加于我
Watch me tell the press you put words in my mouth.

73
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,460
随意
Feel free.

74
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,770
但我觉得他们不太可能会相信你
I think they'll have a hard time believing you, though.

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,750
看看你的信息  你的手下肯定一直在给你发邮件
Check your messages. I'm sure your staff's been emailing you.

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,920
安排车送州长和他家人去机场

77
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,000
回纽约一路顺风

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,170
我叫人送来了午餐
I've had lunch brought in.

79
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,740
你肯定挺久没吃过热乎乎的饭菜了
I'm sure it's been quite a while since you've had a hot meal.

80
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,820
-我不会吃的  -你不饿吗
- I won't be eating it. - Aren't you hungry?

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,170
我不想受刑的时候吐出来
I don't wanna get sick while I'm being tortured.

82
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,160
没人会给你用刑  请坐吧
No one's getting tortured. Please, have a seat.

83
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,510
你想要我叫他们放了那家人  是吗
You want me to tell these men to release the family, right?

84
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,760
否则  你就得做你必须做的了
If I don't, you'll do what you have to do.

85
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,620
如果我们是那个意思
Oh, if we had any intention of that,

86
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,840
你就不可能离开关塔那摩
you never would have left Guantanamo.

87
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,900
我也不会来这儿
Nor would I be here.

88
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,150
这是哪里
Where is here?

89
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,930
弗吉尼亚州  政府安全屋
Virginia, in a government safe house.

90
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,380
为什么你来
And why you?

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,910
出于尊敬  由于事情重大
Out of respect... for the gravity of this situation.

92
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,520
我觉得你是想羞辱我
I think your intention is to humiliate me.

93
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,290
我给你提供了衣服  食物
You've been properly clothed, offered food.

94
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,990
怎么羞辱你了
How are we humiliating you?

95
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,350
我坐在一个女人对面
I'm sitting across from a woman.

96
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,540
没必要装样子了
There's no reason to keep up the facade.

97
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,200
你和你弟弟不是原教旨主义者
You and your brother are not fundamentalists,

98
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,780
也不是叙利亚人
nor are you Syrian.

99
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,560
那是中情局告诉你的吗
This what the CIA's feeding you?

100
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,460
你是伊拉克人  你真名是阿瓦德
You're Iraqi. Your real name is Al Awad.

101
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,220
事实上  这上面说
Actually, it says that

102
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,500
你2000年加入了复兴社会党
you joined the Baath Party in 2000.

103
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,680
你2001年到2002年间是
You were the assistant to the

104
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,130
基建副部长的助理
undersecretary of infrastructure, 2001, 2002.

105
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,620
随你怎么说
Say whatever you want.

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,390
我弟弟会否认  你休想说服除你之外的任何人
My brother will deny. You won't convince anyone but yourselves.

107
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,230
我们驱逐了复兴社会党
We expel the Baathists

108
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,020
你就从官僚变成了极端主义者
and you go from a bureaucrat to an extremist.

109
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,300
但你是个受过高等教育的人  尤瑟夫
But you're a well-educated man, Yusuf...

110
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,380
你才不在乎伊斯兰或哈里发
and you don't care about Islam or the caliphate.

111
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,280
你只是在利用那个刺激士兵情绪
You're just using that to radicalize soldiers.

112
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,380
就像你利用民主和自由那样
Just as you use democracy and freedom.

113
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,050
现在我们理解彼此了
So now we understand each other.

114
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,950
尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪仍被单独监禁在关塔那摩监狱
Yusuf Al Ahmadi remains in solitary confinement in Guantanamo.

115
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,060
如果卡洛琳和梅莉莎·米勒获释
If Caroline and Melissa Miller are released,

116
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,290
我们将允许劫持者在监督下与其通话
we will allow supervised contact with the kidnappers.

117
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,760
马克
Mark.

118
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,940
艾哈迈迪一向鼓励这样的恐怖行动
Ahmadi has consistently encouraged acts of terror like this one.

119
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,240
你为什么认为任何的对话
What makes you think that any sort of dialogue

120
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,060
能带来和平的结果
will lead to a peaceful resolution?

121
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,060
要么就是完全不建立对话
Well, the alternative is no dialogue at all.

122
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,890
我们想用尽一切办法
We don't wanna leave any stone unturned.

123
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,500
莎拉
Sara.

124
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,660
你可否就《华尔街电讯报》的文章
Will you comment on the Wall Street Telegraph article

125
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,560
指出康威州长可能干涉了
about Governor Conway's alleged interference

126
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,980
众议院情报委员会做出评论
with the House Intelligence Committee?

127
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,430
它确认了我们早有怀疑的事
Well, it confirms what we suspected to be true,

128
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,290
但你想听的应该是州长的评论  而非我的
but I think you want the governor's comment, not ours.

129
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,560
沃勒克议员在扭曲事实
Congressman Walleck is misrepresenting events.

130
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,270
-你是说他撒谎了  -我是说他所言不实
- You're saying he lied? - I'm saying he misrepresented.

131
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,560
我在情报委员会有多位朋友
I have a number of friends on the Intelligence Committee,

132
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,310
我是否偶尔跟他们谈话  当然
and do I speak with them sometimes? Of course.

133
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,050
但这跟干涉不是一回事
But that's not the same as interfering.

134
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,210
那么你从未跟委员会成员
So you never discussed the Russia plan

135
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,110
谈论过俄罗斯计划
with anyone on the committee?

136
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,300
我们或许谈论过
We may have discussed it,

137
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,670
但我又没下达命令
but it's not as though I was issuing orders.

138
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,540
而且我得说  大家现在应该首要关注
And I have to say, everyone's primary focus right now

139
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,610
米勒一家  而非此事
needs to be on the Miller family, not this.

140
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,400
总统是否要求你离开白宫
Did the president ask you to leave the White House?

141
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,150
我们都认为我该做的已经做完
Uh, we agreed that I'd done my part,

142
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,720
其他要靠他了
and that the rest is up to him.

143
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,460
能跟我们谈谈昨晚你跟总统
Can you tell us about your conversation last night

144
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,780
关于艾哈迈迪的讨论吗
with the president, regarding Ahmadi?

145
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,240
先说到这儿吧  谢谢大家
That'll be all for now. Thank you so much.

146
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,360
问个问题  先生
Question, sir.

147
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,890
走吧
Let's go.

148
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,180
等等  莉莉的车座还没弄好
Uh, hold on, I'm still fastening Lily's car seat.

149
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,720
-威尔  -别说了
- Will-- - Not a word.

150
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,710
我得说  将军对你说
Well, I have to tell you, the general's apeshit

151
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,130
为自己服役感到羞耻暴跳如雷
over what you said about being ashamed of your service.

152
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,810
他可能会接受采访
He may talk to the press.

153
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,820
没想出如何恰当地回应这堆狗屁
Nobody does any press until we have a proper response

154
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,920
谁都不许接受采访
to all this shit.

155
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,510
爸爸说了  "狗屁"   狗屁  狗屁
Daddy said "Shit." Shit, shit, shit!

156
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,460
住口
Stop it!

157
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,530
你得给我挖到沃勒克的把柄
You need to bring me something on Walleck.

158
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,110
我们得让他信誉扫地
We need to discredit him.

159
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,130
-弄好了没有  -你不用冲我们撒火
- Are you done yet? - You don't need to snap at us.

160
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,810
-好了没有  -好了
- Are you done yet? - Yes.

161
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,020
快走  马上
Let's go. Now.

162
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,480
那是如果他们获释
That's if they're released.

163
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,640
等我们了解了具体情况会把空白处补上
We'll fill in the blanks once we have details.

164
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,170
这是为最糟糕的情况准备的
This is if the worst happens.

165
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,010
耶茨写的吗
Yates wrote these?

166
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,650
不  我先写了一篇
No, I... I took a stab at it first.

167
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
另外  汤姆·汉默施密特打来了
Also, Tom Hammerschmidt called.

168
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,550
他想采访总统
He wants an interview with the president.

169
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,060
不肯说是什么事
He wouldn't say what for.

170
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,600
他现在是哪家的
What outlet is he with now?

171
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,250
他回《先驱报》了  说给你发了邮件
He's back at the Herald. Said he emailed you directly.

172
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,010
让我单独待会儿
I need the room.

173
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,890
都出去
Everyone out.

174
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,260
接《先驱报》
Get me the Herald.

175
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,420
汤姆·汉默施密特
Tom Hammerschmidt.

176
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,970
这里有个手机信号塔
Well, there's a cell tower here.

177
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,030
一般流量不多
Uh, typically very low traffic,

178
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,100
但在来电期间有增加
but it showed higher usage during the time of the call,

179
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,960
尤其是东南天线
especially the southeastern antenna.

180
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,390
那么我们应该能定位热点  锁定位置
So we should be able to ping the hotspot, zero in?

181
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,910
信号塔很多
Eh, it's hundreds of tower faces.

182
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,030
我能说出大致区域
I can give you the general area,

183
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,390
具体定位要更久
but pinpointing will take longer.

184
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,100
而且我无法保证肯定是他们
I can't even guarantee it's gonna be them.

185
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,130
分析每一座塔
I want every one of those towers analyzed.

186
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,040
专注分析背景环境声音会更有收效
Well, we're better off concentrating on ambient background sound.

187
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,570
如果我能把那个跟这一带
If I can match that to other calls made

188
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,540
同一时段内的其他通话匹配上
in this area around the same time as--

189
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,910
我不是在问你的建议
I'm not asking your advice.

190
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,920
我是告诉你该做什么
I'm telling you what I want you to do.

191
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,640
分析信号塔数据
Focus on the tower data.

192
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,510
我们本来关注的是这一带
We were concentrating on this area,

193
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,510
但看来他们更接近这里
but it looks like they're closer to here.

194
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,570
我们安排了地面小队展开了搜查网络
We've got ground teams setting up a search grid.

195
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,780
可以用卫星吗
Can we use satellites?

196
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,040
我们用了  但区域内有数百个
We are, but there are over 100 possible structures

197
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,200
可能建筑
within the zone.

198
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,690
-要逐个搜查  -要多久
- Each one of them needs to be checked. - How long?

199
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,040
如果走运  几小时  要不可能拖到明天
If we get lucky, within hours. If not, could be tomorrow.

200
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,140
先生  斯坦普先生来了
Sir, Mr. Stamper's here.

201
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,470
-他说是急事  -谢谢
- He says it's urgent. - Thank you.

202
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,370
汤姆·汉默施密特说他们今天就会发布
Hammerschmidt says they go online today,

203
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,200
不管您是否做出评价
whether you comment or not.

204
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,980
出行记录不算铁证
Travel logs are not hard evidence.

205
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,830
这些引言都是间接证据
These quotes are circumstantial.

206
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,070
但加在一起  我不知道我们该怎么解释
But all of it combined... I don't know how we spin this.

207
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,070
有分量很重的人愿公开作证
He's got heavy hitters on the record.

208
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,080
要我放出杰姬和雷米的照片吗
Should I release the photos of Jackie and Remy?

209
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,340
他们把外遇的事告诉他了
They told him about the affair.

210
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,310
他要在文章里写我们曾威胁曝光他们
He's putting in the article that we threatened to expose them.

211
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,710
怎么会发生这种事
How did this happen?

212
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,740
你也有责任
This is as much on you.

213
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,950
我可以列出一张他还没找到的人的名单
I can put together a list of the people he hasn't gotten to yet.

214
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,910
让他拿到掩盖的证据吗
And give him proof of a cover-up?

215
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,600
他说得对  如果我们再联络塔斯克或拉尼根
He's right. If we reach out to Tusk or Lanagin--

216
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,170
把汉默施密特叫来
I want Hammerschmidt here.

217
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,250
-先生  我不是说...  -尽快安排
- Sir, I wasn't suggesting-- - Set it up as soon as possible.

218
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,950
美国政府绝不会承认哈里发
The U.S. Government will never recognize the caliphate.

219
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,020
当然
No, of course not.

220
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,180
但我们能让复兴社会党重回政府
But we can reintegrate the Baathists into the government.

221
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,440
什么政府  伊拉克已经没有政府了
What government? There's no government in Iraq.

222
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,090
伊拉克已经没有了  有巴格达
There is no Iraq. There's Baghdad.

223
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,760
什叶派  逊尼派  库尔德派
Shia, Sunni, Kurd...

224
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,520
叙利亚也是如此
Syria is the same.

225
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,970
我们驱逐你们之前  你们维持了秩序
You maintained order before we shut you out.

226
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,210
我们不能支持神政
Now, we can't support a theocracy,

227
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,030
但我们可以让军队重新掌权
but we can put the military back in control.

228
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,880
我们招募的士兵怎么办
What do we do with all the soldiers we've recruited?

229
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,200
他们不会接受世俗国家
They won't accept a secular government.

230
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,030
你要管好他们
You'll keep them in check.

231
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,340
如果有必要  靠武力
With force, if necessary.

232
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,470
冲替我们扛枪的人开枪吗
Use our guns on the men who carried it for us.

233
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,050
那又如何  如果你能重新掌权的话
What does it matter... if you have back your power?

234
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,940
如果你们真这么打算  为什么不公开说
If this is your intention, why have you said nothing publicly?

235
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,730
因为你知道这一切
Because you know that all of this

236
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,700
只能闭门商量
has to be done behind closed doors.

237
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,210
我们得表现得像是我们消灭了哈里发国
We need to give the appearance that we neutralized ICO.

238
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,710
如果他们不释放人质呢
What happens if they don't release the hostages?

239
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,490
那你回古巴
Well, then you go back to Cuba.

240
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,470
如果他们放了人质  我们就让你跟他们通话
If they do, then we put you on the phone with them...

241
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,940
你叫他们把第三名人质也放掉
and you tell them to release the third.

242
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,730
然后你还是会送我回古巴
And then you send me back to Cuba anyway.

243
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,890
我明白你为什么不信任我们
I do understand why you don't trust us,

244
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,260
但另一个选择呢
but what is the alternative?

245
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,880
他们死了  我们就更有理由
These people die, and then it gives us all the justification we need

246
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,520
全面进攻
for a full offensive.

247
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,210
那得要很多年
That's years...

248
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,730
而且你休想完全消灭我们
and you won't completely destroy us.

249
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,980
不能完全  但也足以让你们不值一提
Not completely, but enough to make you irrelevant.

250
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,160
我们也可以悄悄合作
Or we can quietly work together.

251
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,520
哈里发国消亡  你和你的将军们得到大权
ICO fades, and you and your generals get control.

252
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,730
-知道克莱尔在哪吗  -不  我们在找她呢
- Do you know where Claire is? - No, we're trying to find her.

253
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,620
她如果要去哪一般会告诉我
She usually keeps me informed if she's going somewhere.

254
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,090
你问过特勤局吗
Have you asked Secret Service?

255
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,080
-他们不知道  -他们肯定知道
- They didn't know. - They have to know.

256
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,120
我再去问问
I'll go ask again.

257
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,270
谢谢
Thanks.

258
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,510
她不在宅邸
She wasn't at the residence.

259
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,050
-你还去了那儿  -十分钟前
- You went up there? - Ten minutes ago.

260
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,670
你俩到底怎么回事
What's going on between you two?

261
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,290
你以为我没发现吗
You think I haven't noticed?

262
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,980
你俩说话的样子  你来得多勤
How you two talk? How often you're here?

263
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,280
我都不能随随便便进出宅邸
I don't even have unrestricted access to the residence.

264
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,620
她母亲死时  我陪在她身边
I was with her when her mother died.

265
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,200
这让我们变得亲近
It made us close.

266
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,420
你不要想太多
Don't read too much into it.

267
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,580
不管你们有多亲近
Well, however close you are,

268
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,550
只要别让外人想太多就好
just make sure that nobody else can read too much into it.

269
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,490
等你见到克莱尔  告诉她我回家了
Well, if you see Claire, tell her I went home.

270
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,220
如果她想找我的话
If she needs me.

271
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,420
不要和他面谈
Don't meet face-to-face.

272
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,350
让他以书面形式把问题传给你
Have him submit the questions in writing.

273
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,030
但如果我见他  也许能让他先停停
Yeah, but if I meet with him, maybe I can give him pause.

274
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,580
不  他是想诓你露出马脚
No, he's trying to trap you into giving something away.

275
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,940
那绝不可能
That's not going to happen.

276
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,920
-真是挑了个好时候  -你那边如何
- The timing on this-- - How's your end?

277
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,870
就要说通他了
He's getting there.

278
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,280
你集中精力对付他  我对付哈默施密特
Well, you focus on him. I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

279
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,070
你在抽烟吗
Are you smoking?

280
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,950
-你怎么知道  -我能听见
- How did you know? - I can hear it.

281
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,220
如果这报道出来
If this story comes out,

282
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,650
害死我们的不会是烟
it won't be the smoking that does us in.

283
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,940
他们被杀了吗
Have they been killed?

284
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,780
你好像不高兴
You look upset.

285
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,760
你想你妻子吗
Do you miss your wife?

286
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,240
你才不在乎我妻子
You don't care about my wife.

287
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,730
你们夫妻俩我都不在乎
Ah, I don't care about either of you...

288
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,700
你们或是你们的孩子是死是活  我都不在乎
whether you live or die... or your children do.

289
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,140
但如果每月让你和家人通一次话能说通你
But if speaking to your family once a month will get us there,

290
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,710
我会考虑的
I'll put that on the table.

291
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,470
我已经三年没见过我妻子了
I haven't seen my wife in three years.

292
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,470
我从来没见过我儿子  我女儿根本不记得我
I have a son I've never met, a daughter that doesn't remember me.

293
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,230
这是我们选择的路
This is our path.

294
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,320
哪怕他们被杀吗
Even if they're killed?

295
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,760
是的
Yes.

296
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,330
他们会被杀的
Because they will be.

297
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,210
我不惜一死  他们也是一样
I'm willing to die, and so are they.

298
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,040
-这是他们的选择吗  -什么选择
- Would they have made that choice? - What choice?

299
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,430
他们只知道你们的炸弹
All they've known are your bombs.

300
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,230
一弹下来  人没了
Poof, gone.

301
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,660
我们的厉害之处
We're effective

302
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,310
就在于我们让你们感受到了那痛苦
because we make you feel the pain.

303
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,090
而我们一生都在承受这种痛苦
We've felt it all our lives.

304
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,680
进
Yes?

305
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,650
-汤姆  -总统先生
- Tom. - Mr. President.

306
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,100
我得说明白  今天我们的谈话不能公开
I'm gonna ask that everything we discuss today is off the record.

307
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,660
-明白  -上次我们见面的时候
- Understood. - Now, the last time we met,

308
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,150
是在副总统办公室
it was in the vice president's office,

309
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,810
你指控我靠操纵马修斯当上了副总统
and you claim that I acquired that office by manipulating Matthews.

310
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,720
指控你的不是我  是沃克总统
I don't claim that. President Walker does.

311
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,890
是啊  那个自食苦果心怀怨愤的男人
Oh, yes. A man made bitter by his own mistakes.

312
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,710
你还声称  我靠阴谋赶走了他
And you also claim that I then acquired this office

313
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,540
才坐上了总统之位
by pushing out that very same man.

314
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,430
-丹顿和夏普证实了此事  -是吗
- Danton and Sharp corroborated. - Oh, yes.

315
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,590
这两个人和我有很深的宿怨
Two people with very big chips on their shoulders,

316
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,860
无非是想给他们的出轨编个借口罢了
fabricating all this nonsense to justify their infidelity.

317
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,410
你是说你没胁迫过他们
You're saying you didn't blackmail them?

318
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,780
我曾对许多人施压  汤姆
I pressure a lot of people, Tom.

319
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,910
这是政治的一部分
That's part of politics.

320
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,410
但从没威胁过他们
But never those two.

321
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,500
丹顿的父母说
Danton's parents say

322
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,470
莉安·哈维去过他们在迈阿密的家
LeAnn Harvey came to their house in Miami.

323
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,370
那应该是他想拉拢莉安支持他的俄罗斯计划
Well, I imagine that's because he wanted LeAnn on the Russian plan.

324
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,240
那为什么是她上门  而不是他去找她
Then why did she come to him instead of him coming to her?

325
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,870
我不想跟你纠结这些细枝末节
Look, I'm not gonna get into the weeds on this,

326
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,550
我们还是直说了吧
but let's just cut to the chase.

327
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,120
你现在提出的这些指控
The allegations that you're making

328
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,110
就和你第一次见我时所说的一样都是胡扯
are just as ludicrous as they were the first time we met.

329
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,130
我当时没什么确凿证据  这回我有了
I had nothing concrete then. This time I do.

330
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,740
就光那三个急于报复我的人
Three people with an ax to grind,

331
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,540
出行记录  连点干货都没有吗
no hard evidence and some travel logs?

332
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,340
这算什么"确凿"证据
I'd hardly call that concrete.

333
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,500
写报道已经够了
It's enough for a story.

334
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,000
你这简直是凭空捏造
You're floating an idea out of thin air.

335
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,380
让我戳穿你的真实意图吧  你就是想趁大选
Let's just call this what it is: blatant sensationalism

336
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,910
-搞个大新闻哗众取宠  -我没有捏造
- tied to the election-- - I don't float.

337
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,090
...哗众取宠来提升你们的发行量
tied to an election to boost your circulation

338
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,900
因为《先驱报》的读者在大量流失
because the Herald is losing readership.

339
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,200
先生  我决不会捏造故事试探风向
Sir, I don't float stories to see if they're seaworthy,

340
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,530
我对发行量更是毫不在乎
and I don't give a shit about circulation.

341
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,690
我现在只关心真相
The only thing I care about is the truth.

342
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,540
真相  那你联系雷蒙德·塔斯克
The truth? So have you reached out to Raymond Tusk

343
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,820
要他评论了吗  或是丹尼尔·拉尼根
for a comment? Or Daniel Lanagin?

344
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,860
我可没看见他们的引述
I don't see their quotes in here.

345
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,970
如果你真的要查真相
I mean, if you're going for the truth,

346
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,570
难道不该查得全面一点  公正一点吗
doesn't that include being thorough? Being balanced?

347
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,640
所以我才想给你机会就此事发表评论
Which is why I'm giving you an opportunity to comment.

348
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,980
那有没有国会议员
And what about any members of Congress?

349
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,460
我也没看见他们的话
I don't see their quotes in here.

350
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,930
相信等文章发布  他们会接我的电话的
I'm sure they'll answer my calls once this article comes out.

351
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,600
我看你压根不敢打给他们
Oh, I think you're afraid to make those calls,

352
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,040
因为你知道他们会看穿报道的实质
'cause you know they'll see this for what it is...

353
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,310
全无根据的小报八卦
unsupported tabloid gossip.

354
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,530
助理党鞭  你的前幕僚长
The assistant whip, your former Chief of Staff,

355
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,290
外加一位美国前总统
an ex-president of the United States.

356
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,350
这可不是八卦  这是新闻
That's not gossip. It's news.

357
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,310
司法部肯定会展开听证调查的
There's no way the Justice Department doesn't open up an inquiry.

358
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,830
就算司法部无视  国会的共和党也不会放过
And if they don't, the Republicans in Congress will.

359
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,500
随你贬低我  但你知道这事会是什么结果
Downplay this all you want, but you know where this story leads.

360
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,900
我知道这是怎么回事
I know what this story is.

361
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,540
政治陷害  就这么简单
Political sabotage, plain and simple.

362
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,230
玛格丽特·蒂尔顿以前可没这么下作  汤姆
Margaret Tilden used to have some integrity, Tom.

363
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,860
你也是
And so did you.

364
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,670
你为什么要浪费全国人民的时间
Why are you wasting America's time with this,

365
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,480
非挑眼下这个危急关头
in the middle of this crisis?

366
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
你的良心哪去了
Where is your conscience?

367
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,510
我也想问你这个问题
That's the question I want you to answer.

368
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,100
什么事
Yes?

369
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,450
先生  他们把母女俩的地址发过来了
Sir, they emailed a location of the mother and daughter.

370
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,210
麻烦把汉默施密特先生带去罗斯福室
Will you please show Mr. Hammerschmidt into the Roosevelt Room?

371
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,400
不用了  我这就走
There's no need. I'll be going.

372
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,300
那可不行  咱俩话还没说完呢  汤姆
Oh, no, no, no. You and I are not done, Tom.

373
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,000
卡洛琳和梅莉沙·米勒已于
Caroline and Melissa Miller were rescued

374
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,180
东部时间12:30左右被联调局外勤探员解救
at approximately 12:30 Eastern Standard Time by FBI field agents.

375
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,510
除了绑架造成的精神创伤之外
Aside from the psychological trauma of their ordeal,

376
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,990
两人健康状况良好
both are unharmed and healthy.

377
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,540
我马上会联系她们  她们接受体检后
I'll be calling them soon, and I hope to meet them soon,

378
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,440
我希望能尽快见到她们
once they have had their full medical examinations.

379
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,280
虽然我对母女二人平安感到宽慰
And while I am greatly relieved to have them both safe,

380
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,580
但詹姆斯·米勒仍处境危险
James Miller remains in danger.

381
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,000
我们将拼尽全力  争取我能再在这个讲台上
And we will not rest until I can come to this podium

382
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,740
发布这样的好消息
and make another announcement like this one,

383
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,050
向各位通报他的平安
informing you of his safe return.

384
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,470
格雷森先生将继续回答各位的问题
Mr. Grayson will answer any questions you may have.

385
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,840
我得回去主持营救了  谢谢各位
I must get back to work. Thank you all very much.

386
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,420
他们还活着  多少有你点功劳
They're alive. You can take some credit for that.

387
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,230
安德伍德肯定正把她们接去白宫
I'm sure Underwood's flying them to the White House right now.

388
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,550
人人都会记住这个镜头
That's the image everyone will remember.

389
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,250
热烈的拥抱  安抚的话语
The warm embrace, the reassuring words.

390
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,540
他一点功劳都不会分给我的
I mean, he's not gonna let me take one ounce of credit for this.

391
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,340
如果她们愿意见媒体的话
If they choose to talk with the media, however,

392
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,610
我们肯定会进行安排
we will certainly facilitate that.

393
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,840
现在请各位提问
I will now take some of your questions.

394
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,830
如果我和莉莉被绑了呢
What if it were Lily and me?

395
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,010
威尔  如果是我和莉莉被绑架了呢
Will, what if it were me and Lily?

396
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,230
你也会这么考虑吗
Would this be your thinking?

397
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,880
-"政治影响"  -别  汉娜
- "The political fallout"? - Don't, Hannah.

398
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,920
别突然变软弱了
Don't get weak on me.

399
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,520
我可以确认我们的重点搜索区域在那里
I can confirm that that is an area where our focus is,

400
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,260
但我只能说到这一步了
but that's about as much detail as I can go into.

401
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,510
绑匪和你们联系了吗
Have the kidnappers made contact?

402
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,060
如果联系了
And if so,

403
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,530
你们让他们和艾哈迈迪对话了吗
did you put them in touch with Ahmadi?

404
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,500
他们尚未联系我们  我们敦促他们尽快联系
They have not made contact. We encourage them to do so.

405
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,420
而且我方的提议仍然有效
And, yes, the offer still stands.

406
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,860
-玛丽  -你们凭什么确信
- Mary. - Uh, what assurances do you have

407
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,630
艾哈迈迪会照你们的意思进行对话
that Ahmadi will say what you want him to?

408
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,490
我们不能确信  也不能强迫他
We don't, and we can't force him to.

409
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,970
但我们希望他能和我们合作
But we're hoping that he will work with us on this.

410
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,370
古巴那边是谁负责监督他进行通话
Who's managing the call from his side in Cuba?

411
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,410
抱歉  我不能透露
I'm sorry, I can't go into details on that.

412
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,030
虽然母女俩都被蒙了眼
Both were blindfolded in the car,

413
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,590
但母亲估计他们开了45分钟的车
but the mother estimates a drive time of 45 minutes.

414
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,300
这就使搜索范围缩小到六栋建筑
That narrows the search to six structures.

415
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,340
也许他们已经逃跑了
Unless they're on the move.

416
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,730
即便他们穿过了路障
If they're past the roadblocks already,

417
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,230
那也得停下来打电话
they've gotta stop somewhere to make the call.

418
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,640
我们追踪电话取得了进展
And we've had some progress on tracing the call.

419
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,820
你们把我的算法都拿去了
You're taking my algorithms.

420
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,360
我们需要更多人手  而这里又坐不下
We need more teams on this. There is not enough room here.

421
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,320
你知道我接到命令是
You know my instructions were

422
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,970
任何东西都不能离开这栋楼
never to let anything leave this building.

423
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,450
而我们有局长的直接命令
We have an order from the director.

424
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,510
如果你们让更多人搀和进来会造成混乱的
Well, if you put more teams on this, it'll cause confusion.

425
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,100
回家吧  麦卡伦先生  你在这儿熬两天了
Go home, Mr. Macallan. You've been here for two days straight.

426
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,720
我决不会把这事交给
I am not leaving this in the hands of people

427
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,200
不清楚情况的人
who do not know what they're doing.

428
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,530
我们能行
We've got it covered.

429
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,400
回家休息吧  需要的话会联系你的
Go home. Get some rest. We'll let you know if we need you.

430
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,900
这两个小子并不想杀人
These boys don't wanna kill anyone.

431
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,360
否则  就不会释放两名人质
If they did, they wouldn't have released two hostages.

432
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,500
他们其实是在找台阶下
They're actually looking for an excuse to back out.

433
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,830
如果对话视频上了电视  我就成了叛徒
If the media plays that video, I look like a traitor.

434
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,570
我们告诉他们这是前提条件
We tell them it's a precondition.

435
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,740
要是他们敢泄露  协议就取消
If they share it, the deal is off.

436
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,200
我怎么知道你不会泄露呢
How do I know you won't?

437
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,570
我不能逼你相信我
I can't force you to believe me...

438
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,570
但我们只需几小时就能找到他们
but we are hours from finding them.

439
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,160
你知道规矩
And you know how this goes.

440
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,050
要是吉姆·米勒死了  他们也会死
Jim Miller dies. They die.

441
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,570
你回古巴  我们开战
You go back to Cuba. We go to war.

442
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,080
我们已经在交战了
We're already at war.

443
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,800
尤瑟夫  你有一次
Yusuf, you have one chance

444
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,780
改变家乡情况的机会
to change the conditions at home.

445
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,750
你浪费机会  就毁了你为之奋斗过的一切
You squander it, you destroy everything you have ever fought for.

446
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,980
你知道奋斗的滋味吗
What do you know about fighting for anything?

447
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,290
我们说完了  把他押回去
We're done here. Send him back.

448
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,280
好吧
All right.

449
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,480
我照你说的做
I'll do what you ask.

450
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,170
给他穿上囚服  我们在地下室拍
Put him back in his jumpsuit. We'll film in the basement.

451
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,090
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,840
告诉参议员  我回来就给他打电话
Tell the senator I'll call him when I get back.

453
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,060
-总统先生  -凯茜
- Mr. President. -Oh, Cathy.

454
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,890
我知道我们都没机会讨论这一切
I realize we haven't had a chance to discuss everything.

455
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,220
等到把人质救出来
We'll talk foreign policy consequences

456
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,670
我们就讨论外交政策的后果
once we've resolved this hostage situation.

457
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,090
不是那事  《先驱报》联系我了
It's not that. The Herald contacted me.

458
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,100
一名记者打到我办公室  我读过邮件了
A reporter called my office. I've read the email.

459
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,560
-你没给他们回电  -当然没
- You didn't call them back? - 'Course not.

460
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,790
好  什么都别做也别说  我来处理
All right. Don't do or say anything. I'll handle it.

461
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,500
-怎么处理  -我还不知道
- How? - I don't know yet.

462
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,020
沃克说我们同谋拿下了国务卿之位
Walker says we conspired for Secretary of State,

463
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,980
还说我在调查中庇护他
and saying I gave him asylum during the investigation.

464
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,230
要是他们发布这些  我也会被活剥
If they publish this, I get skinned alive, too.

465
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,690
我们会没事的  凯茜  相信我
We're going to be all right, Cathy. Trust me on this.

466
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
我刚和国务卿杜兰特谈过
I just spoke with Secretary Durant.

467
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,490
我们定好了时间
We have a timeline.

468
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,420
同事们要是没我的消息
My folks don't hear from me,

469
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,130
就开始在整点打电话
they start making calls on the hour.

470
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,450
先打给杜兰特
Durant was first.

471
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,670
再打给博奇
Birch is next.

472
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,270
然后是乌麦克
Then Womack.

473
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,500
接着是迈克尔·科恩
Michael Kern.

474
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,910
佐伊的文章毁了他的机会
It was Zoe's article that ruined his chances.

475
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,030
你认识她  你去过她家附近
You knew her. You were in her neighborhood.

476
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,780
这不负责任  汤姆
This is irresponsible, Tom.

477
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,870
整个国家正受到恐怖主义的重大威胁
When the whole nation is in the middle of this major terror threat.

478
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,100
独裁者们也是这套逻辑
That's the same reasoning dictators use.

479
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,950
你让我想到凯特·鲍德温
You remind me a little bit of Kate Baldwin.

480
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,700
你失去了客观性
You've lost your objectivity.

481
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,790
你竟然提到她  真是有趣
Uh, it's funny you mention her.

482
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,270
凯特认为卢卡斯有所发现  我让她别管
Kate thought Lucas was onto something. I told her to let it go,

483
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,850
因为什么都没有  但其实有
that there wasn't anything there, but there was.

484
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,320
那事实在哪  事实  不是引言  事实
Well, where are the facts? Facts, not quotes. Facts.

485
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,790
你想看事实
You wanna see a fact?

486
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,880
这就是事实
This is a fact.

487
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,470
我告诉你他疯了  这就是证据
I told you he was crazy, and there's the proof.

488
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,820
他把事实搞错了  但他的方向是对的
He had the facts wrong, but he had the story right.

489
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,720
他看透了你
He saw through you.

490
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,960
什么方向  我是个心理变态
So what is the story? That I'm some sort of psychopath?

491
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,920
我是个杀人犯
That I'm a killer?

492
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,230
我从不相信你是个杀人犯  现在也不信
Oh, I never believed you were a murderer, and I still don't.

493
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,670
但我越来越难以不去考虑这种可能性
But it's becoming harder not to entertain the thought.

494
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,500
那我要不要给你把枪  好让你也来射杀我
Well, should I get you a gun, so you can shoot me, too?

495
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,070
他说中了你的灵魂
He was right about your soul.

496
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,550
说中了你骨子里的东西
What's in your bones.

497
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,550
你残酷无情  腐化不堪
That you're ruthless. You're corrupt.

498
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,000
阻拦你的东西  你一律摧毁
You destroy whatever's in your path.

499
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,170
有哪个总统不符合你这番描述
Name me a president you wouldn't describe in exactly the same way.

500
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,190
我们都残酷无情  都摧毁事物
We're all ruthless. We all destroy.

501
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,590
至于腐败  那就是视角问题了
But corruption? That's a matter of perspective.

502
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,900
不
No.

503
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,990
是法律问题
It's a matter of law.

504
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,890
行了  你现在有点乱  汤姆
All right, you seem a little confused here, Tom.

505
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,240
上一秒还在谈我的灵魂
One moment you're talking about my soul,

506
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,490
下一秒就跳到法律
and the next moment you want to get legal.

507
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,550
我们今天至少说明白点什么  好吗
Let's at least achieve some clarity here today, shall we?

508
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
你想要事实真相吗
You want the real story?

509
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,230
佐伊·巴恩斯
Zoe Barnes?

510
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,290
对  我们在工作上有交集
Yes, we knew each other. Professionally.

511
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,870
我们互相帮忙
I scratched her back and she scratched mine.

512
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,520
是你把这些印出来的
And you printed all of it.

513
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,000
你是她教育法案时的线人
You were her source for the education bill.

514
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,550
-还有迈克尔·科恩  -你拆他台
- And Michael Kern. - You sabotaged him.

515
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,450
问问你自己  我为什么要做那些事
Okay, ask yourself why I would have done all those things.

516
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,770
因为那个教育法案太糟糕了
Because the education bill was a disaster,

517
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,940
我必须得帮总统跳出泥潭
and I had to move the president off of it.

518
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,360
因为迈克尔·科恩是个糟糕的国务卿人选
Because Michael Kern was a terrible choice for Secretary of State.

519
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,760
我们应该选个更好的  也确实选出来了  凯茜
We could do better, and we did, with Cathy.

520
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,370
我是在帮沃克
I was trying to help Walker.

521
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,860
我是在引导一位软弱的总统走上正途
I was trying to steer a weak president in the right direction.

522
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
你要是想发表这些  尽管发表好了
Now, you want to print that story, you go right ahead.

523
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,510
但是其余的部分都是胡扯
But the rest of it is just nonsense.

524
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,230
你没和雷蒙德·塔斯克达成任何协议
You didn't make any deals with Raymond Tusk?

525
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,750
-绝对没有  -那你为什么赦免他
- Absolutely not. - Then why did you pardon him?

526
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,040
和我赦免了沃克是一个原因
Same reason I pardoned Walker.

527
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,870
因为这个国家必须向前看
Because the country had to move on.

528
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,010
弹劾的事不是你策划的
You didn't orchestrate his impeachment?

529
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,350
我为什么会想弹劾一位
Why would I want to impeach a president

530
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,090
我拼命辅佐的总统呢
I was working so hard to help?

531
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,050
你还在这儿  他却不在了
You're still here. He's not.

532
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,370
我曾尽力阻止他毁掉自己
I was trying to save him from himself.

533
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,410
很不幸  我失败了
Unfortunately, I failed.

534
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,150
-你相信自己的直觉吗  汤姆  -一直都信
- Do you trust your instincts, Tom? - I always have.

535
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,330
那你看着我的眼睛
Then look me in the eye.

536
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,490
我告诉你的是真相
I've told you the truth.

537
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,990
你说的话
What you said...

538
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,810
算公开声明吗
is it on the record now?

539
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,800
你相信我吗
Do you believe me?

540
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,870
一点都不信
Not for a second.

541
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,190
那就不算  一个字都不算
Then, no. Not a word.

542
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,250
我们会给你几个小时准备正式回应
We'll give you a few hours if you want to make an official comment.

543
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,280
我可以走了
I'm ready to go now.

544
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,820
如果他们放了那位父亲  你就是个英雄
If they release the father, you're a hero.

545
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,990
还不够  我不知道我们该怎么处理这篇报道
It's not enough. I don't know how we survive this story.

546
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,700
我脑子在不停地转  一遍遍翻来覆去地想
My mind keeps racing, over and over and over again.

547
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,440
本可以处理得更好的事
What we could've done differently.

548
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,680
本可以掩盖的线索
How we could've covered our tracks.

549
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,590
本应搞好的关系
The people we should've kept closer...

550
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,220
我害怕  克莱尔
I'm frightened, Claire.

551
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,830
如果我们不能防止损失
If we can't stop the damage,

552
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,880
就必须止损  弗兰西斯
we have to control it, Francis.

553
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,190
办法是有的  总是有的
There is a solution. There always is.

554
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,510
稍等
Hold on.

555
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,170
他们打来了  先生
They're on, sir.

556
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,510
我们刚收到消息
We just got word.

557
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,480
-他们打来了  -是的  我也刚刚得知
- They've called in. - Yes, I was just told.

558
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,130
好吧  先处理这件事  一件一件来吧
All right, this first. One thing at a time.

559
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,490
-连好了吗  -是的  夫人
- The link is up? - Yes, ma'am.

560
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,950
我们已经找到了那栋建筑
We've located the building.

561
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,610
符合卡洛琳·米勒的描述
Matches the description from Caroline Miller

562
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,370
也符合到她们释放地点的驾车时间
and the drive time from where they were found.

563
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,090
我们确定他们在那儿吗
Are we certain that they're there?

564
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,360
不  先生  但我们有一队人马在赶去了
No, sir, but we have a team en route.

565
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,690
看看一会儿的通话情况如何
Let's see how the phone call goes,

566
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,580
然后我们再决定是否行动
and then we'll decide if we're gonna move.

567
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,710
开始连线了
The line is open.

568
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,700
接通吧
Go ahead.

569
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,360
-我是总统  -艾哈迈迪呢
- This is the president. - Where's Ahmadi?

570
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,900
一会儿就让他视频连线
We're about to connect him via video,

571
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,430
这样你就知道他可以自由发言
so you know that he's speaking freely.

572
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,070
但是连线之前  记住
But before we do, be aware

573
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,560
如果你们把这段通话泄露给媒体
that if you release any of this call to the media,

574
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,210
我们讨论过的所有提议都会作废
anything we discuss will be off the table.

575
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,820
接通他
Put him on.

576
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,130
真主保佑
Assalam-alaikum.

577
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,310
真主也保佑你
Walaikum-assalam.

578
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,250
我知道你们在试图营救我
I know you are trying to free me.

579
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,980
说英语
English.

580
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,140
听我说
Listen to me.

581
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,770
你们已经完成了使命
You've already done your duty.

582
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,360
你们已经引起了世界的注意
You have made the world pay attention.

583
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,600
但是美国政府不会释放我的
But the U.S. Government, they will not free me.

584
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,280
如果你们伤害了这个人
And if you harm this man,

585
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,760
他们会让穆斯林流更多的血
they'll bring more bloodshed on Muslims.

586
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,520
放了他吧
Let him go.

587
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,800
他们向我保证只以绑架罪起诉你们
They have promised me they will only charge you for kidnapping...

588
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,490
而不是恐怖袭击
not as terrorists.

589
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,010
你是受迫这么说的吗
Are they forcing you to say this?

590
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,170
不是
No.

591
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,270
你在看谁
Who are you looking to?

592
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,320
关掉
Off.

593
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,580
他们挂了
They've hung up.

594
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,250
他刚刚说了什么
What did he just say?

595
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,570
你刚才说了什么
What did you say?

596
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,170
告诉我你说了什么
Tell me what you said.

597
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,750
我不是个叛徒
I'm not a traitor.

598
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,310
把他关在这儿
Keep him down here.

599
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,950
"把视频发布出去
"Release the video.

600
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,530
如果他们不放我回家  就杀了他们
If they don't send me home, kill them.

601
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,720
如果他们找到你  杀了他
If they find you, kill him.

602
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,680
确保你有证据..."  然后就断了
Make sure you have proof that I--" And then it goes black.

603
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,830
现在情况如何  我们并不清楚
Where that leaves us, we don't know right now.

604
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,880
白宫没有向媒体通报  也没有发布声明
The White House has not briefed the press or issued any statement--

605
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,940
我该怎么说
What do I say to this?

606
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,310
-我们什么都不说  -不能不回应
- We say nothing. - No, I can't say nothing,

607
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,620
外面有100多个记者准备破门而入
'cause I got 100 reporters that are about to break down that door.

608
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,010
在了解确切情况前
We are not going to expose ourselves

609
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,780
我们不能暴露自己
until we have something concrete to go on.

610
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,470
等那男的人头落地  还是到时也不说
Like the guy's head rolling? Or are you saying nothing then, too?

611
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,690
《先驱报》那篇文章呢
Or how about the Herald article?

612
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,500
等那发布了  你也准备什么都不说吗
When that comes out, are you gonna say nothing?

613
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,100
赛斯...
Seth...

614
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,130
我可以把自己锁在这个房间里
Look, I will lock myself up in here.

615
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,700
找个地缝钻进去
I'll bury my head in the sand.

616
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,440
但最终  面对那群人的还是我
But eventually, it's me that has to face these people.

617
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,170
-我不能像你一样藏起来  -闭嘴
- All right, I can't hide the way that you-- - Stop.

618
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,160
闭嘴
Stop!

619
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,140
控制好你自己
Keep your shit together.

620
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,760
行吗
Okay?

621
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,080
吃点东西  闭闭眼歇会儿
Eat some food. Rest your eyes for a little bit.

622
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,350
等我有进一步消息了联系你
I'll let you know when I know more.

623
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,000
-先生...  -现在不行
- Oh, sir, a-- - Not now.

624
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,080
-你把他带到这儿来了  -我自己来的
- You brought him here? - I brought myself.

625
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,450
事情很严重  道格
It's serious, Doug.

626
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,080
就绪
Ready.

627
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,660
上  上  上
Go, go, go!

628
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,030
上  上  上  上
Go, go, go, go!

629
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,820
上  上  上
Go! Go! Go!

630
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,090
-安全  -安全
- Clear. - Clear.

631
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,440
安全
Clear.

632
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,710
-屋子是空的  -周围安全
- It's empty. - All clear.

633
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,910
-是空的  先生  -已确认周围安全
- It's empty, sir. - Confirmed. All clear.

634
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,500
-弗兰西斯他们找到了...  -没有
- -Francis, did they find-- - No.

635
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,310
我以为艾哈迈迪会...  
I thought Ahmadi was going to...

636
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,660
已经到这一步了
No, we are where we are.

637
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,350
我们知道他是个风险
We knew it was a risk.

638
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,280
-你还好吗  -我没事
- You okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

639
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,310
我扶你上楼
Let's get you upstairs.

640
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,340
...15分钟前由汤姆·汉默施密特发表
...by Tom Hammerschmidt, 15 minutes ago.

641
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,680
文中提到曾请总统做出评论
In the article, it says the President was asked to comment,

642
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,020
但遭到拒绝
but declined.

643
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,480
文中引用了包括前总统加勒特·沃克
Among those quoted are ex-President Garrett Walker,

644
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,930
众议员杰姬...
Congresswoman Jackie--

645
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,520
你到现在接到了多少电话
How many phone calls have you got so far?

646
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,940
至少30个
Uh, at least 30.

647
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,080
-你呢  -我已经懒得数了
- You? - Ah, I stopped counting.

648
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,820
我们该去哪
Where should we go?

649
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,250
给我个惊喜吧
Surprise me.

650
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,370
不  我们什么都不说
No, we don't say anything.

651
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,010
让他在聚光灯下烧几天
We'll let him burn in the lights for a few days

652
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,300
看看情况如何
and see how this plays out.

653
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,420
然后在每个摇摆州放广告
And then we blanket every swing state with ads.

654
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,880
30秒  没声音  只放标题
Thirty seconds, in silence. Just the headline.

655
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,930
让它沉入人们的脑子里
Let that sink into people's gray matter.

656
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,700
好的  回头聊
Okay. We'll talk soon.

657
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,720
过来  我想给你看个东西
Come here. I wanna show you something.

658
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,470
我还在生气
I'm still upset.

659
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,290
你不能假装什么都没发生过
You can't pretend that nothing's happened.

660
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,530
我不软弱
I am not weak.

661
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,520
我不该那么说  我知道你不
I shouldn't have said that. I know you're not.

662
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,150
我还知道点别的
And here's something else I know.

663
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,110
你就要成为下一位美国第一夫人了
You're gonna be the next First Lady of the United States.

664
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,340
好的  待在办公室
All right, stay in your office.

665
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,170
我待会儿打给你
I'll call you back in a bit.

666
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,910
来点降压药和阿司匹林吧
Some Prinivil and aspirin, please.

667
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,800
已经发布了
It's out?

668
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,770
对
Yes.

669
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,770
麦卡伦找到了道格那儿
Doug's got Macallan with him, too.

670
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,980
他们在扩大他的项目  但不由他负责
They're expanding his program, but without him in charge.

671
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,640
那么我们在那头也不安全
So we're not safe there, either.

672
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,970
如果他...
Well, if he was...

673
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,120
如果是他掌管还好  但不是  所以
if he was there to manage it, but he's not, so...

674
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,640
不  我们不安全
No, we're not safe.

675
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,780
-要我叫萨克逊医生吗  -不必
- Should I call Dr. Saxon? - No, it's not necessary.

676
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,170
-非常感谢  先这样吧  -好的  先生
- Thank you very much. That'll be all. - Yes, sir.

677
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,620
还有三周...
Three weeks...

678
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,460
就要大选了
then the election.

679
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,790
毫无胜算
It's nothing.

680
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,360
然后我们败选
And then we lose.

681
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,780
然后他们调查
And they investigate.

682
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,030
我们的一切...
And everything we...

683
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,490
都毁了
gone.

684
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,250
我觉得
I feel...

685
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,950
麻木
numb.

686
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,320
我也是
I do, too.

687
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,120
我们可以制造时间
We make time.

688
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,030
我们无法把一切逐个击退  弗兰西斯
We can't fight everything off one by one, Francis.

689
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,590
但如果我们让这件事
But if we make this...

690
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,970
为我们所用
we make it work for us.

691
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,510
制造混乱
Create chaos.

692
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,570
不只是混乱
More than chaos.

693
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,540
战争
War.

694
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,370
恐惧
Fear.

695
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,060
恐惧
Fear.

696
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,510
残忍
Brutal.

697
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,170
彻底
Total.

698
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,200
我受够了试图赢取人心
I'm done trying to win over people's hearts.

699
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,500
我们来攻击人心吧
Let's attack their hearts.

700
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,390
我们可以利用恐惧
We can work with fear.

701
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,230
是的  没错
Yes, we can.

702
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,120
你应该换一套西装
You should put on a fresh suit.

703
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,010
海军蓝
The navy blue.

704
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,960
对  就那件
Yes, the navy blue.

705
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,650
-麦卡伦呢  -我们让他回去了
- Where's Macallan? - We sent him home.

706
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,230
好  让他稍安勿躁  我们回头处理
All right, tell him to stay put. We'll tackle that later.

707
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,420
让赛斯联系媒体  一小时后  总统办公室
Have Seth inform the networks. The Oval, one hour.

708
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,550
-需要他起草什么吗  -让汤姆来写
- Do you need him to draft something? - Tom will write it.

709
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,160
-他不在这里  -那把他找来
- He's not here. - Then get him here.

710
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:31,540
你划掉的最后一段是什么
What about the last part that you crossed out?

711
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,040
"哀悼不是恐惧  悲痛不是认输"
Uh, "To mourn is not to fear. To grieve is not to admit defeat."

712
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,340
这段应该保留
You should keep that in.

713
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,300
但那是假定他会死
But it presumes he's going to die.

714
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,510
他就是会死
He is going to die.

715
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,690
我们先和律师谈  然后你再和媒体谈
We talk to the lawyers first, then you can talk to the press.

716
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,270
今天已有几个大金主退出了
I've got major funders pulling out already.

717
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,240
总统应该打电话安抚他们
The President should put in calls to set them at ease.

718
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,520
不  不打电话  竞选事宜暂缓
No. No calls. The campaign's on hold.

719
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,050
那些资金丢了就丢了
We lose that money, so be it.

720
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,900
我们要稳住
We need to stabilize.

721
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,080
我觉得他该去掉哀悼和悲痛那一段
I don't think he should say the part about mourning and grief.

722
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,830
我也觉得  但耶茨说他们想保留
I agree, but Yates said they wanted it back in.

723
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,070
是真的吗
Is it true?

724
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,110
汉默施密特写的那些
What Hammerschmidt wrote?

725
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,410
-是真的吗  -不是
- Is it? - No.

726
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:12,150
这是你不再对我说谎之后
That's the first time you've lied to me...

727
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,180
第一次又对我说谎了
since you stopped lying to me.

728
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,670
美国同胞们  过去两年里
My fellow Americans, over the past two years,

729
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,550
特别是过去的几天  几小时里
certainly within the last several days and hours,

730
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,330
我都在自问  "做总统意味着什么
I have asked myself, "What does it mean to be President?

731
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,110
真正的领袖是什么样的"
What does true leadership look like?"

732
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,880
随着11月临近  你们很多人
It's a question many of you have asked yourselves

733
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,980
也在自问这个问题
as November approaches.

734
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,900
我现在坐在这间办公室的这把椅子上
Right now, as I sit in this chair, in this office,

735
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,750
在这里  我那么多前辈们
where so many of my predecessors

736
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,020
曾带领我们国家走过动荡
have steered our nation through turbulent times...

737
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,670
我发现这份工作
I realize that this job

738
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,580
是在政治游戏和华丽言辞之上的
is one that transcends politics and rhetoric.

739
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,580
坐在这个位置的人  肩负着的
Entrusted to anyone who sits behind this desk

740
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:10,280
是更为基本的东西  我们民族的生存
is something far more elemental, the very survival of our nation.

741
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,580
而我作为你们的总统  必须直面眼前的风暴
And I, as your President, must confront the storm before us.

742
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,650
这风暴便是恐怖主义
That storm is terror.

743
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,920
它比任何飓风都更加危险  不可预知
More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane.

744
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,960
它在国外威胁着我们
It has endangered us abroad.

745
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,380
在国内也威胁着我们
It has endangered us at home.

746
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,810
而现在  它让詹姆斯·米勒
And right now, it has placed James Miller

747
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,950
处于最危险的境地中
in the gravest of dangers.

748
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,850
我们曾尝试与劫持者沟通
We attempted to communicate with his captors.

749
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,850
我们本希望争取一个和平的解决方案
We hoped for a peaceful solution.

750
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,920
我们庆幸
We're relieved that

751
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,970
卡洛琳和梅莉莎·米勒现在平安无事
Caroline and Melissa Miller are safe and sound.

752
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,770
但恐怖分子是蛮不讲理的
But terror is blind to reason.

753
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,210
在放弃恐怖的机会面前
Given the opportunity to renounce terror,

754
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,430
尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪选择了鼓励恐怖
Yusuf Al Ahmadi chose to encourage it.

755
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,720
所以  很不幸
So, unfortunately,

756
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:00,010
我们现在要放弃讲理了
we must now move beyond reason.

757
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,550
我们必须以武力回应
We must respond with force.

758
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,500
因为我们无论如何也不会释放他
Because there is no scenario in which we will release him.

759
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,830
他会继续被美国羁押  直至死亡
He will remain in United States custody until his dying breath.

760
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,110
如果劫持者再次来电  我们不会回答
If the captors call again, we will not answer.

761
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,340
沟通的阶段已过  不论后果如何
The time for conversation is over, no matter the consequences.

762
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,330
不论詹姆斯·米勒最终是否被释放
Regardless of whether James Miller is released or not,

763
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,440
是否获救
rescued or not,

764
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,650
是否被杀
killed or not...

765
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,060
哈里发国都会被彻底摧毁
ICO will be destroyed.

766
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,240
我们开战了
We are at war.

767
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,900
这场战争将比我们此前发动过的
It will be a war more total than anything we have waged thus far

768
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,020
任何一场反恐战争都更彻底
in the fight against extremism.

769
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,290
战士会牺牲
Soldiers will die.

770
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,640
平民会伤亡
Civilians may die.

771
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,790
我们会承受痛苦  我们会遇到磨难
There will be pain. There will be suffering.

772
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,890
我们会面对人性中最可怕的一面
We will be confronted with the most horrific aspects of humanity.

773
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,260
我们会面对人性的丧失
We will confront the inhuman.

774
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,020
乃至邪恶本身
Evil itself.

775
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,930
但我们一定会取得胜利
But we will triumph.

776
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,350
这场战争  我们不会输
It is not a war we will lose.

777
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,980
如果詹姆斯·米勒惨遭不幸
And if the worst happens to James Miller...

778
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,250
我们必须记住
we must remember,

779
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,120
哀悼不是恐惧
to mourn is not to fear,

780
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,550
悲痛不是认输
to grieve is not to admit defeat.

781
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,080
上帝保佑美国
God bless America,

782
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,270
保佑所有热爱自由和民主的人们
and all of those who believe in freedom and democracy.

783
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,440
-有消息吗  -他们刚发了推特
- Any news? -They just posted on Twitter.

784
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,880
九点整  全网直播
9:00 sharp, live on the Internet.

785
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,580
我们来不及找到他们
We won't find them before that.

786
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,890
我们能屏蔽他们的视频吗
Do we have the capability to block the video?

787
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,270
我们能屏蔽几个网站
Well, we might be able to block some sites,

788
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,100
-但如果他们的镜像足够多  -不用屏蔽
- but if they have enough mirrors-- - Don't block anything.

789
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,440
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

790
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,370
让全世界好好看看
The whole world should watch this.

791
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,550
我们也要看
And we should, too.

792
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:03,190
-你说"我们开战了"  -我想建立个联盟
- What you said, "We're at war..." - I want to build a coalition.

793
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,730
-更多空袭吗  -地面进攻  空袭
- More air strikes? - Ground, air...

794
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,590
我要全军出动
The full force of our military.

795
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,250
你应该先讨论一下的
Well, I wish you would have consulted first.

796
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,620
这么大规模的升级行动
This type of escalation--

797
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,850
这不是升级  凯茜  是全面铲除
Not escalation, Cathy. Obliteration.

798
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,930
你是想以此回应那篇报道吗
This is your response to the article?

799
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,720
该做的就得做
We're doing what's necessary.

800
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,680
找到绑匪之后  就地正法
When you find them... you will kill them.

801
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,370
如果能活捉的话  我们也许能问出...
If we're able to apprehend alive, we may get--

802
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,700
我明白了  总统先生
I understand, Mr. President.

803
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,590
先生
Sir?

804
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,210
我想全身心投入  我能做到
I wanna be 100%. I can give you that.

805
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,300
但是会很不容易  因为我...
But it's gonna be a lot harder if I...

806
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,780
如果您需要我留在您身边  我会的
If you want me here by your side, I will be.

807
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:54,740
-但我更想...  -不
- But I'd prefer-- - No.

808
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:59,220
需要做什么就去做  完事了再回来
You do what you have to do. Be back when it's over.

809
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,140
我会的  谢谢  先生
I will. Thank you, sir.

810
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,160
你要不要进屋去
Do you want to come inside?

811
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,320
-孩子们在吗  -在
- The kids there? - Yeah.

812
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,870
-你不打算让他们看...  -不
- You're not letting them watch... - No.

813
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,510
我禁止他们看
No, I forbade them to.

814
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,710
不过他们还得上学  还有朋友
Although, I mean, with school and... and their friends,

815
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,060
如果他们真的想看
it'll be impossible to prevent if...

816
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,490
我也是拦不住的
if they really wanna see it.

817
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,290
他们还好吗
They all right?

818
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,160
你还好吗
Are you all right?

819
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,310
我会好的
I will be.

820
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,580
我必须得好
I have to be.

821
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,810
这一家家的人
All these people in their houses...

822
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,220
马上就要看到可怕的画面
about to see this awful thing...

823
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,230
然后这辈子都忘不掉
that they'll never be able to erase.

824
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,400
你丈夫去世的时候  你在吗
Were you there, when your husband died?

825
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,620
你在房间里吗
In the room?

826
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,010
不在
No.

827
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,270
你曾亲眼看着人死去过吗
Have you ever watched someone die?

828
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,420
我知道你今晚必须得回去
I know you gotta go back there tonight...

829
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,060
但是等你忙完
but when you're done...

830
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,670
不管忙到多晚
whenever that is...

831
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,160
都要来这里
you're staying here.

832
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,850
以哈里发国和尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪的名义
We do this in the name of the Islamic Caliphate,

833
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,940
以真主的名义  我们处决此人
in the name of Yusuf Al Ahmadi, in the name of God.

834
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,610
梅莉沙  我爱你  卡洛琳  我爱你
Melissa, I love you. Caroline, I love you.

835
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,380
上帝啊  请照顾...
Please, dear God, look out--

836
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,220
把声音关上
Turn off the sound.

837
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:16,990
没错
That's right.

838
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,640
我们不向恐怖低头
We don't submit to terror.

839
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,500
我们制造恐怖
We make the terror.

841
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:54,490
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}在是否派遣地面部队打击伊斯兰国的问题上  本届美国政府一直犹豫不决
在2008年的总统大选中  奥巴马一直批评小布什政府滥用武力
他的反战立场  对他力压希拉里获得党内提名有莫大帮助
所以奥巴马就任后  力主从中东战场撤兵
希望尽快结束伊拉克和阿富汗的战事
然而树欲静而风不止  中东动乱不休
伊斯兰国的崛起不仅加剧了地区性冲突
甚至直接威胁到了美国本土的国家安全
2013年阿萨德在叙利亚内战中  多次越过奥巴马禁用化武的"红线"
白宫准备实施空中打击  万事俱备  却在最后时刻偃旗息鼓
一些媒体认为这为后来伊斯兰国的发展壮大提供了机会

843
00:52:54,490 --> 00:53:24,490
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}由于伊拉克和阿富汗战争耗时过久  美国民众普遍厌战
但在伊斯兰国公开处决了美国人质后  美国国内支持动武的呼声渐高
但奥巴马对派遣地面部队仍有保留
2015年12月的加州恐怖袭击案后  美军加大了对伊斯兰国的打击力度
一些特种部队士兵被派往前方执行特殊任务  但仍未大规模派遣地面部队
在正在进行的总统选举中  在国家安全问题上持强硬立场的几位共和党候选人
都在批评奥巴马政府的中东政策
尤其是在打击伊斯兰国上雷声大雨点小  目前的策略没有成效
但几乎所有候选人都不愿意公开支持派遣地面部队对伊斯兰国进行打击
无论2016年总统选举结果如何  奥巴马离开白宫后
新总统面临的最紧要的议题之一  就是如何调整中东战场策略
决定是否要出动地面部队对伊斯兰国进行打击
