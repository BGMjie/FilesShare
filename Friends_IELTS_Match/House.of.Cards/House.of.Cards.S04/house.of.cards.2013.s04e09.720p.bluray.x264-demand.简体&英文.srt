很激动人心吧  可以感受到热烈的气氛
Isn't this exciting? You can feel the electricity.

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,910
好久没举办过开放党代会了
Been a very long time since an open convention.

52
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,440
我很意外您自己一票都没有  参议员
I'm surprised you didn't get a few votes yourself, Senator.

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,270
我没参选副总统
I'm not running for vice president.

54
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,490
克莱尔·安德伍德也没有  她还是得了一票
Neither is Claire Underwood and she got one.

55
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,670
是我投的
That was my vote.

56
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,410
是想增加点趣味吗  先生
Trying to throw some levity into the proceedings, sir?

57
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,890
才不是  我认为她能胜任副总统
Hell, no! I think she'd make a terrific vice president.

58
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,110
安德伍德夫人  安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood! Mrs. Underwood!

59
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,650
我有几个问题  安德伍德夫人  您有时间吗
A couple of questions, Mrs. Underwood, if you have a moment?

60
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,530
可以  我只有几分钟
Yes, I only have time for a few.

61
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,920
欢迎来到亚特兰大  安德伍德夫人
Welcome to Atlanta, Mrs. Underwood.

62
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,690
谢谢
Thank you.

63
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,820
您能对希尔参议员的投票发表评论吗
Can you comment on Senator Sheer's vote?

64
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,830
我很荣幸  但我相信他是开玩笑的
Well, I am flattered. But it's all in good fun, I'm sure.

65
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,040
安德伍德夫人  他说他还会再为您投票
Mrs. Underwood, he says he'll vote for you again.

66
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,370
我鼓励所有人  包括希尔参议员
Well, I am encouraging everyone, including Senator Sheer,

67
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,820
把票投给凯茜·杜兰特
to vote for Cathy Durant.

68
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,810
总统和我
Both the president and I

69
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,420
都认为她是这个职位的最佳人选
think she is the best choice in the field.

70
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,200
你把我们写的稿全改了
You changed everything we wrote.

71
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,060
那个稿子没有创意  也不押韵
There was no imagination to it. No rhythm.

72
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,190
从他们就职就是我们在为他们写讲稿
We've been writing their speeches since they took office.

73
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,650
我们知道自己在做什么
We know what we're doing.

74
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,080
你们在意的是好讲稿  还是撰稿人署名
Well, do you want it to be good, or do you want it to be yours?

75
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,340
最让我激动的投票
The vote I'm most excited about

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,490
是昨天在众议院
is the victory our

77
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,430
我们的《背景普查法案》取得的胜利
Background Check Legislation got in the House yesterday.

78
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,060
所以我希望参议院也能尽快向他们学习
So I'm hoping that the Senate will follow their lead soon,

79
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,620
这样总统就能签署这一法案
and that the president can sign it into law.

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,860
我得走了  非常感谢
I have to go. Thank you so much.

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,810
谢谢您邀请我们
Thank you... for inviting us.

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,860
不
No.

83
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,870
是我应该谢谢你和你儿子
It's me who has to thank you and your son.

84
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,390
他救了我的命
He saved my life.

85
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,250
虽然是因为那样一场悲剧
No matter how tragic the circumstances.

86
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,160
我想带你见见其他接受者
I want you to meet some of the other recipients.

87
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,930
这是詹姆斯
This is James...

88
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,650
他接受了你儿子的一个肾
who received one of your son's kidneys.

89
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,650
这是路易莎
And this is Luisa...

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,420
她接受了你儿子的心脏
who received your son's heart.

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,580
路易莎是名单上的第一个
Luisa was at the top of the list.

92
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,720
她本就剩几小时的生命了
She was hours away from dying.

93
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,280
如果可以的话  我们一起拍个照吧
Uh, if we could, let's all get together for a photo.

94
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,730
詹姆斯  过来
James? Right here.

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,280
-你到这儿来  -好的
- You come right here. - Okay.

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,960
好了
All right.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,060
这边  很好
This way. Great.

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,550
总统对他的移植手术并不避讳
The president isn't shying away from, uh, his transplant.

99
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,740
我认为这是明智之举
Well, I think it's a smart move.

100
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,950
既然不能否认  何必要隐瞒呢
You can't deny it, so why try to hide it?

101
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,780
另外  我认为这也强调了
Plus, I think it underscores the importance

102
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,440
副总统选举的重要性
of the vice presidential situation.

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,230
等等  把捐赠者的妈妈拉出来  感觉像在作秀
Wait, rolling out the donor's mom? That feels a bit exploitative.

104
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,580
我...等等
I... Look, hold on.

105
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,640
有点同情心  那孩子刚刚饮弹自尽了
A little bit of compassion, the kid just shot himself.

106
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,570
而且是用一把手枪
And with a handgun, no less.

107
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,390
合法购买的  不要把重点转移到枪上
Legally purchased. Let's not put this on the gun.

108
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,790
很抱歉  这一切
Look, I am sorry, all of this, the whole thing,

109
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,510
党代会...都是制造戏剧效果
the convention... It's theatrics.

110
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,760
闹起来吧
Hey, look, I... bring on the circus.

111
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,240
比四天的专题广告片有趣多了
It's a lot more fun than some four-day infomercial.

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,870
我们来说说竞选者吧
Let's talk about the contenders themselves.

113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,980
足有十多个
There's almost a dozen of 'em.

114
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,380
-你能小点声吗  -...确实有机会的
- Can you, uh, lower that, please? - ...really have a chance.

115
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,830
杜兰特是头一个
Durant, first among 'em.

116
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,740
这才第一天  上午11点
It's 11:00 in the morning, day one,

117
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,800
收视率比《艾伦秀》还高
and they're beating Ellen.

118
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,880
网站的流量也少了
Less traffic on the website, too.

119
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,180
看视频的人越来越少了
People aren't watching the videos as much.

120
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,930
这个卖了一百多万份
This sold over a million copies.

121
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,520
是网上阅读量的五倍
Five times that many read it online.

122
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,240
对  那是上个月  这是这个月
Yeah, well, that was last month. This is this month.

123
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
我们公开了一位重量级竞选搭档
We announce a stellar running mate.

124
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,690
他在哈里发国问题上重创了安德伍德
He eviscerates Underwood on ICO.

125
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,550
我们手里有两个
We have not one, but two

126
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,610
《名利场》封面供波利跳推送
Vanity Fair covers that Pollyhop's pushing,

127
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,720
而你们却在这里大找借口
and all you give me is excuses.

128
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,080
应该是我们的曝光率压制他们的党代会
The point was for us to drown out their convention,

129
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,180
而不是反过来  我们得把风头夺回来
not the other way around. We need to steal the thunder back.

130
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,890
那就去风口夺风头
So go where the thunder is.

131
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,790
两年来  我一直近在咫尺
I've been one heartbeat away for almost two years.

132
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,990
我对这个已经没兴趣了
My heart's not in it anymore.

133
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,490
过了11月我就回佛蒙特去了
I'm going to head back to Vermont after November.

134
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,560
也许继续教书
Maybe start teaching again.

135
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,960
那你支持谁呢
Who are you supporting, then?

136
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,920
公开说是凯茜·杜兰特
On the record, Cathy Durant.

137
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,630
私下里呢
And off the record?

138
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,340
我不是很喜欢她
I'm not the biggest fan.

139
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,640
为什么
Why?

140
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,920
俄罗斯危机期间她没帮上什么忙
She wasn't much help during the Russia crisis.

141
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,470
可是她和佩特罗夫达成了协议
She closed the deal with Petrov.

142
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,340
功劳的确是归到她头上了
She took credit for it, sure.

143
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,880
但她从始至终都在阻挠那份协议
But she fought the deal every step of the way.

144
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,050
如果不是克莱尔  根本就不可能成
Nothing would've happened if it weren't for Claire.

145
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,190
第一夫人
The First Lady?

146
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,930
是前大使
The former ambassador.

147
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,770
我们在堪萨斯的支持率更接近了  但还不够
We're closer in Kansas, but still not close enough.

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,750
你去争取众议院票时
Did you speak to Jefferies

149
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,660
和杰弗瑞斯谈过了吗
when you were there for the House vote?

150
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,290
他正在向弗雷德·西姆斯施压
He's leaning on Fred Simms.

151
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,550
如果西姆斯可以拉来两三名代表
If Simms could deliver two or three delegates--

152
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,050
那就能拿下整个堪萨斯了
That could push Kansas over the edge.

153
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,060
我可以联系乌麦克
I can call Womack.

154
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,410
他在那边有几个朋友
He's got some friends over the border.

155
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,010
-珀利怎么样  -珀利

156
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,860
沃思堡治安官珀利  是我爸的老朋友了
Sheriff Pawley in Fort Worth, old family friend of my dad's.

157
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,000
他和达拉斯的几位超级代表关系很近
He's close with some superdelegates from Dallas.

158
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,180
可以拉他过来
Yes, he's on board.

159
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,170
真得喜欢那些治安官
Gotta love those sheriffs.

160
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,760
我们在路易斯安那就是那么做的
That's how we do in Louisiana.

161
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,500
恩莱特呢
What about Enright?

162
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,010
我和他约好了在凯悦喝咖啡
I'm meeting him for coffee at the Hyatt.

163
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,980
话说我该过去了  我可不想迟到
In fact, I better get going. I don't wanna be late.

164
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,960
如果我们能拿下弗吉尼亚
Now, if we could lock up Virginia--

165
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,500
就会向全国发出强势的讯息
It would send a very big message.

166
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,430
接下来就是肯塔基
And then Kentucky next.

167
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,140
肯塔基可喜欢你了
He's got a big old crush on you.

168
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,880
那你最好赶紧上路
We better get you on a move.

169
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,530
恩莱特最讨厌不守时了
Enright is a stickler for punctuality.

170
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,500
我挺开心的  我都忘了我多喜欢做党鞭
You know, I'm having fun. I forgot how much I miss being whip.

171
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,930
鞭子你来抽  蜜糖我来喂
You whip 'em. I'll sweet talk 'em.

172
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,010
胡萝卜加大棒最有效了
Nothing like leather and sugar.

173
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,820
先生
Sir?

174
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,980
希尔参议员
Senator Sheer.

175
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,120
参议员  你干得太漂亮了
Senator, you did a fine job.

176
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,800
我最好能拿到黄金时段
Yeah, I better get prime time,

177
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,560
而不是在垃圾时段发表讲话
not one of these midmorning speeches.

178
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,490
周三晚上八点  我亲自和帕特打招呼
Eight o'clock, Wednesday night. I called Patti myself.

179
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,210
你知道政客这个物种
Do you know the main thing that separates

180
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,110
和其他物种最大的区别是什么吗
a politician from the rest of the species?

181
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,840
政客愿意淹死一窝小猫
A politician is the one who would drown a litter of kittens

182
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,290
来换十分钟的黄金时段
for ten minutes of prime time.

183
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,640
杜兰特国务卿  我是政治新闻网的总编
Secretary Durant. Editor in chief, Politico.

184
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,570
没事的
It's all right.

185
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,230
亚当  你亲自来做报道吗
Adam, are you covering this yourself?

186
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,850
68年以来的第一次开放党代会
First open one since '68.

187
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,870
不过这天够潮的
It's humid as hell, though.

188
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,700
我刚来就浑身透湿了
I just got here and I'm already soaked.

189
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,340
不过往好处想
On the plus side,

190
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,110
我听说这里的艳舞俱乐部全国顶尖
I hear they have the best strip clubs in the country.

191
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,810
我能问几个问题吗
Can I ask you a couple questions?

192
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,180
-我有点急事  -就几个
- Well, I'm in a hurry. - Just a couple.

193
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,480
不能公开
Nothing on the record.

194
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,450
和我说说关于
Tell me about the rumors

195
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,260
你在勃兰登堡和佩特罗夫谈判的传闻吧
regarding the deal you struck with Petrov in Brandenburg.

196
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,480
什么传闻
What rumors?

197
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,370
是第一夫人谈妥的协议  而不是你
That it was the First Lady who brokered the deal, not you.

198
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,290
那是团队合作的成果  是谁告诉你的
It was a team effort. Who is your source?

199
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,010
我不能透露  你懂的
I can't. You know that.

200
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,390
实在抱歉  我没有时间了
Well, I'm afraid that's all the time I've got.

201
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,960
行程顺利  亚当
Have a good trip, Adam.

202
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,780
总统今早和凯伦·威廉姆斯一起

在特斯顿侯爵酒店召开了记者会

凯伦的儿子丹尼尔·威廉姆斯

205
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,460
是他所用肝脏的捐献者

一起出席的还有其他器官接受者

威廉姆斯太太和每一位接受者进行了交谈
Ms. Williams took time to speak with each recipient

208
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,840
是她已逝儿子的器官挽救了他们的生命

总统借此肃穆的场合

无论是通过捐赠器官  还是工作

总统在接受器官移植后
The president's condition has improved dramatically

214
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,450

since his organ donation.

他住院期间
The entire country was on edge

216
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,960
全国人民的心都悬在空中
throughout his time in the hospital.

217
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,510
16岁少年丹尼尔
Sixteen-year-old Daniel,

把安德伍德总统从健康危机中解救了出来

他离开了这个世界
left this world by

220
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,130
却回馈了很多他并不知道自己会触动的人
giving back to so many others he never expected to touch.

221
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,030
这样永恒的礼物是不会被遗忘的

在寻求器官移植

最常见的需求是肾脏  肝脏和心脏

虽然这些年来  捐赠者的数量有所上升
And while the number of donors has increased over the years,

227
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,110
接受者在找到一个健康匹配的器官前
recipients are still in for a long, potentially fatal waiting period

228
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,260
仍要熬过一段漫长且可能致命的等待期
before a healthy, matching organ becomes available.

这类移植的等待者

而登上了捐赠名单榜首

但他能及时获得捐赠仍然是很幸运的

很多重症或急需的病人

并不能及时得到救命的移植

我认为我们一致的选票就是你想要的评论
I think our unanimous vote is all the commentary you need.

273
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,870
总统在国情咨文中
Now, the president endorsed your race, uh,

274
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,130
背书了您竞选接替您母亲
your mother's vacant seat, uh, during the State of the Union.

275
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,530
是的  作为领跑者我很骄傲
He sure did, and I'm proud to be the front-runner.

276
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,280
这背书会不会跟您
Did that endorsement have anything to do

277
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,390
对第一夫人的支持有关呢
with your support of the First Lady?

278
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,780
我不否认安德伍德夫妇对我很好
Look, I won't deny that the Underwoods have been good to me.

279
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,620
但不是的  他们叫我投给凯瑟琳·杜兰特
But no. They asked me to vote for Catherine Durant. And

280
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,980
虽然我认为杜兰特国务卿
while I think Secretary Durant

281
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,410
会是这项工作的好人选
would be a wonderful woman for the job,

282
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,920
但我觉得克莱尔是最好的人选

283
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,640
我真的很感激  戴安

289
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,450
我只求你打个电话
All I'm asking is that you make the call.

290
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,370
如果是你说  他会听的
He'll listen if it comes from you.

291
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,710
好生硬
It seems very clunky.

292
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,730
我同意
I agree.

293
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,150
能不能...
Is there a way to...

294
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,780
写出她想要的但写得...
put in what she wants and make it...

295
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,930
-更优雅一点  -他还在为
- more elegant? - He's still pissed about

296
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,470
我担任党鞭时否决的没用国防法案生气
that limp-dick defense bill I killed when I was whip...

297
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,450
也许吧...但我有我的限制
Maybe... but I have my limitations.

298
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,050
我觉得你不太相信她的分析
Well, you don't have much faith in her analytics, I don't think.

299
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,400
都是用数字在说话
It's paint by numbers.

300
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,460
是啊  她还说
Yes, well, she also says

301
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,120
你一直在疏远其他讲稿撰写人
that you've been alienating some of the other speechwriters.

302
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,150
他们的平庸才是他们被疏远的原因
Eh, well, their mediocrity is what's alienating them.

303
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,720
我对那个过敏
I'm allergic to it.

304
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,490
-我独自工作更好  -让我跟布赖斯谈谈
- I work better alone. - Let me speak to Bryce

305
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,990
看看我能做点什么
and then see what I can do.

306
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,710
没错  让韦斯特电子来做
That's right. WestCAM should do it.

307
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,660
最好是今晚
Well, tonight if you can.

308
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,870
实在不行就早上...
The morning is fine if you can't...

309
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,040
我得走了  晚点再讨论讲稿吧
I have to go. Let's discuss the speech later.

310
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,600
对  我只需要你们州再来三票
Yeah, all I need is just three more from your state

311
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,740
我们就赢了
and we've got it.

312
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,210
对  就再多几票
Yes, just a... just a few more.

313
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,350
三票
Like, three.

314
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,150
对  我也是  我们明天再聊
Yes, and so do I. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

315
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,770
晚安
Good night.

316
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,710
汤姆
Tom.

317
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,950
你来之后  我们都没时间
I feel like we haven't even had a chance to say hello

318
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,580
打个招呼
since you came on board.

319
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,750
你是个大忙人
You're a busy man.

320
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,520
我从来没闲下来过
I don't know the opposite.

321
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,290
也有好处  比如睡眠
It has its upsides. Like sleep.

322
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,080
还有朋友
And friends.

323
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,560
那个怎么样了
How's the, uh...

324
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,230
要不是得吃药
You know, if it weren't for the pills,

325
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,470
我一整天都不会想到这事
I could go through entire days without even thinking about it.

326
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,990
不知道那孩子如果知道
I wonder what that kid would think...

327
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,430
他成了总统身体的一部分会怎么想
if he knew that part of him was inside of the president's body.

328
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,680
真悲剧啊
Tragic, huh?

329
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,740
但话又说回来
But, then again,

330
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,760
一个人的悲剧是另一个人的宝藏
one man's tragedy is another man's treasure,

331
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,780
-是不是  -垃圾
- isn't that right? - Trash.

332
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,180
什么
What?

333
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,780
"一个人的垃圾"  应该这么说
"One man's trash." That's how the saying goes.

334
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,410
对了
Oh, right.

335
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,450
讲稿怎么样了
How's the speech coming?

336
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,050
这是你提名演讲的先导讲话  但...
Well, this is for the introduction to your acceptance speech, but...

337
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
不该是她自己的提名演讲吗
shouldn't it be for her own acceptance?

338
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,070
你想让克莱尔赢  而不是杜兰特
You want Claire to win, not Durant.

339
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,730
第一夫人当...
A First Lady as the...

340
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,510
真荒唐
That's ludicrous.

341
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,390
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

342
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,420
而且我觉得你也不
And I don't think you do either.

343
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,860
也许我错了
Maybe I'm wrong.

344
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,290
但如果我说得对
But if I'm right...

345
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,240
她会需要一份终结者性的讲稿
she's gonna need the speech to end all speeches.

346
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,240
提前让我有准备会比较好
And it would be good for me to know that.

347
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,160
我还有其他事
I have some more work to do.

348
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,960
州长  你好吗
Governor! How are you?

349
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,980
对  我也希望我在俄勒冈州
Yeah, well, I wish I was in Oregon, too,

350
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,090
但我现在在亚特兰大
but I'm here in Atlanta

351
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,730
这里比站街女的屄还湿热
where it's muggier than a street hooker's twat.

352
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,390
能和国务卿杜兰特以及
I am honored to be mentioned

353
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,390
贝克参议员相提并论  我倍感荣幸
with Secretary Durant and Senator Baker.

354
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,810
他们都是经验丰富的政治家
They're seasoned politicians.

355
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,300
但我已经有工作了
But I already have a job,

356
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,210
美国的第一夫人
First Lady of the United States.

357
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,570
德州的选票占比超过5%
Well, Texas is over 5% of the vote.

358
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,870
也是我的家乡  所以别想得太多了
And my home state, so let's not make more of it than it is.

359
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,240
克莱尔
Claire!

360
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,250
祝贺你  你现在已经是第五名了
Congratulations. I think you're in fifth place now.

361
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,530
对  而你是当之无愧的第一
Yeah, with you in first, where you should be.

362
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,610
杜兰特国务卿  您认为第一夫人有机会吗
Secretary Durant, do you think the First Lady has a shot?

363
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,650
我觉得德州给了她一次机会
I think Texas just gave her one.

364
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,440
不开玩笑
Kidding aside, do you think

365
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,390
您认为她有外交经验吗
she has the foreign policy experience?

366
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,410
这无关紧要  就像我今早说的
It's beside the point. And like I said this morning,

367
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,270
我鼓励所有人  也包括德州人
I encourage everyone, including Texas,

368
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,100
给杜兰特国务卿投票
to vote for Secretary Durant.

369
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,770
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood--

370
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,670
失陪一下
You know what, if you'll excuse me,

371
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,600
我想继续去打电话
I want to get back to the phones,

372
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,560
确保凯茜得到提名
make sure Cathy gets this nomination.

373
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,080
-谢谢  -能单独说句话吗
- Thank you. - May I have a moment?

374
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,180
当然
Oh, of course.

375
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,780
有没有人问过你勃兰登堡的事
Did anyone ask you about Brandenburg

376
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,390
或者问过你的手下  打探你在其中的角色
or any of your people and your involvement there?

377
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,420
勃兰登堡
Brandenburg?

378
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,960
没有  我们不是都解决了
No, we put that to bed.

379
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,980
我之前也这么以为
That's what I thought,

380
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,250
所以亚当·古尔德告诉我
which is why I was surprised when Adam Gould told me

381
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,350
知情人说功劳全是你的时  我很惊讶
that he had sources saying you deserved all the credit.

382
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,640
我们都统一了说法
We all agreed to what our version of the story is,

383
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,860
这么说有人不听话了
so somebody isn't toeing the line.

384
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,680
肯定不是白宫的工作人员
Well, I'm sure it's not White House staff.

385
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,600
他肯定只是在瞎猜  想挑拨对立
I bet he's just fishing, trying to start some rivalry.

386
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,340
那样就好了  如果他问你或者其他人
Well, I'd be grateful, if he asks you, or anyone else--

387
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,040
当然  而且我一直坚持我们的说法
Of course. And I've been sticking to our story...

388
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,830
是你让俄罗斯人做出让步
which it was you that got the Russians to back down,

389
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,500
我到那儿只是去支持你
and I was just there to support you.

390
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,470
代表们如果知道不会满意的
That wouldn't look good to the delegates,

391
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,660
是你单独和佩特罗夫见了面
the fact that you met with Petrov without me.

392
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,460
会看上去像我根本没控制住...
It would look like I wasn't in command of--

393
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,870
我们讨论的内容不需要让人知道
No one needs to know what we discussed.

394
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,900
你没什么可担心的  凯茜  真的
You have nothing to worry about, Cathy. Honestly.

395
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,320
对  我可以帮你接通
Well, yeah. I can get you on the phone

396
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,590
农业部长的电话
with the Secretary of Agriculture,

397
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,600
但如果你想抗旱救灾
but if you want drought relief,

398
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,090
那只有史蒂文斯和洛佩兹可远远不够
I'm gonna need more than just Stevens and Lopez.

399
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,640
贝克那边有什么安排吗
Has anything been set up with Baker yet?

400
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,100
明早在他的房里
Tomorrow morning, in his room.

401
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,500
这卡得也太紧了
Well, that's cutting it close.

402
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,280
他今晚还要和
He's at a big dinner with

403
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,090
佛罗里达国会代表团吃饭
the Florida congressional delegation tonight.

404
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,200
那好  请务必回电
Well, all right, and call me back.

405
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,920
凯茜已经听见风声了
The rumors have gotten to Cathy.

406
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,690
我们本来就是想把风声传出去
Well, we did want them to spread. That was the idea.

407
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,210
我们得有人找她谈谈
I think one of us needs to speak with her.

408
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,320
但计划是要等到万不得已再去
Yeah, but the plan was to wait till it was inevitable.

409
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,240
如果我们不尽快把她拉进来  弗兰西斯
If we don't involve her sooner than later, Francis,

410
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,500
她可能会背叛我们
she could turn on us.

411
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,550
那好  你去见贝克
All right, you take your meeting with Baker.

412
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,790
-我去和凯茜谈  你去安排  -好  先生
- I'll talk to Cathy. You set that up. - Yes, sir.

413
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,860
你打算说到什么地步
How much are you going to say?

414
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,030
让她有心理准备就行
Just enough to prepare her.

415
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,060
不少人来电问安德伍德夫人和俄罗斯的事
A lot of calls about Mrs. Underwood in Russia.

416
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,840
你否认了
Denying?

417
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,020
我无视了  基本上就是等于默认了
Ignoring, which is the same as confirming.

418
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,830
-很好  -克莱尔在里面吗
- Good. - Claire in there?

419
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,750
她正在和总统私谈
She's speaking privately with the president.

420
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,140
我进去她不会介意的
Oh, I'm sure she won't mind.

421
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,750
查莉安查得怎么样了
Where are we with LeAnn?

422
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
-她没有问题  -不可能
- She's clean. - No.

423
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
我不相信
I refuse to believe that.

424
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,540
道格  如果我们的竞选经理完蛋了
Doug, if our campaign manager bites the dust,

425
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,350
这对我们没有好处
that hurts us.

426
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,340
这是我给你的任务
I gave you a task.

427
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,940
我继续查
And I'll keep at it.

428
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,770
今早捐肝的新闻做得漂亮
Nice coverage on the liver thing this morning.

429
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,840
我给你发了些链接
I emailed you some links.

430
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,740
孩子们都大了  结婚了
Boys are older now, both married.

431
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,810
第三个孙子也要出世了
Got a third grandkid on the way.

432
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,590
如今我们不怎么去湖边了
We don't get out to the lake much these days.

433
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,350
混首都圈代价不小啊
Washington takes its toll.

434
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,590
那是自然
It sure does.

435
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,720
我这些年牺牲了不少  安德伍德夫人
I've made a lot of sacrifices over the years, Mrs. Underwood.

436
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,740
最主要的就是没时间陪孩子
Time with my boys, that's a big one.

437
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,630
我不知道能不能赢  但我参与进来了
Who knows if I'll win, but I'm in the mix.

438
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,220
我不能牺牲这次机会
And I can't sacrifice this opportunity

439
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,320
为凯茜·杜兰特铺路
to pave the way for Cathy Durant.

440
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,420
你赢不了的  参议员  你我都清楚
You won't win, Senator. We both know that.

441
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,930
可我不能帮她
But I can't help her.

442
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,150
我知道你们两个有分歧
Now, I realize you two don't get along.

443
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,050
她看不惯我
She despises me.

444
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,060
老实说  我对她也是一样
And I have to say, the feeling is mutual.

445
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,450
-听着  -她一就任国务卿
- Well, listen-- - The moment she became Secretary of State,

446
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,640
就让共和党人
she got the Republicans to

447
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,010
把我从外事委员会赶出来了
remove me from the Foreign Relations Committee.

448
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,260
弗兰西斯对此很不高兴
And Francis was very upset about that.

449
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,100
可这都是过去的事了
But that was the past.

450
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,650
我们还是放眼未来吧
Let's talk about the future.

451
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,200
党内对克莱尔如此支持  我们都没想到
This support for Claire, it's caught us both off guard.

452
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,590
但我要你来做副总统
But you are my choice for vice president.

453
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,940
这一点不会变
Nothing has changed on that front.

454
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,090
我只是担心那些传言
Well, my only concern are the rumors.

455
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,530
的确会威胁我的胜算
They could damage my chances.

456
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,670
对  我们会想办法应对的
Yes. And we'll do what we can to combat those.

457
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,130
克莱尔也是这么说的  我很感激
That's what Claire said, too, and it's much appreciated.

458
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,010
但是如果  仅仅是如果
But, if, and-- Oh, God, it's a big if.

459
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,350
但是如果
But what if...

460
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,880
对克莱尔的支持成了气候
support for Claire picks up steam...

461
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,220
你不是真以为有这可能吧
Well, you don't actually think that will happen?

462
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,410
当然不了  第一夫人哪能当副总统
Oh, no. I mean, a First Lady as VP?

463
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,210
怎么行
No.

464
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,390
党内想要个有经验的人  人民也是
The party wants someone with experience, and so does the country.

465
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,600
那是当然
Absolutely.

466
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,920
但这次是开放党代会
But... it is an open convention,

467
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,420
所以我们必须
and so we have to operate

468
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,780
准备应对一切可能发生的情况
with the belief that anything could happen.

469
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,110
媒体是对这个想法十分感兴趣
I mean, the press is certainly enjoying imagining it.

470
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,350
那可不  这种头条吸引眼球
Well, sure. It makes for a good story.

471
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,610
而这种新闻我们也没办法控制
Yeah, and it's the kind of coverage that we can't really control.

472
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,690
我是说
You know, I mean,

473
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,960
这种风声会自己落地生根
these things have a way of taking on a life of their own.

474
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,310
就像佐伊·巴恩斯的报道
Like the Zoe Barnes story

475
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,690
影响了我担任国务卿的提名
did about my nomination for Secretary of State.

476
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,120
只不过那是我们设计好的
Except that one we planted.

477
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,270
-这次你没有吗  -当然没有
- And this one you didn't. - No, absolutely not!

478
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,970
克莱尔都不知道怎么回应这些支持票
I mean, Claire was mortified by those votes.

479
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,780
你是说  如果新闻报道影响了足够多的人
What you're saying is if the coverage influences enough people...

480
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,920
我们必须有所准备
Well, we have to be prepared for that.

481
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,880
当然了
I mean...

482
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,710
从政治角度讲  这简直是灾难
of course, politically, it would be a disaster.

483
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,330
也许是  也许不是
Maybe, maybe not.

484
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,300
你觉得不一定吗
You don't think so?

485
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,030
我个人觉得克莱尔会非常称职
Well, personally, I think Claire would do an excellent job.

486
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,060
你这么说我实在是没想到
Well, I am very surprised to hear you say that.

487
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,700
你不相信她会吗
You don't believe she would?

488
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,900
我只是从来没这么想过
Well, I've just never really considered it.

489
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,900
第一夫人  当副总统
The First Lady? As vice president?

490
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,430
有251个党代表支持这个想法
Well, 251 delegates think it's a good idea.

491
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,960
他们大多来自德州  那只是玩笑
Well, most of those were from Texas, which was a lark.

492
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,750
是吗
Was it?

493
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,130
支持我的党代表不比你少  参议员
I have as many delegates as you do, Senator.

494
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,050
-但如果你开始支持我  -你得票翻倍
- But if you start pushing yours my way... - You double.

495
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,860
并且票数最多
And take the lead.

496
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,750
-然后凯茜再支持你获得提名  -就是这样
- And then Cathy puts you over the top. - That's the idea.

497
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,790
她也支持你吗
So she's in on this?

498
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,320
她会的
She will be.

499
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,330
假设克莱尔真的票数领先
Well, let's say Claire does take the lead,

500
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,600
先不管可能性有多大吧
however unlikely that may be...

501
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,690
-我看基本不可能  -先假设她领先了
- Very unlikely, I would say. - Well, let's say she does.

502
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,140
你打算怎么办
What do you propose?

503
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,010
我还真不知道
I honestly don't know.

504
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,480
你肯定得支持她吧
Well, you'd have to support her, wouldn't you?

505
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,490
你总不能抛弃自己的妻子
You can't abandon your own wife.

506
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,850
那倒是  可我也不能抛弃你啊
Uh, true, but I can't abandon you either.

507
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,070
如果她真的领先了
Well, if she took the lead,

508
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,590
我想我也得支持她了
I suppose I'd have to support her, too.

509
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,170
我决不会要求你做那样的事
No, I would never ask you to do that.

510
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,790
你不必要求我  我们是一边的
But you don't have to ask. We're on the same team here.

511
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,100
那我就直接问了
Well, to be perfectly blunt...

512
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,490
我有什么好处
what's in it for me?

513
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,810
你想要什么好处
What would it take?

514
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,140
来推销的是你  你说说吧
You're doing the selling. Make me an offer.

515
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,120
假设克莱尔成功了
Let's say Claire gets it.

516
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,240
如果你赢了的话  我可以留任吧
I assume I stay on, if you get the general.

517
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,070
那肯定
Oh, absolutely.

518
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,280
我可不敢想像
I cannot imagine the next

519
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,880
接下来的四年里没有你来当美国的...
four years without you being my Secretary of...

520
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,980
国务卿
...State.

521
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,350
你要把凯茜的工作给我
You'd give me Cathy's job?

522
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,570
我们是这么打算的
We're prepared to.

523
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,950
-道格  -国务卿女士
- Doug. - Madam Secretary.

524
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,680
出了个问题  先生
We have an issue, sir.

525
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,580
当我最早警告总统哈里发国会不断壮大
When I first warned the president that ICO would grow,

526
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,930
并迅速扩张时  他什么都没做
and grow quickly, he did nothing.

527
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,860
昨天哈里发国的领袖发了这条推特
Yesterday, the leaders of ICO sent out this tweet.

528
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,840
"苏瓦尔已被我们夺下
"As Suwar is ours.

529
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,980
幼发拉底河将被鲜血染红"
Soon heads will roll into the Euphrates."

530
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,060
不仅用阿拉伯文发  还有英语
That wasn't just in Arabic, that was in English,

531
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,860
以及其他16种语言
and sent out in 16 other languages.

532
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,310
他们善于媒体攻势  在全球范围内招募人手
They're media savvy, they're recruiting around the globe.

533
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,510
他们现在资金和人手都很充足
They have the money and the manpower now.

534
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,280
一旦他们进入幼发拉底河流域
Once they get to the Euphrates,

535
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,630
他们将扼住北叙利亚的命门
they'll have a choke hold on northern Syria.

536
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,330
我们必须采取行动  总统先生  马上行动
We must act, Mr. President, and we must act now.

537
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,270
一般来说  党代会有种
Normally, there's a tradition of sportsmanship

538
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,970
传统的竞争精神
when it comes to conventions.

539
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,360
一名候选人保持低调
One candidate lays low

540
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,800
让另一名候选人得到最大关注
so the other gets his or her moment in the spotlight.

541
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,610
但是总统不仅
But not only is the president

542
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,730
在无视一个重大的世界安全威胁
ignoring a great threat to the world's security,

543
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,840
他还侮辱了唯一站出来为我们大声疾呼的人
he's insulted the one man who stood up and spoke out for us all.

544
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,930
这篇详细阐述了
When this profile came out

545
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,630
将军刚刚所说的内容的专访发行后
about everything the general just mentioned,

546
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,350
白宫竟然指责他利用恐怖主义做政治文章
the White House said that he was politicizing terrorism.

547
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,830
而当我宣布布洛哈特将军
And when I announced that General Brockhart

548
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,460
将成为我的竞选搭档后
was going to be my running mate,

549
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,200
总统竞选团队竟称  我原话引用
the president's campaign said, and I quote,

550
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,160
"为将军拿爱国换仕途的行径感到惋惜"
"It's a shame the general traded in patriotism for careerism."

551
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,580
这可实在是称不上竞争精神
Now, I don't call that very sportsmanlike.

552
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,950
这就是下作
I call it disgraceful.

553
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,090
总统为这个国家打过几场仗
How many wars has the president fought for his country?

554
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,770
我们都知道  一次都没有
I think we all know, none.

555
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,690
而他却质疑这位曾多次为国而战的人的爱国心
And he questions the patriotism of a man who has fought in many?

556
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,500
你听好  总统先生
You hear me, Mr. President.

557
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,330
我要求你对哈里发国采取措施
I demand that you do something about ICO.

558
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,030
我要求你对将军道歉
And I demand that you make an apology to the general.

559
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,020
你不做到这两点  我们就不离开亚特兰大
And we're not leaving Atlanta until you've done both.

560
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,590
各大电视台都在直播
Live on every network right now.

561
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,200
他这步棋我服气
I gotta hand it to him.

562
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,490
不知道是不是他自己的主意
I wonder if this was his idea,

563
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,850
因为都有点我的风格了
'cause it's almost something like I would do.

564
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,200
不管他  外面35度呢  让他熬下去吧
We ignore him. It's 95 degrees. Let him sweat it out.

565
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,780
我们越是不理他  他得到的关注就会越高
I think the longer we ignore him, the more attention they'll get.

566
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,210
我同意莉安
I agree with LeAnn.

567
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,220
那就道歉吧
So apologize.

568
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,650
无非是面子而已
It's only pride.

569
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,030
如果您同意  我可以来道歉  先生
I can do it if you want, sir.

570
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,010
是我写的声明
I wrote the statement.

571
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,430
不  只有弗兰西斯亲自出面才管用
No, it only works if it comes from Francis.

572
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,860
克莱尔说得对
Claire's right.

573
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,520
除了道歉  我们还可以做更多
And we can do more than just apologize.

574
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,620
我可以和这混蛋见面
I can meet with the bastard.

575
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,110
州长和将军指出的问题都非常重要
The issues the governor and the general raise are important ones.

576
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,680
这超越两党分歧  甚至超越政治
They transcend party affiliations and, quite frankly, politics.

577
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,460
鉴于此  我在此邀请州长
And so in that spirit, I'm inviting the governor

578
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,690
来这里和我见面
to come here and join me,

579
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,660
这样我们可以举行闭门会谈  因为
so that we can have a conversation privately because...

580
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,520
无论最终谁当选  都要对付哈里发国
whoever becomes the president is going to have to deal with ICO

581
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,560
以及我们在世界各地面临的其他恐怖威胁
and all of the other terrorist threats that we face around the globe.

582
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,400
所以我期待听到
So I'm looking forward to hearing

583
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,480
他们可能有的任何想法和方案
whatever ideas and solutions that they may have...

584
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,380
因为聪明的总统会偷任何人的好主意
because a smart president will steal good ideas from anyone.

585
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,660
我们用仁慈干掉他们吧
Let's kill them with kindness, shall we?

586
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,180
-州长  -总统先生
- Governor. - Mr. President.

587
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,490
请让将军接一下电话好吗
Would you please put the General on the line?

588
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,700
先生
Sir?

589
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,790
将军
General...

590
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,360
你对这个国家的贡献深受看重
your service to this country is greatly valued

591
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,490
你的爱国精神也是不容置疑的
and your patriotism is without doubt.

592
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,970
在激烈的竞选之中  我们过火了
And in the heat of the campaign, well, we went too far.

593
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,500
我们发表了不该发表的声明
We issued statements that we shouldn't have,

594
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,380
为此我要向你道歉
and for that I want to apologize,

595
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,070
希望你能接受
and I do hope that you will accept it.

596
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,320
对我而言  除掉哈里发国
Far more important to me than an apology

597
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,010
远比道歉重要  总统先生
is eliminating ICO, Mr. President.

598
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,580
我非常赞同  将军
I couldn't agree with your more, General.

599
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,630
麻烦你把电话交回给州长
If you'd be so kind as to put the Governor back on the phone.

600
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,020
我收到你的邀请了  总统先生
I received your invitation, Mr. President.

601
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,050
那你会来吗  州长
And will you join us, Governor?

602
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,430
得是为了行动  而不是空谈才行
Only if it leads to real action, not just talk.

603
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,050
我向你保证  州长
I can promise you, Governor,

604
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,180
也向整个美国保证  不会是空谈
and the rest of America that it will not just be talk.

605
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,320
那好  如果真有助于保卫自由的话
Then, yes. If it truly leads to securing our freedom.

606
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,640
非常感谢  我期待与你见面
Thank you very much. I look forward to seeing you.

607
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,670
感谢大家
Thank you all very much.

608
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,060
这边请  州长
Right this way, Governor.

609
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,640
你觉得这样好吗
Do you think this a good idea?

610
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,480
我还有什么选择  他接我的招了
What choice do I have? He called my bluff.

611
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,380
欢迎  州长
Welcome, Governor.

612
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,000
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

613
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,810
我安排了一个房间
I have a room set up for us.

614
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,390
来
Here.

615
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,400
吃些午餐
Have some lunch.

616
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,590
我们有火腿  还有些火鸡
We've got ham, and I think some turkey.

617
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,500
不用了  谢谢
I'm good, but thanks.

618
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,730
真的吗
Really?

619
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,580
看你演的那一出  我以为你喜欢火腿[演过头]呢
After the stunt you just pulled, I would've thought you love ham.

620
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,300
你特意放在这里的
You put this here on purpose.

621
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,330
一点读物
Well, a little reading material, you know.

622
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,120
作为消遣
Something to pass the time.

623
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,940
我刚收到本·格兰特的短信
I just got a text from Ben Grant

624
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,390
说我们来这里后
saying searches for this issue is

625
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,070
对这一期的搜索量爆表
going through the roof since we showed up here.

626
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,810
本·格兰特是波利跳的老板
Ben Grant owns Pollyhop...

627
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,750
没错
That's right.

628
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,960
而他又是你的人
And you own Ben Grant.

629
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,360
这不就是权力吗  你能揽到的人
Isn't that what power is? The people you collect?

630
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,260
你那网络直播真是害惨我了
You really screwed me with that webcast.

631
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,390
我本来把一切都安排好了
I had everything all planned out.

632
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,830
联邦选举委员会  司法部
The Federal Election Commission, the Department of Justice.

633
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,150
我就等着看你灰飞烟灭呢
I was looking forward to watching you go down in flames...

634
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,030
甚至锒铛入狱
maybe even behind bars.

635
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,080
抱歉让你扫兴了
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your fun.

636
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,390
不过挺难堪的  不是吗
It's a bit embarrassing, though, isn't it?

637
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,350
把你们最亲密的镜头公之于众
I mean, sharing all your most intimate moments?

638
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,210
你孩子们的影像
Videos of your children?

639
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,960
我为我的家庭骄傲  怎么会难堪呢
I'm proud of my family. Why would I be embarrassed?

640
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,160
为了赢得所有人的喜爱  要屈尊至此
Well, just that you have to stoop so low to win everyone's love.

641
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,530
看起来挺绝望的  不是吗
It feels a bit desperate, doesn't it?

642
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,560
你在所有民调中都落后15个百分点
You're 15 points behind in every poll.

643
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,090
绝望的人应该是你
So, if anyone's desperate, it should be you.

644
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,200
做总统的关键
Well, the key to being President

645
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,470
不只在于赢得胜利
is not only winning your battles,

646
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,260
而是要赢得有尊严
it's winning them with dignity.

647
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,330
我们谈不谈哈里发国了
Should we talk about ICO?

648
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,890
老天  我们为什么要谈那个呢
Oh, God. Why would we want to do that?

649
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,380
这是我们会面的原因
It's why we're meeting.

650
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,260
对了
Oh, right.

651
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,590
"真正的谈话  真正的行动"
"Real talk, real action."

652
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,770
那就是你关注的  是吗
That's what you're all about, isn't it?

653
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,780
如果你想谈  我们可以谈  不过
Well, I suppose we could if you want to, but...

654
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,130
我们也可以把这一切暂时放下
then again we could just take a break from it all

655
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,840
放松一下
and relax a bit.

656
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,970
老天
God.

657
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,300
这火鸡一股橡胶味
This turkey tastes like rubber.

658
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,210
总比真的吃橡胶[安全套]要好
Well, it's better than eating a real one.

659
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,060
我被民主党人吹箫时
Oh, I always wear protection

660
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,510
总是要做好保护措施
when I'm getting my dick sucked by the Democrats.

661
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,310
你没事吧
You okay?

662
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,600
没事  没事
I'm fine. I'm fine.

663
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,010
我吃东西时别和我开玩笑  我差点噎死
Don't make me laugh when I'm eating. I nearly choked to death.

664
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,180
那倒是让我当上总统的一个办法
Well, that is one way for me to become president.

665
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
-给  -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

666
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,130
-你还好吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Oh, yeah.

667
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,940
你介意我脱掉吗
Do you mind if I take these off?

668
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,370
是崭新的鞋  还没磨合好呢
They're brand new and I'm still breaking 'em in.

669
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,130
你喜欢玩电子游戏  对吧
You like to play video games, right?

670
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,640
你从哪听说的
Now, how did you hear about that?

671
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,350
汤姆·耶茨
Tom Yates.

672
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,130
对了
Oh, yes.

673
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,040
汤姆·耶茨
Tom Yates.

674
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,470
这个人你没能揽到  是不是
That's one person you weren't able to collect, were you?

675
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,720
你是怎么把他招回来的
What did you do to get him back?

676
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,430
他肯定动过心的
Oh, look, I'm sure he was tempted.

677
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,330
毕竟他是个写小说的
He is a fiction writer, after all.

678
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,190
而你是个纽约的共和党人
You're a New York Republican.

679
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,440
这种虚构剧情很诱人啊  是吧
That's an attractive fiction, isn't it?

680
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,650
你是个来自南卡罗莱纳的民主党
And you're a Democrat from South Carolina,

681
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,860
这更像虚构的情节
that's even bigger fiction.

682
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,810
你说对了
Well, there you go.

683
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,060
而且我是个纽约的共和党  基本上就是民主党
And I'm a New York Republican, which is basically a Democrat.

684
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,110
如果你是民主党人  那没有人可以阻挡你
If you were a Democrat, you'd be unstoppable.

685
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,220
你绝对是新一代肯尼迪
You'd be the new JFK.

686
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,040
如果你是共和党  那你会是谁  尼克松吗
And if you were a Republican, who'd you be? Nixon?

687
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,860
尼克松可是个高效得多的总统
Nixon was a far more effective president.

688
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,040
人们崇拜肯尼迪只是因为他被爆头了
The only reason people glorify Kennedy is because he got shot.

689
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,320
你不是也挨了一枪吗
Well, you've got that going for you, too, now, don't you?

690
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,740
而你有你的搜索引擎
And you've got your search engine

691
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,850
和你的家庭视频
and all your little home videos.

692
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,240
如果人们想了解你
See, if people want a piece of you...

693
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,000
你就满足他们  对不对
you give it to them, right?

694
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,090
这就是人们想要的吗
Oh, is that what people want?

695
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,870
了解你
A piece of you?

696
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,950
你玩电子游戏吗
Do you play video games?

697
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,110
不  但我孩子玩
No. My kids do.

698
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,390
我儿子查理特别爱玩一个游戏
There's this one game that my son Charlie, he loves to play.

699
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,080
名字叫"细胞吞噬"
It's called Agar.Io.

700
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,060
我得承认我自己时不时也玩一玩
I have to admit, I might have played it a couple of times myself.

701
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,460
你一开始只是一个小点
You start out as a little dot.

702
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,470
然后你四处移动
And then you go around

703
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,440
吞噬其他的点  你就会变大
eating these other dots and you get bigger.

704
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:24,950
你变得越大
And the bigger you get,

705
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,190
就越得小心别被其他玩家更大的点吃掉
you gotta avoid getting eaten by the bigger players.

706
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,380
与此同时你还要继续吞噬比你小的点
Meanwhile, you're trying to eat the smaller players.

707
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,490
听着挺像总统竞选的
Sounds a little like running for president.

708
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,860
那么现在和你对战的都是真人吗
So, are you playing with real people right now?

709
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,460
没错  来自全世界的玩家
Yeah. From all over the world.

710
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,230
来  你试试
Here, you try it.

711
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,310
-呀  我被吞了  -按这个键
- Oh, I got eaten. - Press that.

712
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,050
我明白了  我又变小了
Ah, oh, I see. It makes you small again.

713
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,130
对  你每次都得重头开始
Yeah, you gotta start over from square one every single time.

714
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,030
我的天  我又被吞了
Oh, God. I got eaten again.

715
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,860
如果其他玩家知道对手是什么人
I wonder what the other players would think

716
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,730
不知道会怎么想
if they knew who they were playing against.

717
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,170
我倒挺喜欢匿名的
Oh, I'm rather enjoying the anonymity.

718
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,540
这真是史无前例
This is unprecedented.

719
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,220
总统和康威州长
The president and Governor Conway

720
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,150
正在大会会场举行闭门会谈
are meeting right now at the convention hall.

721
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,030
两名候选人面对面
Two candidates, face to face.

722
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,480
他们已经进去十分钟了
They've been in there for about ten minutes,

723
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,210
据说在讨论如何应对哈里发国问题
supposedly discussing the ICO situation.

724
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,400
而两名总统候选人继续进行
Now, while the private meeting between the two candidates

725
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,490
闭门会谈的同时
continues behind closed doors,

726
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,720
场内代表们正在
delegates on the floor

727
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,970
准备进行下一轮投票
are gearing up for the next round of voting for...

728
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,880
我们得下去了  下一轮投票马上就要开始了
We should head down. The next ballot is starting soon.

729
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,200
-我马上就去  -在第二轮投票中

四分之一的代表改变了选择

731
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,330
支持第一夫人安德伍德的呼声越来越高
support for First Lady Claire Underwood is picking up steam,

732
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,390
这要部分归功于今天的头条新闻
thanks in part to today's breaking story

733
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,790
称安德伍德夫人在勃兰登堡会谈中立下大功
about Mrs. Underwood's involvement in the Brandenburg negotiations.

734
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,530
参议员斯考特·希尔投下的一张支持票
A single vote from Senator Scott Sheer

735
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,460
扩展到整个德州代表团转而支持第一夫人

736
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,790
你好像  有个电话
You've, uh, got a call.

737
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,010
我最好接下  肯定是大事  他们才会打给我
Yeah, I better take that. They only call if it's important.

738
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,100
我是威尔
Yeah, this is Will.

739
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,520
好  转接过来吧
Yes, put it through.

740
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,610
-失陪  -没事
- Um, excuse me. - Sure.

741
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,790
说吧
Go ahead.

742
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,110
可恶  什么都听不到
Damn! Nothing.

743
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,800
这是战争迷雾
The fog of war.

744
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,020
密室里的密室
A back room within a back room.

745
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,950
不管他在里面搞什么阴谋
Whatever's being plotted in there,

746
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,000
肯定对我不利
I can tell you it's no good for me.

747
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,900
每到这种时候我都巴不得是尼克松
You know, it's at times like these I wish I was Nixon,

748
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,230
严密监听着每一个角落
had every nook and cranny bugged.

749
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,330
-总统先生  -你那个同事
- Mr. President? - Your colleague.

750
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,170
他的定向性有多高
How targeted can he get?

751
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,750
我们实在不该在电话里讨论这些事
We really shouldn't be discussing this over the phone.

752
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,510
他能单独针对一个人吗
Can he isolate a specific person?

753
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,460
技术上讲可以  但是
Technically, yes, but--

754
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,920
一段特定的对话呢
A conversation?

755
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,750
程序中有专门防止这么做的闭锁机制
There are catch mechanisms in the program to prevent that.

756
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,540
他可以进行破解  但会留下痕迹
He can override, but it leaves a trail.

757
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,180
他还在研究如何掩盖痕迹
He's still figuring out how to mask it.

758
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,280
我们纽约来的朋友
Our friend from New York.

759
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,970
我想知道他现在正在说什么
I want to know what he's saying right now.

760
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,180
先生  我表示强烈反对
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

761
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,960
我也建议我们挂电话
I also advise that we hang up.

762
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,340
好吧  我挂了
All right, I'm hanging up.

763
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,770
州长  我们该出去了吧
Governor, should we head out?

764
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,550
马上  总统先生
Just a moment, Mr. President.

765
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,390
目前对于亚特兰大有很大期待...
There's a great deal of anticipation in Atlanta...

766
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,350
谁打来的
Who was that?

767
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,850
总统  他想知道最新的代表投票数
The president. He just wanted the latest delegate count.

768
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,850
...下一轮投票还有几分钟就开始了
...and we're minutes away from the next ballot.

769
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,470
这是昨天上一轮投票的图表
Here's a graphic of the last round yesterday.

770
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,920
国务卿凯瑟琳·杜兰特
Secretary Catherine Durant

771
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,740
以22%的代表票数领先
led the way with 22% of delegates.

772
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,160
道格很不高兴
Doug hates it.

773
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,190
他不高兴什么
He hates what?

774
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,660
你可以直接接触总统
That you have direct access to the president

775
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,030
不用通过他
without going through him.

776
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,210
他希望你走人
He wants you gone.

777
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,690
道格这么跟你说的
Doug told you that?

778
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,050
他要我找你的把柄
He wants me to dig something up on you.

779
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,040
我还没找到
I haven't found anything yet.

780
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,570
你不会找到的  因为我没有把柄
And you won't, because there isn't anything.

781
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,710
我知道  否则我现在已经找到了
I know. Otherwise, I would've found it by now.

782
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,560
你为什么要跟我说这个
Why are you telling me this?

783
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,540
因为如果不是你走  我做不到  我就得走
Because either you're gone or I am, if I don't deliver.

784
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,970
除非你给我点什么
Unless you give me something.

785
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,220
第一夫人克莱尔·安德伍德
...First Lady Claire Underwood,

786
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,520
惊人地出现在第五位

787
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,100
可以是个小把柄  没什么大危害的
It can be small. Nothing too damaging.

788
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,650
只要让我有东西给他看
Just so I have something to show him.

789
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,710
在我报道总统选举的三十年职业生涯中
In my 30 years of covering presidential politics,

790
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,580
从未见过这样的事
I've never seen anything like it.

791
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,220
不好意思
Sorry about that.

792
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,800
没关系
That's all right.

793
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,900
我们出去吧  下轮投票马上要开始了

你想一起看吗
You want to watch it together?

795
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,580
我们在这里待得越久  看起来越好
It might look better, the longer we're in here.

796
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,040
就像我们为美国的未来搏斗了一番似的
Like we grappled with the future of America.

797
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,450
除非你想出去跟群众在一起
Unless you'd rather be out there with the masses.

798
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,650
天呐  群众们
Oh, Christ. The masses.

799
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,360
-我也是这么觉得  -我们现在开始

秘书长女士

路易斯安那州  你想说的是副总统吧
Louisiana, I assume you mean vice president.

841
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,840
我说的就是总统

842
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,120
秘书长女士  路易斯安那州
Madam Secretary, the state of Louisiana

正如大会昨天上午达成的共识
As the convention agreed to yesterday morning,

848
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,760
我们会先选出副总统候选人
we are taking vice presidential nominations first,

849
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:14,100
以在整个大会上进行那一程序
in order for that process to take place over the full convention.

850
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,170
我们只有一位总统候选人
We have one candidate for president.

851
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,060
任何关于该项投票的讨论
Any further discussion on that balloting

00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,810
将放在副总统提名程序

如果你不把票投出去的话  视为弃权

秘书长女士  我们路易斯安那州
Madam Secretary, we, Louisiana,

856
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,970
把副总统提名的61票
cast our 61 votes for vice president,

857
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,690
还是投给凯瑟琳·杜兰特
also for Catherine Durant.

858
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,170
路易斯安那州
Louisiana.

859
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,650
我在他手下干  是他的内阁成员
I work for the man. I'm on his cabinet.

860
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,440
如果总统提名公开竞选  你会同他竞争吗
Would you run against him if his nomination were in play?

861
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,070
我的目标是和总统一起参选  而非互相竞争
My goal is to run with the president, not against him.

862
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,370
听着  我爱我的家乡  路易斯安那
Look, I love my home state of Louisiana,

863
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,790
-但他们太热情  -她会胜任的
- but they're a live bunch... - She'd do a good job.

864
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,660
不过她做国务卿会更出色
She's a much better Secretary of State, though.

865
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,380
我相信事情最终会得到解决的
I'm confident this will all work itself out.

866
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,880
我考虑过你败选之后保留她的位置
I've considered keeping her on after you lose.

867
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,780
你有没有就他们的倒戈与安德伍德总统沟通过
Have you spoken to President Underwood about their defection?

868
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,060
还没有  但我想我很快就会与他谈话的
Not yet, but I'll be speaking with him shortly, I imagine.

869
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,310
不过大会的意义...
Hey, this is part of what a...

870
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,840
-你那通电话  -就在于此
- Your call.  - ...convention is all about.

871
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,770
我也想能居功  但是她找的我
I wish I could take credit, but... but she called me.

872
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,540
不过说回来  当机会到来的时候
Then again, when opportunity strikes...

873
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,680
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

874
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,300
这绝对不算赢得有尊严
Definitely not the way to win with dignity.

875
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,650
杜兰特就她的家乡路易斯安那发表评论
...Durant commenting on her home state of Louisiana.

876
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,960
如果你能赢的话
If you win at all.

877
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,110
我们该出去了
We should get back out there.

878
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,350
你还得争取提名呢
You've got a nomination to fight for.

879
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,000
总统和我的谈话非常顺利
The president and I, we had a great talk.

880
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,360
我们甚至还一起观看了投票
We, uh, even watched the vote together.

881
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,790
但是我想你们肯定更想听他怎么说
But I'm sure you'd rather hear from him on that than me.

882
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,300
谢谢  州长
Well, thank you, Governor.

883
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,470
今天还真是充满意外  不是吗
Today has certainly been full of surprises, hasn't it?

884
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,250
但是话说回来
But, then again,

885
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,160
毕竟休伊·朗就来自路易斯安那州
Louisiana is the state that gave us Huey Long after all.

886
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:58,160
{\an3}该州前州长
政绩出色  竞选总统时遇刺

887
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,740
虽然我很想讨论这个话题
As much as I would like to discuss this,

888
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,060
但是我必须着手开始处理
I have to get on with the business

889
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,950
州长和我刚刚探讨的那些问题
that the governor and I have just discussed,

890
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,870
因为当总统比竞选总统重要得多
because the business of the presidency trumps running for it.

891
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,580
-谢谢  州长  -谢谢  总统先生
- Thank you, Governor.  - Thank you, Mr. President.

892
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,830
非常感谢各位
Thank you all very much.

893
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,700
我很愿意回答
I'm happy to answer...

894
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,270
马上把凯茜叫到我房间
I want Cathy in my room, now.

895
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,010
我已经给她打过电话了  她拒绝会面
I already called her. She refuses to meet.

896
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,460
-她什么  -她就是这么说的
- She what?  - That's what she said,

897
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,730
然后她就把电话挂了
and then she hung up.

898
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,590
她的手下也不回我电话
Her staff won't return my calls either.

899
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,120
这事想办成  你必须回华盛顿去
For this to work, you have to go back to Washington.

900
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,890
我不能抛下你一个人处理这件事
I can't leave while you're dealing with this.

901
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,510
如果你留下的话  大家会觉得你在从中渔利
If you stay, it will look like you're taking advantage

902
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,590
并且真的在参选
and campaigning for it.

903
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,760
而这件事的关键就在于让人觉得你没这意思
And the key is to make it look like you're not.

904
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,260
我会找凯茜谈的
I'll speak with Cathy.

905
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,680
不用  我已经在处理了
No, look, I've got that covered.

906
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,290
问题是我们怎么解释你的离开
Question is, how we justify your going.

907
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,670
不去华盛顿
It's not Washington.

908
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,740
应该去德州
It should be Texas.

909
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,350
-你母亲  -上次就好使
- Your mother.  - It worked before.

910
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,020
我明天一早就走
I'll leave first thing in the morning.

911
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,690
带上汤姆一起
Take Tom with you.

912
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,840
-汤姆  -他已经知道了
- Tom?  - Oh, he already knows.

913
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,260
-你告诉他了吗  -他自己猜出来了
- Did you tell him?  - He put it together.

914
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,590
他说  如果你能赢下来的话
He said, if you win this thing...

915
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,390
你必须做一次空前绝后的讲话  他说得对
you have to give the speech of a lifetime, and he's right.

916
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,100
不管你在大会堂里说什么
Whatever you say in that convention hall

917
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,110
都会给我们把你推向全国
will lay the groundwork for how we sell this

918
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,830
打下基础
to the rest of the country.

919
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,070
而这就是我们叫他回来的原因  对吧
And that is why we brought him back, right?

920
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,130
你能坐着就睡着吗
You can sleep like that? Sitting up?

921
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,230
我在哪都能睡着
I can sleep anywhere.

922
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,290
真挺有福的
I'm lucky like that.

923
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,240
我们有活儿要干
We have work to do.

924
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,930
好吧  那就干活儿
All right, let's work.

925
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,620
这段得改
This could be better.

926
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,530
对着我大声读出来
Read it for me. Out loud.

927
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,090
我在婚姻中做我丈夫的搭档已有29年
I've been my husband's partner in marriage for 29 years.

928
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:22,990
不行
No.

929
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,950
慢点
Slower.

930
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,220
就像你在大会上讲话那样
Like you're going to say it at the convention.

931
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,330
我在婚姻中做我丈夫的搭档已有29年
I've been my husband's partner in marriage for 29 years.

932
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,870
现在  到了我
Now, it's time for me to be..."

933
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,610
这样我能看到你的脸
So I can see your face.

934
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,560
我在婚姻中做我丈夫的搭档已有29年
I've been my husband's partner in marriage for 29 years.

935
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,770
现在到了我在接下来的4年中
Now, it's time for me to be his

936
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,550
进入白宫  继续做他的搭档的时候了
partner in the White House for the next four.

937
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,570
你说得对
You're right.

938
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,050
是得改
We can do better.

940
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:25,830
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国现有的总统选举  尤其是党内初选制度
是经过漫长的演化才最终形成的
初选选举  选民所选出的并不是总统候选人
而是代表本州参加党代会的代表
所以初选结果计算的并不是候选人获得的选民票数
而是其赢得的州代表数  也就是"选举人票"
这些代表在参加党代会时  再投票决定本党的提名人

942
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:45,830
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}19世纪时  各州党内初选结果只是作为一种民意的评测
直到20世纪初  一些州才陆续规定将选举结果同最终的提名挂钩
20世纪60年代之前  民主党  共和党两党挑选提名人时
很大程度上依赖于党代会召开期间
党内大佬和候选人之间的私下谈判和政治交易
1968年  民主党候选人亨福瑞虽然没有赢得任何一个州的初选
但仍靠党代会上的交易成为了民主党提名人
68年后  民主党决定改革初选制度
使各州的初选结果成为决定提名人的主要途径
共和党随后也对党内初选制度做出了相应的改革

944
00:43:45,830 --> 00:44:00,830
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}无论改革前还是改革后
两党都要求总统候选人必须获得至少过半的选举人票
若多名候选人参选  而没有任何一个获得过半的选举人票
党代会便成为了"开放党代会"
各州代表需要在党代会上进行一轮轮投票
直到某个候选人得到多数票为止
1924年的民主党党代会上
选民代表经过102轮投票才选出最终的提名人
上一次出现需要代表在党代会上
反复投票决定提名人的情况是1952年

946
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:10,830
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}正在紧张进行的2016年大选中  共和党阵营群雄争霸
目前虽然地产大亨特朗普在选票上领先
但其他几名候选人仍然十分具有竞争力
而且由于特朗普言行颇受争议
许多共和党内部人士认为  如果不能在选票上打败特朗普
就要寄望于"开放党代会"  通过州代表投票把特朗普选下来
