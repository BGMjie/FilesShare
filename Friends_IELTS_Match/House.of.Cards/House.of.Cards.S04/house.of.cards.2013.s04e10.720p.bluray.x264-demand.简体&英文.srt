Welcome back. It's a dramatic day.

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,270
我们看下现在情况
Let's see where things stand.

57
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,630
沃尔夫  可以看到形式大变
And, Wolf, you can see the big change.

58
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,110
凯瑟琳·杜兰特现在上了我们的总统提名墙
Catherine Durant now on our presidential nominating wall.

59
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,480
原本有望成为副总统的她
She has shifted from vice presidential hopeful

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,070
转而竞争总统候选人
to potential presidential candidate.

61
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,760
杜兰特成为候选人或许对那些对安德伍德
And a Durant candidacy might be appealing to Democrats

62
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,340
和邓巴都没兴趣的民主党人很有吸引力
who aren't enthusiastic about either Underwood or Dunbar.

63
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,360
设想一下
And imagine this scenario

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,070
纵观整个大会的大局
if we play this out through this convention.

65
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,520
希瑟·邓巴退出初选时支持率是46%
Heather Dunbar came out of the primaries, of course, with 46%.

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
这还不足以赢得提名
It's not enough to win the nomination,

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,020
但如果安德伍德总统要取胜
but for him to win, President Underwood,

68
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,570
他还需要这些超级代表
he still needs these superdelegates.

69
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,740
邓巴退出时他赢得了选民票
He won the popular vote when Dunbar withdrew,

70
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,950
但你的意思是他还没有取得绝对多数
but you're saying he doesn't have a technical majority.

71
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,210
659名超级代表尚未投票
659 superdelegates yet to weigh in,

72
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,620
所以弗兰克·安德伍德已经掉到了48%
so you see Frank Underwood drops down to 48%.

73
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,290
他依然领先  但还不足以获得提名
He's still in the lead, but not enough to clinch the nomination.

74
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,080
想听更复杂的吗  好像还不够复杂似的
And you want a little bit more intrigue, like we need that?

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,800
24个州  沃尔夫  标亮的这24个州
Twenty-four states, Wolf, these 24 states highlighted,

76
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,980
没有所谓的不忠代表法
they do not have so-called faithless delegate laws,

77
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,400
也就是说这24个州的代表没必要
meaning in these 24 states, the delegates don't have to,

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,600
法律上没有规定他们必须投票给
they are not legally bound to vote for the candidate

79
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
赢得本州初选或党团会议的候选人
who won their state's primary or caucus.

80
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,870
他们可以随心所欲投给任何人
They can vote for whoever they want.

81
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,010
他们可以投给希瑟·邓巴
They could vote for Heather Dunbar.

82
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,740
他们可以转投给凯瑟琳·杜兰特
They could switch over and vote for Catherine Durant.

83
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,580
沃尔夫  如果他们想的话  还可以投给你
Wolf, if they want, they could vote for you.

84
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,600
他们不会投给我的
So... They're not gonna vote for me.

85
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,090
但如果杜兰特国务卿吸走了足够的选票
But if Secretary Durant siphons off enough votes

86
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,030
或是安德伍德未能在初轮投票中获得多数
or Underwood doesn't get that majority in the first ballot,

87
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,310
那就一切皆有可能了吗
what, all bets are off?

88
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,260
我觉得今天唯一可以肯定的是
I think about the only sure bet today is

89
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,240
安德伍德总统一定恨不得
President Underwood must be wishing

90
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,870
当初没有同意召开开放党代会
he hadn't agreed to this open convention.

91
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,270
杜兰特或是邓巴真的有可能取胜吗
Does Durant or Dunbar really have a shot at winning this thing?

92
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,460
当然  现任总统本就不是获选上台的
Sure. You've got a president who wasn't elected to begin with.

93
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,630
他的健康状况现在也是一个大问号
His health is a giant question mark right now.

94
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,230
他这个任期非常艰难  再加上开放党代会
He's had a rocky tenure, plus you've got an open convention.

95
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,470
一切皆有可能
Anything could happen.

96
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,590
比如杜兰特成为劲敌
Like giving, uh, Durant a run for her money.

97
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,730
顺便提一下  头条网
Uh, Slugline, by the way,

98
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,940
转载了昨天政治新闻网的报道
picked up the Politico story from yesterday.

99
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,080
在选举现场可能会引起一定注意
It could get traction out there on the floor.

100
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,820
没错  而且在开放党代会上
That's true, and, again, at an open convention,

101
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,630
克莱尔·安德伍德也许会突然成为黑马
Claire Underwood may suddenly be the dark horse here.

102
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,550
母亲
Mother.

103
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,760
你好啊  克莱尔
Hello, Claire.

104
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,300

Why'd you move down here?

105

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,380

Who's that?

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,700
汤姆  能让我们单独聊聊吗
Uh, Tom, would you give us a minute, please?

109
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,670

110
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,180
不不  过来  小伙子
No, no. Come here, young man.

111
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,070

Hi, Mrs. Hale.

112
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,040
我叫汤姆
My name's Tom.

113
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,280
托马斯·耶茨  小说家  你应该听说过他
It's Thomas Yates, the novelist. You've probably heard of him.

114
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,770
我觉得从约翰·契弗起就没什么值得读的书了
I think everything since John Cheever isn't worth readin'.

115
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,460
您也许是对的
You're probably right.

116
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,450
克莱尔
Well, Claire...

117
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,200
你是来清点
did you come to take stock of

118
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,920
我死后你要继承的遗产吗
everything you're gonna inherit when I die?

119
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,930
很方便  不是吗
Well, it's convenient, isn't it,

120
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,320
有个濒死的母亲  可以拿来做出城的理由
having a dying mother when you need an excuse to skip town?

121
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,300
我们不会打扰你的
We won't disturb you.

122
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,110
认识您很高兴  黑尔太太
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Hale.

123
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,920
-叫我伊丽莎白  -好  那您也叫我汤姆
- Elizabeth. - All right. Well, then you call me Tom.

124
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,360
我讨厌人叫我托马斯
I hate "Thomas."

125
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,310
-好  汤姆  -就这么说定了
- Fair enough, Tom. - We have a deal.

126
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,260
我们需要党内团结  而不是四分五裂
We want a unified party, not a fractured one.

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,330
我不能在规则上反复无常
I can't play fast and loose with the rules.

128
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,880
这是开放党代会  本就没有规则
This is an open convention. There are no rules.

129
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,360
我已经按你的意思把黄金时段给了希尔议员
I already gave Senator Sheer that prime-time spot that you wanted.

130
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,340
但这事  作为党代会主席
But this, as chair of the convention--

131
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,200
是我让你做党代会主席的
And I made you chair of this convention

132
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,970
就是想防备这种事
precisely for moments like this.

133
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,400
我有义务不徇私
I have an obligation to not play favorites.

134
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,630
你对党的义务
Your obligation to the party

135
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,500
就是对党领袖的义务
is an obligation to the leader of the party,

136
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,690
身为总统  我就是党领袖
and as the president, that would be me.

137
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,780
-没错吧  -是的  先生  但是
- Correct? - Yes, sir, but--

138
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,160
那这就无关徇私  而是党内团结
Then this isn't about favoritism. It's about solidarity.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
我们已为您安排好车
We've got a car waiting to take you

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,060

141
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,040

I call this convention to order

142
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,630
以及党代会主席  帕特·惠特克之命
of the Democratic National Committee

143
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,650
宣布会议开始
and the convention chair, Patti Whittaker.

144
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,570

Good morning.

145
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,770
我刚得知  总统要去华盛顿
I was just informed that the president will travel to Washington

146
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,450
会见国家安全小组
to meet with his national security team.

147
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,030
鉴于两项提名的主要竞争者
Given that key contenders for both slots on the ticket

148
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,790
今天都不能到场
aren't able to be on the floor today,

149
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,590
规则委员会建议
the Rules Committee has advised that

150
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,530
我们等他们回来
we should wait for their return

151
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,900
再进行下一轮投票
before any further votes are held.

152
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,270
现有一项动议  延期所有投票
There is a motion to postpone all votes

153
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,390
直到总统回来
until the president's return.

154
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,070
哈里发国已于昨晚深夜从苏瓦尔出发
ICO began its advance from As Suwar late last night,

155
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,210
据我们的计算和他们目前的行军速度来看
and by our calculations and their current pace,

156
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,370
我们预计他们会在72小时内到达幼发拉底河
we expect them to reach the Euphrates within 72 hours.

157
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,090
这可能影响公路和河道交通
Now, this could disrupt highway and river traffic,

158
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
但更重要的是
but more importantly,

159
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,830
这会使他们有机会
could give them the opportunity

160
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,370
破坏该地区的重要水坝
to destroy vital dams in the region.

161
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,760
因此  我现在就前往华盛顿
And as a result, I am heading to Washington right now

162
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,760
来讨论怎样阻止这次哈里发国的进军
so that we can decide exactly how we should stop this ICO advance.

163
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,690
这突然的计划变动
Is this sudden change of plans

164
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,410
是您昨天与康威州长会晤的结果吗
a result of your meeting with Governor Conway yesterday?

165
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,190
如果州长的言论促使哈里发国加速计划
Well, it wouldn't surprise me if ICO accelerated their plans,

166
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,040
我也不会惊奇
uh, because of the governor's comments.

167
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,740
他们懂得如何利用媒体的关注
They certainly know how to take advantage of media attention.

168
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,790
但无论事实是否如此
But whether that's the truth or not,

169
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,140
解决这个威胁迫在眉睫
this is an imminent threat which we must deal with immediately.

170
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,540
我很高兴总统听取我的意见
I'm glad the president heard me

171
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,230
并终于采纳了布洛哈特将军的建议
and finally took General Brockhart's advice to heart.

172
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,420
现在我们只能
Now we'll just have to

173
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,500
等着看看是否真能得到什么结果
wait and see if it actually results in anything.

174
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,590
只希望不会收效太小  太迟
I just hope it's not too little, too late.

175
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,640
州长先生  您现在如何打算  留在亚特兰大吗
What are your plans now, Governor? Remain in Atlanta?

176
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
不  我和汉娜要回到竞选活动中
No, Hannah and I are heading back on the trail.

177
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,130
我们在佐治亚州完成了我们要做的事
We accomplished what we needed to here in Georgia, and

178
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,840
我们今天要去亚利桑那州  然后去犹他州
we're heading off to Arizona today and then Utah.

179
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,470
总统先生  总统先生
Mr. President. Mr. President.

180
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,940
为什么去华盛顿  而不是在这里解决
Why Washington and not here?

181
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,880
这个问题太敏感  不能在外解决
This issue is too sensitive for a mobile White House.

182
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,470
我需要在战况室里
I need to be in the Situation Room

183
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,920
与行政人员和顾问团队一起讨论
with my entire staff and team of advisors around me.

184
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,860
总统先生  总统先生
Mr. President. Mr. President.

185
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,860
亚当
Yes, Adam.

186
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,990
总统先生  这是为了堵国务卿杜兰特的嘴吗
Mr. President, is this a way to silence Secretary Durant

187
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,680
因为路易斯安那州将她推入了总统竞选
after Louisiana put her in the running for president?

188
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,020
我不会把国家安全与政治竞争混为一谈
I don't use national security matters for political purposes.

189
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,180
你知道的  亚当
You know that, Adam.

190
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,590
如果你们还有其它问题  请向赛斯提问
You have any other further questions, please direct them to Seth.

191
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,970
非常感谢各位
Thank you all very much.

192
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,950
-要我一起去吗  -不  你留下
- You want me to come with? - No, you stay behind.

193
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,730
-掌控好局面  -是  先生
- Keep everything under control. - Yes, sir.

194
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,770
有消息称她已经离开亚特兰大了
There are reports that she's left Atlanta.

195
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,310
第一夫人是今早早些时候离开的
The First Lady left earlier this morning.

196
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,390
她母亲的健康状况在过去几天进一步恶化了
Her mother's health has deteriorated in the past few days.

197
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,760
亚当
Adam.

198
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,050
这是否意味着她会退出副总统的竞选
Does this mean she's out of the running for VP?

199
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,140
第一夫人从来就没参选过
The First Lady was never in the running.

200
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,750
她和总统会继续支持凯瑟琳·杜兰特
She and the president continue to support Catherine Durant--

201
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,990
四个孩子的父亲  水手
Father of four, sailor...

202
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,340
因为踩到了生锈的鱼钩导致葡萄球菌感染
staph infection from stepping on a rusty fish hook.

203
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,970
天呐
Heavens!

204
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,050
还有这个  嗯  你曾是只果蝇
And this one, yeah, you were a fruit fly.

205
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,230
-果蝇  -对
- A fruit fly. - Yes.

206
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,350
你曾是拉斯普京的伴侣  享用他14英寸的
You were a consort to Rasputin and his 14-inch...

207
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,350
{\an3}俄帝国时期神棍
因为尺寸大而闻名
实为11英寸

208
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,290
不要  别说出来
No, don't say it.

209
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,420
我不用说  你已经在脑补了
I don't have to say it because you're already imagining it.

210
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,200
我看完了
I looked it over.

211
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,060
咱们出去谈
I'll meet you outside.

212
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,810
打算留给薇和那些姑娘们的
Uh, gonna leave all this to Vi and the girls

213
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,340
如果你不想要的话
if you're not interested.

214
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,290
外婆的首饰
Grandmother's jewelry?

215
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,830
要是我不至少跟你提一嘴
She'd turn over in her grave

216
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,640
她在墓里都得气得翻身
if I didn't at least offer it to you.

217
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,320
她品味真不错
She had great taste.

218
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,640
不然你以为我的品味从哪来的
Where do you think I got it from?

219
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,720
这是什么
What's this?

220
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,210
打开看看吧
Look at it. Open it up.

221
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,190
肯定还是值点钱的  第一夫人的乳牙
Must be worth somethin', baby teeth of the First Lady.

222
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,910
我挺喜欢那个小伙儿
I like that boy.

223
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,510
能逗我笑
Makes me laugh.

224
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,030
就像你父亲在世时那样
Like your father used to.

225
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,860
我想象不出爸爸扮成算命的是什么样
Can't imagine daddy dressed up as a fortune teller.

226
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,410
你会意想不到的  他也有逗逼的一面
Oh, you'd be surprised. He had a silly side to him.

227
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,400
我是没见过
Not that I ever saw.

228
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,780
有些事他只会在我面前做
Well, there were certain things that he only did with me.

229
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,720
你瞧  笑一笑能缓解疼痛
Oh, you see, laughter is good for the pain.

230
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,410
比吗啡还有效
Even better than this morphine.

231
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,880
-我来帮你吧  -不用  我自己能行
- Let me help you. - No, no, I can do it.

232
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,250
你走吧
You just go.

233
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,330
走
Go!

234
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,250
你把所有内容都划掉了
You crossed everything out.

235
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,060
-因为不够好  -我知道
- It wasn't good. - I know.

236
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,540
等她去世了  你打算对这里也那样吗
Is that what you're gonna do here, after she dies?

237
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,730
因为不够好  把一切都抹去
Cross everything out... because it wasn't good?

238
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,220
我不会和你谈论我母亲的
You're not going to get me to talk about my mother.

239
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,270
我希望不会
I hope not.

240
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,500
恨太丑恶了
Hatred's ugly.

241
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,990
天气这么好  不适合谈那个
It's too beautiful a day for that.

242
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,520
回去干活儿喽
Back to the salt mines.

243
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,700
请坐
Please, sit.

244
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,570
先生  这是哈里发国目前的位置
Sir, these are the current ICO positions.

245
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,350
我们还在起草任务项目
We're still drafting action items,

246
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,650
但是我们可给您一个大致的
but we can give you a rough sense--

247
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,130
在讨论军事选择之前
Well, before we discuss any military options,

248
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,240
我要和大马士革通话  看看他们能允许什么行动
I'd like to put a call in to Damascus and see what they'll allow.

249
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,070
国务卿女士  跟我一起来吧
Madam Secretary, won't you join me?

250
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,140
为了单独见我  你不惜召集
So you had to call a national security meeting

251
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,680
国家安全会议
just to get us in the same room?

252
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,030
也为了不让你和康威通话
And to keep you off the phone with Conway.

253
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,950
我只需要给他打一通电话  不需要第二通
All I needed was one call to him. I don't need to make another.

254
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,180
你不是真觉得他会任命你为国务卿吧
You don't actually think he's gonna make you Secretary of State, do you?

255
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,430
估计不会  但我真想看到
Probably not, but I would've paid good money

256
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,940
他告诉你消息时你的脸色
just to see your face when he told you.

257
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,740
我从没保证会和你一起参选
I never promised you the ticket.

258
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,290
我只说了会尽力
I promised you I'd try.

259
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,260
你是装作尽力
You pretended to try.

260
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,330
对克莱尔的支持不会凭空出现
Claire's support didn't just happen on its own,

261
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,020
你还好意思握着我的手
and you had the gall to take my hand,

262
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,950
看着我的眼睛  对我撒谎
look me in the eye and lie to my face.

263
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,850
-你错了  凯茜  -拜托  弗兰克
- You're mistaken, Cathy. - Oh, come on, Frank.

264
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,850
从沃克就职的那天起
I've had a front row seat to everything

265
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,030
我就近距离看到了一切
since the day Walker took office,

266
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,340
所有的谎言和背叛  我还帮了你
all the lies and betrayals, and I helped you.

267
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,160
我的错误是以为你不会在背后捅我一刀
My mistake was I assumed you wouldn't stab me in the back.

268
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,650
你的错误是弄巧成拙
Your mistake is that it backfired.

269
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,810
这完全是个人恩怨  对吧
This is all personal, isn't it?

270
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,110
完全是为了报复我在医院时  克莱尔那样对你
This is about how Claire treated you when I was in the hospital.

271
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,690
别这么小瞧我  这是生意
Give me more credit than that. This is business.

272
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,110
我们曾是合作伙伴  是你违约了
We were partners. You broke the contract.

273
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,930
-那你想要什么  -还有什么呢  弗兰克
- So, what do you want? - What else is there, Frank?

274
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,890
什么都没了
Nothing.

275
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,960
很简单  要么让克莱尔的票改投给我
It's simple. Either Claire's votes come my way...

276
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,840
要么我就把大会搞得一团乱
or I turn the convention upside down.

277
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,970
我们得谈谈赛斯
We need to talk about Seth.

278
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,270
我接到了许多前客户的电话
I've been getting calls from former clients.

279
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,370
你开口之前  我告诉你我干过的坏事吧
Now, before you say anything, here's the dirt.

280
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,830
我8年级时在一次数学测验上做过弊
I cheated on a math test in 8th grade,

281
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,720
我16岁时曾为返校节偷过一条裙子
I shoplifted a homecoming dress when I was 16,

282
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,140
我大一时跟一个女生联谊会的姐妹搞过
I experimented with a sorority sister in freshman year,

283
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,380
我2007年晚交了税
and I was late on my taxes in 2007.

284
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,850
但他不会找到任何开除我的正当理由
What he won't find is anything that justifies firing me.

285
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,110
他肯定只是在审查你  我们对每个人都要审查
I'm sure he was just vetting you. We do that with everyone.

286
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,440
你非要这样说的话  那好吧
Okay, if that's your story, then fine,

287
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,420
但我只在乎赢得大选
but all I care about is winning this election.

288
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,680
我们放下个人恩怨  团结合作  好吗
So let's get past our personal shit and be a team, okay?

289
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,030
我们在对抗同一个敌人  总统先生
We're fighting a common enemy here, Mr. President.

290
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,320
我们保持团结十分重要
It's important that we remain united.

291
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,200
嗯  我向你保证我们采取任何行动前
Yeah, and I can assure you that Secretary Durant will reach out

292
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,340
杜兰特国务卿都会跟你联系
before we conduct any operation.

293
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,690
非常感谢  总统先生
Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

294
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,310
我们一想出计划就会联系你
We'll be in touch as soon as we come up with a plan.

295
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,980
你一副我还能当国务卿的样子
You're acting like I'll still be Secretary of State.

296
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,360
如果你决策正确  就会是的
Well, if you play your cards right, you will be.

297
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,550
你还请过谁当你的副总统
Who else did you offer the VP slot to?

298
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,730
杰姬  奥斯汀  我  还有谁
There's Jackie, Austen, me. Anyone else?

299
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,080
奥斯汀自愿退出的  杰姬也是
Austen withdrew on his own, and so did Jackie.

300
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,760
我没有逼她退出
I did not push her out.

301
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,540
杰姬说你毫不尊重她
Jackie says you took her for granted,

302
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,850
说你威胁她  恐吓她
that you bullied her, you intimidated her.

303
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,400
她正在给加州的代表们
And that is what she is telling every member

304
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,340
一个一个打电话说这番话
of the California delegation, one phone call at a time.

305
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,770
加州  票很多
California. Lots of votes.

306
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,110
加州  民主党大会最大的票仓
California, the largest piece of delegates at the Democratic Convention.

307
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,140
我听说代表团正在倾向希瑟·邓巴
I'm told that delegation is trending toward Heather Dunbar.

308
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,030
来看一下  沃尔夫
Let's watch this, Wolf.

309
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,970
想像一下她只拿下
Let's imagine she only picked up

310
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,430
加州三分之二的代表
two-thirds of the California delegates.

311
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,840
这就超过300票了
That gets you above 300 there.

312
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,730
另外  我们估计她能守住她家乡康涅狄格州
Plus, we assume she'll keep her home state Connecticut's support.

313
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,550
这样起点就相当不错
Off to a pretty good start.

314
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,930
超过300张代表票  大概是7%的选票了
It's over 300 delegates. What, roughly, uh, 7% of the vote?

315
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,390
单单这些就足以使投票进入第二轮了吧
That alone could take this, what, to a second ballot?

316
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,760
没错  又是开放党代会
That takes it to a second ballot, an open convention again.

317
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,830
而且我们预计
Plus, we also assume that

318
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,280
路易斯安那州会继续支持凯瑟琳·杜兰特
Louisiana will stay with Catherine Durant.

319
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,640
至少在第一轮投票结束前
So, we are not going to have a definitive idea

320
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,160
我们无法确切估计
of how all this is gonna shape up

321
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,650
局势将如何走向
at least until they conduct the first ballot.

322
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,710
目前总统和杜兰特国务卿
There's still no update as to, uh,

323
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,760
将何时返回尚无新消息
when the president and Secretary Durant will return.

324
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,310
是啊  这也增加了不确定性
No, and that adds to some of the uncertainty here.

325
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,570
我们回到现场  看看情况如何
So let's go back to the floor, see how things are playing out.

326
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,910
文章里没有说明
It didn't specify in the article

327
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,230
当时车队是朝哪个方向开的
which direction the motorcade was heading.

328
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,690
朝东
East.

329
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,320
你确定吗
You're sure?

330
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,810
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

331
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,810
我去
Hot damn!

332
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,410
我保证你想当多久国务卿都可以
I am promising you Secretary of State for as long as you want it

333
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,160
你2024年竞选总统时我会全力支持
and my full support when you run for President in 2024.

334
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,890
谁知道呢  你说不好会走运
I mean, who knows, you might even get lucky.

335
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,520
我的肝脏或许在那之前就衰竭了
My liver might fail before then.

336
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,070
你把我的职位许给贝克的时候
Your promises stopped meaning much

337
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,380
你的承诺就没有意义了
after you promised Baker my job.

338
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,810
我完全没打算让他当国务卿
I have no intention of offering him Secretary of State.

339
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,540
那么你就像沃克骗你一样骗了他
Oh, so you lied to him the way Walker lied to you.

340
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,580
不  我和沃克又不是老交情
No. Walker and I didn't have a history.

341
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,780
沃克也不尊重我
And Walker didn't respect me.

342
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,410
你我是有交情的  凯茜  我也非常尊重你
You and I have a history, Cathy, and I respect you immensely.

343
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,220
但是我们共事才3年
But our history goes back three years.

344
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,050
克莱尔和我已经是30年的搭档了
Claire's and my partnership goes back 30.

345
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,700
你必须尊重这一点
You have to respect that.

346
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,060
我可能会...
I might have...

347
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,270
如果你一开始就对我说实话的话
if you had been honest with me from the beginning.

348
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,510
我也希望时间能倒退  可现在已经这样了
Well, I wish I could turn back time, but here we are.

349
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,880
你可以把我挡在亚特兰大之外  想多久多久
And you can keep me out of Atlanta for as long as you want,

350
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,280
但你不能永远拖着选票
but you can't hold the vote back forever.

351
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,440
时间在前进不是倒退  而时间站在我这边
Time's moving forward, not back. And time is on my side.

352
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,540
如果希瑟·邓巴想占总统不在的便宜
If Heather Dunbar wants to take advantage of the President's absence,

353
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,800
那是她的权利
that's her prerogative.

354
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,250
但是她仍在华府  也未发表公开声明
But she's still in D.C., there's no public statement.

355
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,370
你认为这是占便宜
You see that as taking advantage?

356
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,190
你认为如果不是她在华府幕后操纵
You think Congresswoman Sharp would make calls on her behalf

357
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,310
夏普议员会代表她打电话拉票吗
if she wasn't pulling the strings from Washington?

358
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,330
夏普说是她自己打的
Sharp says she's doing it on her own.

359
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,830
你没有任何证据表明她们有合作
You don't have any proof of coordination.

360
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,390
你说得对  我没有
You're right, I don't.

361
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,510
只是清楚人性  基本逻辑
Just human nature, basic logic,

362
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,250
而且比常人更了解
and a slightly better than average understanding

363
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,990
政治手腕
of political gamesmanship.

364
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,670
失陪一下  新闻发言人也要上厕所
Uh, if you will excuse me, even press secretaries have to pee.

365
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,830
-我马上回来  -好的
- I'll just be right back. - Okay.

366
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,980
失陪  抱歉  失陪
Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

367
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,600
怎么了
What's up?

368
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,060
莉安知道了  我认为是你告诉了她
LeAnn knows, and I think you told her.

369
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,880
对  直截了当  我全告诉她了
I did. Straight up. I told her everything.

370
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,050
-走  上楼去  -不
- Let's go. Upstairs. - No.

371
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,100
-你说什么  -邓巴重回局内
- Excuse me? - You've got Dunbar in play,

372
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,630
杜兰特和总统在一起
you got Durant with the President,

373
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,310
第一夫人在达拉斯
and the First Lady's in Dallas.

374
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,430
这里的一屋子记者
And I've got a room full of press

375
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,980
我从早上八点就在努力应付他们
that I've been keeping at bay since 8:00 this morning,

376
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,480
等我把熊孩子都哄睡了
so I will tell you why I told her...

377
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,260
再跟你讲我为什么告诉她吧
after I tuck in all the children.

378
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,980
现在投票
Let's vote now!

379
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
请安静一下
Order, please!

380
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,750
现在请希尔参议员讲话
It is Senator Sheer's time to speak.

381
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,770
安静
Order!

382
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,980
也许我们应该遂凯茜的愿
Maybe we should let Cathy have her way.

383
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,550
如果现在投票  你们获胜  我们大选再战
If the vote's held now, you two win. We focus on the general.

384
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,250
为什么这么说
What's brought all this on?

385
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,690
我只是在想我们这么做
I just wonder if we're in over our heads,

386
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,410
是不是不自量力  弗兰西斯
Francis, trying to do this.

387
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,740
是因为你母亲吗
Is it your mother?

388
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,020
看到她病得这么重一定很不好受吧
I'm sure it's difficult to see her this sick.

389
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,490
她完全无助
She's completely helpless.

390
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,190
但我们并不无助  我们可以扭转局势
But we're not helpless. We can turn this around.

391
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,980
我想我只是...
I guess I'm just...

392
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,590
我不知道  也许我们做错了
I don't know, maybe... maybe we're making a mistake.

393
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,030
也许我还没准备好做你的竞选搭档
Maybe I'm not ready to be your running mate.

394
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,400
-康威有个四星将军  -你母亲快乐吗
- Conway has a four-star general. - Is she happy, your mother?

395
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,190
不  她很痛苦
No, she's miserable.

396
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,280
汤姆逗她笑  但大多数时候不快乐
Tom makes her laugh, but mostly, no.

397
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,770
想象一下我肝衰竭了
Imagine my liver's failing.

398
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,080
-想象我要死了  -弗兰西斯
- Imagine I'm dying. - Francis...

399
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,770
不  你就想象一下
No, I just want you to picture it for just a moment.

400
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,950
我躺在床上  像你母亲现在一样
There I am, lying in a bed just like your mother is now.

401
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,560
唯一能让我高兴的事
The only thing that would make me happy

402
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,850
就是知道我走了以后  你会接手
is to know that you would take over after I passed.

403
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,970
如果是凯茜
If it were Cathy...

404
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,200
我会和你母亲一样痛苦的
I'd be just as miserable as your mother is.

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,420
我会做好我的事
I'll do my part.

406
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,510
你就专注你的讲话
You just concentrate on that speech.

407
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,750
好  谢谢你  弗兰西斯
All right. Thank you, Francis.

408
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,670
晚安
Good night.

409
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,710
-她不吃东西吗  -她吞咽很困难
- She, uh... she won't eat? - It's hard for her to swallow.

410
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,940
你觉得她还有多少时间
How much time do you think she has?

411
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,420
我说不准  可能是几周
I can't be definitive, but... a couple of weeks, maybe.

412
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,000
如果她完全不进食  可能就只有几天了
If she stops eating altogether, it could be days.

413
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,770
她很痛苦
She's in a lot of pain.

414
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,740
她可以不用这么痛苦
She doesn't have to be.

415
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,910
到了这一步  我们可以让她舒适一些
When it gets to this point, we can make her comfortable.

416
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,420
舒适到让她的身体不再挣扎
Comfortable enough that the body will let go.

417
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,270
那是她想要的吗
Does she want that?

418
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,070
这个你该和你母亲讨论一下
That is something you should discuss with your mother.

419
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,970
我喜欢那些植物
I like the plants.

420
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,380
你放在那儿的那些
The plants you put in there.

421
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,530
小东西总能让人眼前一亮  对吧
It's the little things, right?

422
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,790
如果我们干掉精炼厂
If we take out the refineries,

423
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,490
就能切断他们的收入来源
that would eliminate their revenue stream.

424
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,920
没有了资源  他们就无法进军
They can't advance if they don't have the resources.

425
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,140
马克宗总统明确表示
President Makhzun made it very clear

426
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,880
不希望精炼厂被毁
he wants those to remain intact.

427
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,360
从战略角度看  那是我们最好的选择
It's our best option from a strategic point of view.

428
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,280
伤亡最小  对他们能力的冲击最大
Minimal loss of life, maximal impact on capability.

429
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,010
要么全面开战  要么就不打
It's either total war or nothing at all.

430
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,410
这可不符合外交策略  凯茜
Well, that doesn't sound very diplomatic, Cathy.

431
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,640
我们要和恐怖分子谈外交吗
We're going to be diplomatic with terrorists?

432
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,820
我向马克宗总统承诺过
I made a promise to President Makhzun.

433
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,930
你之前就违背过诺言  这次有什么不同
You've broken promises before. Why should this be any different?

434
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,160
不如我们休息一下  晚餐之后继续吧
Why don't we break for dinner? We'll pick this up afterwards.

435
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,420
我想再考虑一下
I wanna review this a bit more.

436
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,290
我会让人把食物送去罗斯福室
I'll have some food brought into the Roosevelt Room.

437
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,930
感谢各位
Thank you all very much.

438
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,280
凯茜  我们俩就在这里吃吧
Cathy, why don't you and I eat in here?

439
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,330
"要么全面开战  要么就不打"
"Total war or nothing at all"?

440
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,080
如果我在镜头前说
The moment I get in front of those cameras

441
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,870
康威是对的  布洛哈特也是对的
and I tell them that Conway is right and Brockhart is right,

442
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,390
你把哈里发国的事完全搞砸了
and that you completely bungled the ICO situation,

443
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,510
你觉得邓巴到时会怎么样
how do you think Dunbar will do then?

444
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,270
请送两份科布沙拉过来  谢谢
Can we get two Cobb salads in here, please?

445
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,490
-我不喜欢科布沙拉  -那你可以不吃
- I don't like Cobb salad. - Then you don't have to eat it.

446
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,980
谢谢你过来
Thanks for coming over.

447
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,040
我过来比你过去容易多了
Way easier coming here than you coming there.

448
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,000
我门外有十支新闻团队守着呢
Must be ten news crews outside of my house.

449
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,130
你怎么跑出来的
How'd you escape?

450
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,990
老办法  走后门
The old-fashioned way. Back door.

451
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,800
你怎么弄到我的住宅电话的
How did you get my home phone?

452
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,170
老办法
Oh, old-fashioned way.

453
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,540
《先驱报》的联络簿
Rolodex from the Herald.

454
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,170
-跟我来  不会很久的  -好
- Come with me. I won't keep you long. - Yeah.

455
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,240
-这些花了你多少时间  -几个月
- How long did this take you? - Couple of months.

456
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,830
我单独做的
I've been working on my own.

457
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,180
我们有一整队人手  都没发现这个
We had a whole team and we didn't find this.

458
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,250
你们或许没有深挖到贝茨城葡萄园
Well, you probably weren't digging as deep as the Bates City Vine.

459
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,480
没有
No.

460
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,390
我们把大部分精力放在追踪资金上了
We spent most of our energy tracking the money.

461
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,730
我们应该更关注出行记录的
We should've been more focused on the travel logs.

462
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,240
我是和一个披萨店的人聊了之后才想到的
I wouldn't have checked either until I spoke with a pizza guy.

463
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,350
后来我想到  他们有可能篡改出行记录
Then I realized they might be manipulating the logs.

464
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,230
于是你查到了拉尼根
Which gets you to Lanagin.

465
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,460
这还是不能证明他见了拉尼根
It still doesn't prove he met with Lanagin,

466
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,950
但我不知道车队还能去哪
but I don't know where else that motorcade would've been heading.

467
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,780
你打算把这个公开吗
Are you going public with this?

468
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,900
我是可以  但是他还能合理推诿
I could, but he has some plausible deniability.

469
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,310
全都推到密查姆身上
He pins it all on Meechum.

470
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,680
如果他掩盖了行踪
If he's covering up travel,

471
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,730
谁知道他还掩盖了什么
who knows what else he's covering up?

472
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,700
那才是我想要的报道
That's the story I want,

473
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,470
而不是什么特勤局人员修改记录
not some Secret Service man being loose with the books.

474
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,120
那你还没有引起注意
So you're still under the radar.

475
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,570
我得请你对这一切保密
I have to ask you to keep all this to yourself.

476
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,070
我知道你现在有了机会  这很诱人
I know it can be tempting now that... you have a chance,

477
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,020
但如果这一切过早公布  他会提高警惕
but if this goes public too early, his guard goes up.

478
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,850
我退出选举的时候很艰难
Listen, it was hard when I withdrew.

479
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,580
半数领导层和公众都抛弃了我
How the leadership abandoned me, how the public did.

480
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,980
花了些时间
It took some time...

481
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,920
但我看开了
but I made my peace.

482
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,350
我是赢是输本来就不好说
It's a crapshoot whether I can win this.

483
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,070
他可以反驳这样的报道
He can probably fight that off.

484
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,240
你得写一篇他无法反驳的报道
You need to write the story that he can't fight off.

485
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,160
你调查过他  突破点在哪里
You investigated him. Where's the weak link?

486
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,070
雷米·丹顿
Remy Danton.

487
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,750
那是汤姆弄的
Tom did that.

488
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,180
真遗憾  他会合适你的
It's a shame. He'd be good for you.

489
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,420
我从没相信过牙仙
I never believed in the tooth fairy.

490
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,720
但你还是把钱拿走了
Well, you took the money anyway.

491
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,040
能帮我把那盏灯关了吗  很刺眼
Could you turn off that light, please? Hurts my eyes.

492
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,720
你小时候  曾经
When you were small... you used to...

493
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,600
曾经求我  让黑暗停止
used to ask me to make it stop, the dark.

494
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,700
你还记得吗
Do you remember?

495
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,630
记得
Yes.

496
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,160
我向你保证我会的  早上就让它停
And I promised you I would... in the morning.

497
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,380
但该死的  你会每天晚上
But, damn it, you would sit at that window...

498
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,050
坐在窗前
every night...

499
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,870
想凭自己的力量让太阳升起来
trying to make the sun rise, all by yourself.

500
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,470
你脸靠在窗户上睡着后
Your daddy would put you in bed...

501
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,170
你爸爸会把你抱上床
after you'd fallen asleep with your face against the glass.

502
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,110
我那时非常嫉妒
And I was so jealous.

503
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,910
嫉妒我和爸爸吗
Of me and Daddy?

504
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,850
嫉妒你相信
That you believed.

505
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,950
你相信你可以让太阳升起
You believed you could make the sun rise.

506
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,260
我跟护士谈了  母亲
I spoke to her, Mother, the nurse.

507
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,940
我做不到
I can't do it.

508
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,890
我做不到  母亲
I can't do it, Mother.

509
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,100
我做不到你要我做的事
I can't do what you want me to do.

510
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,880
克莱尔
Claire...

511
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,250
你母亲去世
it'd help you win...

512
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,260
会帮你赢的
having your mother gone.

513
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,160
为我做这件事
Do this for me.

514
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,640
让我终于能
And let me be a help to you.

515
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,850
帮到你
Finally.

516
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,350
汤姆
Tom.

517
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,740
她想要你在场
She wants you to be there.

518
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,200
你想要什么呢
What do you want?

519
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,360
我也想要你在场
I want you to be there, too.

520
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,180
好了
Okay.

521
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,740
我告诉她是因为你让我别无选择
I told her because you put me in an impossible situation.

522
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,320
她没有把柄  但你就是不听
There's nothing on her, but you wouldn't listen.

523
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,190
那你来我家的时候肯定也没听进去
And you must not have listened when you came over to my house.

524
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,630
我说得很清楚
I was very clear.

525
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,120
那么  你又要把我丢到地上吗
So... you're gonna throw me on the ground again?

526
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,230
看  这里有杯子  来吧
Look, here's a glass. Let's go ahead.

527
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,370
你要把我炒掉吗
You wanna fire me?

528
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,200
好啊  不就是又有人辞职吗
Fine. It's another resignation.

529
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,830
继雷米  布洛哈特之后
After Remy, after Brockhart.

530
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,420
杜兰特和邓巴还虎视眈眈
With Durant, with Dunbar.

531
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,690
我是靠编故事谋生的
You know, I spin stories for a living.

532
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,960
我都形容不出这故事有多好拿来做文章
I can't begin to tell you how to spin this.

533
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,040
你开小冰箱可不是为了拿健怡可乐
You know, the minibar wasn't open because you wanted a Diet Coke.

534
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,450
我担心你  道格
I'm worried about you, Doug.

535
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,110
我不需要人担心
Nobody needs to worry about me.

536
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,330
你需要有人担心你
Yeah, somebody does...

537
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,320
因为这个焦土政策对我们很不好
because this scorched-earth policy is bad for us.

538
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,970
我才不在乎莉安·哈维  我们需要她
I don't give a rat's ass about LeAnn Harvey. We need her.

539
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,190
而你需要我  但我们都需要你
And you need me. And we both need you.

540
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,850
-处在最佳状态  -我很好
- At your best. - I'm fine.

541
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,370
是吗  你不让我控制损失
Are you? Instead of having me do damage control,

542
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,330
反而让我伤害自己人
you're having me do damage to one of our own.

543
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,280
我是在保护总统
I am trying to protect the president.

544
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,420
而我是在保护你
And I'm trying to protect you...

545
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,470
免受自己的伤害
from yourself.

546
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,110
你别瞎说了  你才不在乎我
You're so full of shit. You don't care about me.

547
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,190
你干了那种事  我本该恨你
After what you did, I should hate you.

548
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,720
但那样能给我们带来什么呢
But where does it get us?

549
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,600
看一下《电讯报》吧
Check out the Telegraph.

550
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,780
策略起效了
The strategy is working...

551
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,740
如果你肯的话
if you let it.

552
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,500
或者逼我辞职  你决定
Or make me resign. Your call.

553
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,640
-你还好吗  -那是她想要的
- Are you okay? - It's what she wanted.

554
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,140
我在问你
I was asking you.

555
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,200
把投票安排到明天
Schedule the vote for tomorrow.

556
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,620
我会飞回去在投票前讲话
I'll fly back to speak just before.

557
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,930
克莱尔  你母亲刚刚去世了
Claire, your mother just passed.

558
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,420
安排一下  弗兰西斯
Schedule it, Francis.

559
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,770
汤姆写了一篇讲稿  很不错
Tom wrote a speech. It's good.

560
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,450
-凯茜还没同意  -那就逼她同意
- Cathy's not on board yet. - Then get her on board.

561
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,040
抱歉
I'm sorry.

562
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,690
-我不是...  -不不  没关系
- I didn't mean to-- - No, no, it's all right.

563
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,750
我会搞定的
I'll get it done.

564
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,720
谢谢  明天见
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

565
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,630
晚安
Good night.

566
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,560
让杜兰特国务卿去总统办公室见我
Ask Secretary Durant to meet me in the Oval.

567
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,250
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

568
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,770
总统先生
Mr. President.

569
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,510
在咖啡桌上
Coffee table.

570
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,100
有趣的是我都没让他这么做
The funny thing is I didn't even have to ask him to do it.

571
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,700
他自己做的
He did it on his own.

572
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,380
我尤其喜欢他说
I especially like where he says,

573
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,460
"凯瑟琳·杜兰特堪用
"Catherine Durant is functional.

574
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,060
克莱尔·安德伍德强大"
Claire Underwood is formidable."

575
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,340
你看  时间没有站在你那边  而在我们这边
So, you see, you don't even have time on your side. It's on ours.

576
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,880
到明天早上  会有十几篇类似报道
By tomorrow morning, there'll be a dozen articles just like that.

577
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,320
所以你可以做选择
So you have a choice.

578
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,600
你可以选择在接下来四年中继续当国务卿
You can redeem yourself as Secretary of State

579
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,360
重树形象
over the next four years,

580
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,940
或选择被世人铭记为  在中东办砸了事
or go down in history as a fluke, who bungled the Middle East

581
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,180
在勃兰登堡谈不拢协议的没用货
and couldn't even close the deal in Brandenburg.

582
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,210
你有你的版本  我也有我的
You have your version. I have mine.

583
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,310
我相信我的版本会跟这个一样引人注目
I'm sure mine will get just as much traction as this.

584
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,710
但是我的版本会赢  因为这个报道更有意思
But my version wins because it's the better story...

585
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,680
并且事情也确实如此
and it's also exactly how things went down.

586
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,060
你看连真相都不向着你
You see, you don't even have the truth going for you.

587
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,900
我不怕你
I'm not scared of you.

588
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:34,010
我背书邓巴  会是一篇更好的报道
My endorsement of Dunbar, that makes for an even better story.

589
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,100
但你知道最棒的报道是什么吗
But you wanna know what the best story is?

590
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,970
克莱尔的母亲刚去世了
Claire's mother just died.

591
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,860
-我很遗憾  -我想你不是真心的
- I'm sorry to hear that. - Oh, I don't think you really are,

592
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,140
不过没关系  反正全世界除了你都会难过
but that doesn't matter because the rest of the world will.

593
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,850
等她明晚做完讲话
And by the time she gives her speech tomorrow night,

594
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,160
亚特兰大乃至全国的观众
there won't be a dry eye in Atlanta

595
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,710
都会为之动容落泪
or across the rest of the country.

596
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,840
你可以保住你的工作  凯茜  
So, you get to keep your job, Cathy,

597
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,940
只要以你代表的票为交换
in return for your delegates.

598
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,720
这个提议依然有效
That offer is still on the table.

599
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,890
我一直很忠诚  我帮你得到了这个位置
I have been loyal. I got you that table.

600
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,830
你想继续守住  还是想拱手让给康威
Do you wanna keep it, or do you wanna give it to Conway?

601
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,770
我在等移植手术的时候
You know, when I was waiting for my transplant,

602
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,870
我产生了特别逼真的幻觉  你都不会相信
I had the most vivid hallucinations. You wouldn't believe 'em.

603
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,520
你知道我看到谁了吗
Do you know who I saw?

604
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,720
彼得·罗素和佐伊·巴恩斯  就在这个办公室里
Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes, right here in this room.

605
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,220
佐伊就在这张沙发上引诱我
Zoe was trying to seduce me, right here on this couch,

606
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,330
而彼得把我的脸按在这块玻璃上
and Peter, he shoved my face up against this glass.

607
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,230
香烟  剃须刀片和性爱
Cigarettes and razor blades and sex.

608
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,440
很可怕
It was terrifying.

609
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,630
我只想逃出这间
All I wanted to do was get out of this room

610
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,600
我费劲千辛万苦才进来的房间
that I worked so hard to get in.

611
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,100
但它们阴魂不散是有道理的
But of course, it makes sense that they would've haunted me

612
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,560
因为全都是真的
because it's all true.

613
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,380
-什么是真的  -卢卡斯·古德温所说的一切
- What is? - Everything Lucas Goodwin claimed.

614
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,310
我杀了他们两个  就像他说的那样
I killed them both, just like he said I did.

615
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,920
但当然没人会相信  永远不会有人相信
But of course, nobody believes it, and nobody ever will.

616
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,690
因为我们就是那么擅长
Because that's how good we are...

617
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,270
让东西
at making things...

618
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,020
消失
disappear.

619
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,310
不  我们没杀过人
No, we didn't kill anybody.

620
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,360
但如果需要
But we would have...

621
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,410
我们会的
if it was necessary.

622
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,020
你说得对  谈判该结束了
So, you're right, the time for negotiations is over.

623
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,800
你要交出你的代表
You will hand over your delegates,

624
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,200
继续在我的内阁任职
and you will serve on in my cabinet.

625
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,350
我们忘掉发生过的这一切
And we will forget that any of this ever happened.

626
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,350
因为如果你不照做
Because if you don't...

627
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,420
我向上帝发誓
I swear to God...

628
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,120
我永远
I will never...

629
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,720
都不会忘记
ever forget.

630
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,370
现在你明白了吗
Do you understand now?

631
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,180
明白
Yes.

632
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,460
好
Good.

633
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,580
我们去决定要怎么对付恐怖分子吧
Now, let's go decide what we're gonna do about these terrorists.

634
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,790
需要我给谁打电话吗  做些安排
Want me to call someone? Make arrangements?

635
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,320
我们让太阳升起来了
We made the sun rise.

636
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,250
这她也告诉你了
She told you that, too?

637
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,990
我们该动身了
We should get going.

638
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,420
我和汉娜想向第一夫人和总统
Me and Hannah want to extend our warmest condolences

639
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,020
致以最诚挚的哀悼
to the First Lady and the President.

640
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,510
我们为他们和伊丽莎白·黑尔的亲人们祈祷
They and all of Elizabeth Hale's loved ones are in our prayers.

641
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,740
出于对离世之人的尊敬  今天我们不竞选
And we won't be campaigning today out of respect for their loss.

642
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,400
愿上帝保佑总统夫妇
God bless President and Mrs. Underwood.

643
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,370
好了
Got it.

644
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,310
发布吧
Put it out.

645
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,950
她倒毙的时机掐得真好
Perfect timing... for her to drop dead.

646
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,740
我们本来正顺风顺水呢
We were on a roll, too.

647
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,270
我该准备讲话了
I should prep for the speech.

648
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,970
我为你准备好了房间  我马上就过去
I have a room set up for you. I'll be right in.

649
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,820
这边请  安德伍德夫人
Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.

650
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,530
我读过草稿了
I read the draft.

651
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,700
怎么样
And?

652
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,630
-一个字都不用改  -我很高兴你满意
- I wouldn't change a thing. - I'm glad you're pleased.

653
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,030
我很高兴你陪着她
I'm glad you were with her.

654
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,780
她很坚强  你很幸运
She's strong. You're a lucky man.

655
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,180
完全同意
Don't I know it.

656
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,790
女士们先生们  我很荣幸为大家介绍
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to introduce

657
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:15,730
国务卿凯瑟琳·杜兰特
Secretary of State Catherine Durant.

658
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,560
谢谢  非常感谢大家
Thank you, thank you very much.

659
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,400
我知道大家和我一样
I know that all of you join me

660
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,770
都对第一夫人亲人的离世表示诚挚慰唁
in offering our sincere condolences to the First Lady for her loss.

661
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:54,000
今晚  我想向在代表大会上
Tonight, I want to offer my sincere gratitude

662
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,910
支持我的各位代表
to all the delegates who have honored me with their support

663
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,800
致以我最真挚的感谢
during the course of this convention.

664
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,460
我非常感谢你们
Thank you so much.

665
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:13,420
然而  经过深思熟虑
However, after much deliberation...

666
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,900
我决定  与辞职参加选举相比  作为国务卿
I have decided that I have more to offer you as Secretary of State

667
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,190
我能更好地为大家服务
than to resign and run for office.

668
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:29,980
但我希望支持我的各位
But I want to encourage every one of you who has supported me

669
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,970
和我一起支持这位非凡的女性
to join me in supporting this extraordinary woman,

670
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,230
美国第一夫人  克莱尔·黑尔·安德伍德
the First Lady of the United States, Claire Hale Underwood.

671
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,460
谢谢
Thank you.

672
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,540
谢谢
Thank you.

673
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,740
晚上好
And good evening.

674
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,780
正如大家所知  我母亲
As all of you know, my mother,

675
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,890
伊丽莎白·康斯坦斯·黑尔
Elizabeth Constance Hale,

676
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,340
久病后于昨晚去世
passed away last night after a long illness.

677
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,870
她是个坚强的女人...
She was a strong woman...

678
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,000
一个生猛的德州人
a fierce Texan...

679
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:39,400
从小...我和她关系就不好
We had... a difficult relationship from childhood onwards.

680
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,850
我们曾有过很长时间的疏离
At times, there were long periods of estrangement.

681
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,970
我们经常深深地伤害对方
We hurt each other... often and deeply.

682
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,830
如果说母亲的病带来了什么好事  那就是
If there was one good thing that came from my mother's illness...

683
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,570
让我们有机会重新开始往来  抚平旧伤
it gave us a chance to reconnect, to mend old wounds.

684
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,370
人们并不是都能
And that's not an opportunity

685
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,910
在父母离世前有这样的机会
people always get before a parent dies,

686
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,110
我很感激有这样的机会
and I'm grateful to have had that.

687
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,990
那我在这里做什么呢
And what am I doing here?

688
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:22,700
我站在这里  是因为这是我母亲所希望的
I'm here because my mother wanted me to be.

689
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,860
昨天在她去世之前  她对我说
Yesterday, before she passed, she said to me,

690
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,710
"克莱尔...去做吧
"Claire... do this.

691
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,860
如果这是人们希望的  听他们的
If the people want it, listen to them.

692
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,690
如果失败了  那就是失败了
And if you lose, then you lose.

693
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,970
但是如果你赢了...
But if you win...

694
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,160
要感到荣幸  保持谦逊
be honored, be humbled,

695
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,750
和弗兰西斯一起赢得选举"
and win this election with Francis!"

696
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,030
我告诉她  康威夫妇是非常厉害的对手
And I told her, I said, "The Conways are tough opponents."

697
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,780
她说也许是吧  但也不比德州人
And she said, "They may be tough, but they're not Texas tough."

698
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,340
失去让我们深思
Loss is a sobering phenomenon.

699
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,870
几个月前  我差点失去了我丈夫
Several months ago, I almost lost my husband.

700
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,160
我们的国家差点失去了总统
Our nation almost lost a President.

701
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,440
失去让我们重新审视我们珍惜的一切
Loss makes us reevaluate what we hold dear.

702
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,740
我还要告诉你们...
And I'll tell you, there were...

703
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,130
就在不久之前
times in the not too distant past,

704
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:35,120
弗兰西斯和我...差点失去我们的婚姻
where Francis and I, we... almost lost our marriage.

705
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,390
我们遇到了困难  还以为坚持不下去了
Hard times when we thought we wouldn't make it.

706
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,800
正如很多人所知
And like many of you know,

707
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,400
婚姻并非总是一帆风顺
marriage isn't always the smoothest road.

708
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,920
是一个精神错乱的年轻人
And it took the actions of a deranged young man

709
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,660
让我记起弗兰西斯对我有多重要
to remind me how important Francis is to me.

710
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,090
现在  我母亲去世了...
And now, with my mother gone...

711
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,770
他就是我唯一的亲人了
he's the only family I have left.

712
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,150
我愿把我的人生  我们的国家和未来
I trust Francis Underwood with my life,

713
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,910
托付给弗兰西斯·安德伍德
with our nation, with our future.

714
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,570
我希望你们也能信任他
I hope you will, too.

715
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,150
如果你们信任我们  我会谨遵母亲的话
And if you trust the both of us, I'll heed my mother's words,

716
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:28,970
如被提名为他的竞选搭档  我将深感荣幸
and I'll be honored if you nominate me as his running mate.

717
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:51,280
克莱尔  克莱尔  克莱尔
Claire! Claire! Claire!

718
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,180
天呐  你真厉害
Jesus! You did great work.

719
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,460
女士们先生们...
Ladies and gentlemen...

720
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,200
秘书长女士  作为党代会主席
Madam Secretary, as Convention Chair,

721
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,150
我提议通过口头表决  对提名
I move that we make the nomination

722
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,670
克莱尔·安德伍德竞选副总统
of Claire Underwood for Vice President...

723
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,700
