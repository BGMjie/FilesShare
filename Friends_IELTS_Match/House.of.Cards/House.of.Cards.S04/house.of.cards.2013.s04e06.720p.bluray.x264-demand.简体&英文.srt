美方只用拿出八千亿中的一千五百亿
The US would only have to contribute 150 of the $800 billion.

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,340
俄罗斯企业会监督生产

37
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,270
我们割让了开采权吗
We split the drilling rights?

38
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,200
是的  先生  中国出了更多钱
Yes, sir. China puts in more money,

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,000
我们就拿出我们的开采技术
but we contribute our drilling technology.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,270
分享技术真的好吗
Should we really be sharing that?

41
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,180
他们早就想从我们这儿偷学了
They're already trying to hack it from us.

42
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,720
佩特罗夫同意了吗
Has Petrov agreed to this?

43
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,780
我打算在

44
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,270
德国勃兰登堡的七国峰会上跟他提
it to him in Brandenburg at the G7 Summit.

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,550
我们已邀请俄罗斯和中国参加
We've invited Russia and China to attend,

46
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,920
但国会批准前
but we didn't wanna move forward

47
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,040
我们不想采取进一步行动
until we had congressional approval.

48
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,220
-鲍勃  -我们该私下谈
- Bob? - We should discuss privately.

49
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,350
你要亲自去勃兰登堡吗
You're going to Brandenburg yourself?

50
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,750
如果他的病情继续恶化
If his health continues to worsen--

51
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,400
之后再看情况
We'll assess as we get closer,

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,330
但如果情况悲观我就不去
but, no, I'll stay here if it looks dire.

53
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,820
我们应该起草拨款申请
We should probably draft an appropriation

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,390
以防需要举办国葬
in case we need to pay for a state funeral.

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,660
-道格  -部长女士
- Doug. - Madam Secretary.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,870
我可以去白宫的
I could've come to the White House.

57
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,080
器官供应组织要听命于你
The organ network, it answers to you.

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,100
说对了一半  从监管方面来说...
Yes and no. Uh, in a regulatory capacity--

59
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,040
你有权力调整器官接受人名单
You have the power to modify the recipient list.

60
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,810
顺序由供应组织决定
That's up to the network.

61
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,370
他们有专家委员会...
They have an expert committee that--

62
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,490
总统的生命不能由一个委员会决定
The president's life isn't going to be decided by a committee.

63
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,800
我给你看点东西
Let me show you something.

64
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,590
他昨天是第三位  第一位已经移植了
He was number three yesterday. Number one got a transplant.

65
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,530
总统现在是第二位  他活的机会很大
Makes the president number two. His chances are very good.

66
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,010
但这个安东尼·莫雷蒂再过几小时就要死了
But this man, Anthony Moretti, he's just hours away from dying.

67
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,180
那就让他死
Then let him die.

68
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,650
我不会这么做的
I'm not doing this.

69
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,120
不仅违法  也有违道德
It's not just the law. It's the ethics--

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,060
那就改变你的道德标准
Then change your ethics.

71
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,830
不然你就辞职  让副部长打这个电话
Or you can resign, and your deputy can make this call.

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,380
如果他不愿意  那他也辞职
And if he won't, then he can resign, too.

73
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,570
我会把这个部门翻个底朝天  找到我需要的人
I will strip away this entire department until I find who I need.

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,920
打电话吧
Now make the call.

75
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,540
-好  我上去了  -你用过吗
- Okay, I'm on. - You ever use it?

76
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,730
不  我一般用谷歌
No, I use Google.

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,970
它市场份额很小
Uh, it's a small market share,

78
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,090
但一个月仍有数十亿次搜索
but still, it's billions of searches a month.

79
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,690
如果一个候选人有更多点击量
Now, what if a certain candidate got more hits,

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,910
排名更靠前
was ranked higher,

81
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,370
正面报道多过负面报道呢
more positive coverage favored over negative coverage?

82
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,290
如果那个候选人是威廉·康威呢
What if that candidate was William Conway?

83
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,690
操纵搜索结果  公众会与他们反目的
Manipulating searches? The public would turn on them.

84
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,300
帮他们拉到了上百万的选票
It gets them millions of votes.

85
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,490
能弄到确凿证据吗
Can you get me solid proof?

86
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,690
我不会参与这样的事
Well, I am not getting involved in something like this.

87
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,890
我只会作为朋友  给你友善的建议
What I will give you is advice as a friend.

88
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,410
别把一年的时光浪费在安德伍德夫妇身上
Don't waste a year of your life on the Underwoods.

89
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,150
他们已经输掉了竞选
They've already lost the election

90
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,910
而且自己还没有意识到
and they don't even realize it.

91
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,110
我知道你只是想帮忙
I know you're only trying to help,

92
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,200
也明白你肯定很担心
and I'm sure you must feel frightened

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,970
弗兰克的情况
about Frank's condition--

94
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,010
你没必要拐弯抹角  凯茜
You don't have to be delicate, Cathy.

95
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,090
我希望你不要干涉我的工作
I'd like you to let me do my job.

96
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,550
中国不能成为谈判的核心
China cannot be at the center of this negotiation,

97
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,490
雷蒙德·塔斯克也不行
or Raymond Tusk.

98
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,830
把石油公司牵扯进来
Involving the oil companies

99
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,380
是我们赢得共和党支持的唯一办法
is the only shot we have at winning Republican support.

100
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,260
还记得那次玩啤酒乒乓球  你放水让我赢吗
Do you remember when we played beer pong and you let me win?

101
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,530
我们两个就坐在那边
The two of us were sitting right over there,

102
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,530
那两张椅子上
in those two chairs,

103
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,010
你征求了我的意见
and you asked me for my advice.

104
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,020
那是一条好建议
It was good advice.

105
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,780
你也接受了  我不明白你现在为什么不肯接受
And you listened to it. I don't know why you won't now.

106
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,110
你上次提的是建设性意见  这次却不是
You were proposing a way forward. This time you're not.

107
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,390
与你不同  我是由参议院委任的
Well, unlike you, my nomination was confirmed by the Senate,

108
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,810
因为他们相信我知道自己在做什么
because they believed I knew what I was doing.

109
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,610
很抱歉  克莱尔  但在我看来
Forgive me, Claire, but it seems to me

110
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,140
你正在利用现在的局面  行使一些
that you are taking advantage of the situation to assert authority

111
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,330
-你无权行使的权力  -凯茜
- you don't have a right to assert. - Cathy,

112
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,220
弗兰西斯现在不在
you don't have Francis right now.

113
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,340
我是你的最佳选择
I'm the best thing you've got,

114
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,800
请与我共同解决这个问题吧
so please work with me on this.

115
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,300
国会不会批准的
Congress will never approve this.

116
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,210
你在浪费大家的时间
You're just wasting everybody's time.

117
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,140
共和党会支持的
The Republicans will get in line.

118
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,440
不是共和党  是民主党
Not the Republicans, the Democrats.

119
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,010
我跟杰姬·夏普谈过
I spoke to Jackie Sharp.

120
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,300
当她得知是你制定了这个计划...
When she heard you developed this plan...

121
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,120
她是个厉害的女人  克莱尔  而且很有说服力
She's a formidable woman, Claire, and very persuasive.

122
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,970
-雷米·丹顿  -雷米  我们得谈谈杰姬
- Remy Danton. - Remy, we need to talk about Jackie.

123
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,640
多美的夜晚
Such a nice night.

124
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,560
我们出去走走吧
Let's go somewhere outside.

125
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,920
你想去哪
And where do you wanna go?

126
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,030
带我去海湾吧
Take me to the bay.

127
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,100
我们去裸泳
We'll go skinny-dipping.

128
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,390
你不是只有几个小时时间吗
I thought you only had a couple hours.

129
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,320
我可以找到借口的
I'll make up some excuse.

130
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,720
我在酒店待腻了
I'm sick of hotel rooms.

131
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,750
咱俩明天还有事呢
We both got a big day tomorrow.

132
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,000
你怎么这么扫兴
Why are you being no fun?

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,180
因为你要搅黄我的法案
Because you're trying to kill my bill.

134
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,170
你不是想见我  你是来游说我的
You didn't wanna see me. You wanted to lobby me.

135
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,480
-杰姬  -是谁告诉你我反对的
- Jackie, listen. - Who told you I was against it?

136
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,240
博奇的幕僚长
Birch's Chief of Staff.

137
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,820
我相信你能从中捞到不少钱  但是...
Well, I'm sure you stand to make a lot of money on this, but--

138
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,810
不是因为钱
It's not about the money.

139
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,000
克莱尔不是靠钱说服你的吗
Isn't that how Claire convinced you?

140
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,440
我今晚不想谈
I just wanted to leave it tonight.

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
我不想冲你发火
I didn't wanna be mad at you.

142
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,100
我只想
I just wanted...

143
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,410
我不明白你为什么要帮她
I don't understand why you're helping her.

144
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,070
你得让博奇同意
You've gotta get Birch on board.

145
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,940
安德伍德夫妇欺骗过我
The Underwoods have lied to me,

146
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,850
利用过我  还试图威胁我
they've used me, they've tried to intimidate me.

147
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,190
我不知道克莱尔想干什么
I don't know what Claire's up to,

148
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,980
但我决不会坐以待毙
but I'm not gonna let it happen without a fight,

149
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,630
而且国务院都已经反对了
not with the State Department against it.

150
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,970
克莱尔知道了
Claire knows.

151
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,400
我们俩的事
About you and me.

152
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,820
她有我们的照片
She got photographs

153
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,400
多次同时离开同一家酒店
of us leaving the same hotel at the same time, multiple occasions.

154
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,370
送我回我车上
Take me back to my car.

155
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,780
-杰姬  听我说  -请掉头
- Jackie, listen... - Turn around now, please.

156
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,660
所以我最近没怎么联系你
It's the reason I haven't been in touch.

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,750
我想保护你...
I wanted to protect you...

158
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,950
-但是她提出了  -我不想谈这个
- but she's making-- - I don't wanna talk about it.

159
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,460
停车  让我下去  或者送我回去
Just stop the car and let me out or drive me back.

160
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,320
我送你回去
I'll take you back.

161
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,500
再一两天
A day or two.

162
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,250
我们没法提前知道  总统先生
We might not have much warning, Mr. President.

163
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,800
肝脏如此接近衰竭
When the liver is this close to failure,

164
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,280
一切都有可能突然发生
things can happen suddenly.

165
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,730
你们应该做好准备
You should be prepared.

166
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,370
-他的手是怎么回事  -那是扑翼样震颤
- What's happening with his hands? - It's called asterixis.

167
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,830
当身体无法排除氨时就会发生这种情况
It happens when the body can't clear ammonia.

168
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,210
谢谢你  撒克逊医生
Thank you, Dr. Saxon.

169
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,260
我不去勃兰登堡了
I'm not going to Brandenburg.

170
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,750
不  你必须去
No, you have to.

171
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,360
-凯茜会代表我谈判  -在这事上我不信任她
- Cathy will negotiate on my behalf. - I don't trust her on this.

172
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,960
我们必须冒这个险
That's a risk we'll have to take.

173
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,960
我不能冒的险  是总统去世时我在海外
The risk I won't take is being overseas if the president dies.

174
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,500
我们都不知道国会
We don't even know if Congress

175
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,460
会不会批准救市计划的拨款
will approve the appropriation for the bailout.

176
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,740
他们会批准的  我会确保他们批准
They will approve it. I'll make sure they do.

177
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,460
你现在不该担心这个  克莱尔
You shouldn't be worrying about this now, Claire.

178
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,630
你应该全心关注弗兰克
You should be focused on Frank.

179
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,950
我们得给他上呼吸机
We need to put him on the ventilator

180
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,020
保护他的呼吸道
to protect his airways.

181
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,540
您该走了  夫人  去休息一下
You should go, ma'am. Go get some rest.

182
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,550
-现在不是时候  莉安  -非常紧急
- Now's not a good time, LeAnn. - This can't wait.

183
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,610
-怎么了  -波利跳
- What is it? - Pollyhop.

184
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,040
-搜索引擎吗  -康威在跟他们合作
- The search engine? - Conway is working with them.

185
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,490
他们可以操纵人们搜索的东西
They can manipulate what people search for.

186
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,770
给了他们巨大优势
It gives them a huge advantage--

187
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,100
等等  慢点  这是什么意思
Wait, slow down. What does this mean?

188
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,930
意思是我们输了
It means that we lose.

189
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,080
康威的名字  他的照片
Conway's name, his image,

190
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,890
他们可以控制人们看到什么  强迫人们看
they can control what people see. They can force-feed it.

191
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,980
即便他们不那么做
Even if they're not doing that,

192
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,910
即便他们只是在追踪用户  也足以打败我们了
even if they're just tracking users, it's enough to beat us.

193
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,400
你知道人们在搜索什么  就知道一切
You know what people are searching for, you know everything,

194
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,510
他们的希望  恐惧
their hopes, their fears,

195
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,620
他们半夜盯着天花板时
what they're thinking about when they're staring at the ceiling

196
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,720
脑袋里在想什么
in the middle of the night.

197
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,800
-谁告诉你的  -我信任的人
- Who told you this? - Someone I trust.

198
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,110
我现在不能处理这件事
I can't deal with this right now.

199
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,620
我们得想点办法  克莱尔  否则大选
We have to do something, Claire, or the election--

200
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,260
莉安  我丈夫刚刚痉挛发作
LeAnn, my husband just had a seizure.

201
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,800
恐怕都不能竞选了
There may not even be an election.

202
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,830
抱歉  我...
I'm sorry. I--

203
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,120
如果弗兰西斯挺过来了  我们到时再处理
If Francis survives, we will deal with this then.

204
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,160
现在  我需要全心关注我眼前的事
Right now, I need to focus on what's right in front of me.

205
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,530
没有任何犯罪行为
There was no criminal wrongdoing.

206
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,360
这我们理解  但为什么要冒险呢
That we can fathom. But why take the chance?

207
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,040
因为保持沉默会让我看上去有罪
Because pleading the Fifth makes it look like I broke the law.

208
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,980
我同意
I agree.

209
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,040
我会说出真相  我会承认
So I'll tell the truth. I'll own it.

210
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,890
是的  你没有跟他见过面
Yes, that you didn't meet with him.

211
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,010
你是说...
Are you suggesting that--

212
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,580
司法部长和希瑟各执一词
It's the Attorney General's word against Heather's.

213
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,000
作为你的律师  我不能参与这个对话
As your lawyer, I can't be part of this conversation.

214
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,790
我们还是能赢得竞选的
We can still win this campaign.

215
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,010
我去大厅等你
I'll be in the lobby.

216
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,690
我会支持你的说法
I'll back you up.

217
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,370
安保人员只看见我和古德温一起
The security detail only saw me and Goodwin together,

218
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,730
没看见你和他
not the two of you.

219
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,460
我要宣誓作证的
This is under oath.

220
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,490
安德伍德的人是想抹黑我们
Underwood's people are trying to smear us.

221
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,750
这场竞选的全部意义
The whole point of this campaign

222
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,660
就是做与安德伍德截然不同的人
was to be the opposite of Underwood.

223
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,270
我以为你想要这个的
I thought you wanted this.

224
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,440
如果要犯法就不行
Not if it means breaking the law.

225
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,920
你觉得换作他  还会有这种犹豫吗
Do you think he'd even be having this conversation?

226
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,960
你是真正在意法律的  希瑟
You actually care about the law, Heather...

227
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,130
所以该由你来做总统
which is why you need to be president.

228
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,450
-安德伍德夫人  -鲍勃  我不知道...
- Mrs. Underwood. - Bob, I didn't realize--

229
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,820
少数党领袖和我正在讨论救市计划
The Leader and I were just discussing the bailout package.

230
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,100
布莱斯总统要我强调一下
President Blythe just wanted me to stress

231
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,780
民主党人当前团结一致的重要性
how important it is that the Democrats stick together right now

232
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,250
弗兰西斯还在...
with Francis being--

233
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,660
不必如此
There's no need.

234
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,510
我刚给议长打了电话  安排紧急投票
I just called the Speaker to schedule an emergency vote.

235
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,740
我相信总统会很满意的
I'm sure the President will be pleased.

236
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,880
-弗兰克怎么样  -他还撑着
- How's Frank? - He's hanging in there.

237
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,570
你一定想快点回医院
I'm sure you wanna get back to the hospital.

238
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,830
但谢谢你亲自前来
But thank you for making the personal visit.

239
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,670
牵挂和祈祷与你同在  克莱尔
Thoughts and prayers, Claire.

240
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,340
谢谢你  鲍勃
Thank you, Bob.

241
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,880
我送你出去
I'll walk you out.

242
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,840
失陪一下  领袖
Excuse me, Leader.

243
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,530
你是来威胁我的
You came here to threaten me.

244
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,170
我们不必不和的  杰姬
We don't need to be at odds, Jackie.

245
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,450
你打算每次遭遇我的反对
Do you plan on hanging this over my head

246
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,390
都拿这个来威胁我吗
every time I try to oppose you?

247
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,810
你自己不小心  可怪不得我
You can't fault me for your sloppiness.

248
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,610
也就是"是"了
That's a "Yes."

249
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,670
只要我们是一边的
As long as we're working together,

250
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,750
你就没什么可担心的
you have nothing to worry about.

251
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,840
总统先生  希望您别过于乐观
Mr. President, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

252
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,130
七国集团的成员们
The members of the G7

253
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,640
已经因为邀请了俄罗斯而不满了
are already ruffled because Russia was invited,

254
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,850
而佩特罗夫可能会利用这个机会
and Petrov may be using this opportunity

255
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,650
在国际社会上给我们难堪
to embarrass us in front of the international community.

256
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,050
什么事
Yes?

257
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,450
-第一夫人来了  先生  -请她进来
- The First Lady is here, sir. - Send her in.

258
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,260
先生  我想先完成我们的讨论
Sir, I would like to finish our briefing--

259
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,080
第一夫人想见我  我可不能让她等着
I'm not gonna keep the First Lady waiting if she wants to see me.

260
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,230
-你听说了吧  -对  博奇几分钟前来电了
- I'm sure you've heard. - Yes, Birch called a few minutes ago.

261
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,100
我想和你一起去勃兰登堡  凯茜
I'd like to join you in Brandenburg, Cathy.

262
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,630
很感谢你愿意出力
Well, I appreciate you wanting to pitch in,

263
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,360
但我真的认为没这必要
but I really don't think that's necessary.

264
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,230
我比任何人都了解这个计划
Well, I know this plan better than anyone.

265
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,060
-总统先生  -机会只有一次
- Mr. President... - There is only one shot at this.

266
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,690
-所有人都在场  -弗兰克呢
- Everyone at the same table. - What about Frank?

267
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,560
我在勃兰登堡能派上用场  在这里就不能了
In Brandenburg, I can be useful. I can't here.

268
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,580
第一夫人不能
The First Lady cannot

269
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,990
代表美国政府进行谈判
negotiate on behalf of the United States government.

270
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,790
谁做代表由你决定  总统先生
The delegation is at your discretion, Mr. President.

271
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,490
有人支持你  或许是好事
It might be good for you to have some support.

272
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,550
她的在场会削弱我作为国务卿的权威
Her presence undermines my authority as Secretary of State.

273
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,980
凯茜  佩特罗夫非常固执  这你相信我
Cathy, Petrov is incredibly stubborn. Trust me, I know.

274
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,930
你为什么不愿意用上所有的资源呢
Why wouldn't you wanna have every asset available to you?

275
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,170
请允许我做这件事  总统先生
Allow me to do this, Mr. President.

276
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,850
-先生  -如果能增加胜算
- Sir-- - If it increases our chances.

277
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,710
会的  我保证
It will, I promise.

278
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,070
那就一起吧  我们把简报过一遍
Then join us. We're going over the briefing now.

279
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,010
你尽力了  弗兰克
You tried, Frank...

280
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,310
这已经比大多数人都强了
which is more than most people ever do.

281
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,300
现在  只剩下我们了
Right now, it's just us.

282
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,400
闭上你的眼睛
Rest your eyes.

283
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,430
我们有用不完的时间
We have all the time in the world.

284
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,740
丹尼  发生什么事了
Danny, what was that?

285
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,090
-丹尼  -没事  妈妈
- Danny? - Nothing, Mom.

286
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,630
把门打开
Open the door.

287
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,890
把门打开
Open the door.

288
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,000
安德伍德夫人  萨克逊医生的电话
Mrs. Underwood? Dr. Saxon is on the line.

289
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,540
失陪一下
Excuse me.

290
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,260
喂
Hello?

291
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,340
晚上好  或者说早上好
Good evening, or good morning.

292
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,330
安德伍德总统正在准备手术
President Underwood is currently being prepped for surgery

293
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,440
接受肝脏移植
to receive a liver transplant.

294
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,590
不出意外的话
Barring any complications,

295
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,240
手术将耗时12到13小时
the surgery is expected to take 12 to 13 hours.

296
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,980
有需要的话我们会向大家更新情况
Uh, we'll update you about the progress if need be,

297
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,010
但在手术结束之前应该不会有什么消息了
but probably nothing more until the operation's completed.

298
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,450
我们可以马上让飞机掉头  夫人
We can turn the plane around right now, ma'am.

299
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,770
你能在他手术结束之前赶回去
You'll be back before he's out of surgery.

300
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,240
我们应该那样做  克莱尔
We should do that, Claire.

301
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,130
峰会我会迟到  但是大家能
I'll be late to the summit, but everyone will--

302
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,340
不  我们马上就到了
No. We're almost there.

303
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,230
-我们继续前进  -说实话  克莱尔
- We keep going. - Honestly, Claire--

304
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,170
-告诉机长保持航线  -是  夫人
- Inform the captain to stay on course. - Yes, ma'am.

305
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,060
请给我接赛斯·格雷森
Connect me with Seth Grayson, please.

306
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,410
他已经进去了
He's already gone in.

307
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,870
第一夫人在去勃兰登堡的路上
The First Lady is currently en route to Brandenburg

308
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,920
手术期间不会回到华盛顿
and will not be in Washington for the surgery.

309
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,580
她会继续按计划
She will continue onto the G7 Summit

310
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,180
在七国峰会中协助杜兰特国务卿
to assist Secretary Durant, as planned.

311
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,000
她让我宣读以下声明
She asked me to read the following statement.

312
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,920
"不调头对我来说是个困难的决定"
"It was a difficult decision for me not to return..."

313
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,250
但我了解我的丈夫  如果他醒着
But I know my husband. If he were conscious...

314
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,750
"他会让我继续前行"
"...he'd tell me to press on..."

315
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,730
因为支持他最好的方式就是为国效力
...that the best way to be at his side is to serve my country.

316
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,230
"而我在德国能比在等候室里发挥更大的作用
"And I can serve it better in Germany than in a waiting room.

317
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,660
如果有紧急情况  我会马上回去"
If there's an emergency, I'll return immediately..."

318
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,230
但我对杰弗逊纪念医院的
...but I have the utmost faith...

319
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,810
"医疗团队有极大的信心"
"...in the medical team at Jefferson Memorial."

320
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,190
我在祈祷手术成功
I'm praying for a successful procedure,

321
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,720
我也请求你们跟我一起为我丈夫
and I ask all of you to join me in praying for my husband,

322
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,360
你们的总统祈祷
your president.

323
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,010
请就坐  邓巴女士
Right over there, Ms. Dunbar.

324
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,870
你的律师会来参加吗
Will your attorneys be joining us?

325
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,070
我已经让我的律师不要来了
I've asked my attorneys not to attend.

326
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,150
我们得说明  为您的利益考虑...
We have to advise you that it's in your best interest--

327
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,070
我很清楚  摩根先生
I'm well aware, Mr. Morgan.

328
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,020
我不是第一次坐上这张桌子了
It's not my first time at this table.

329
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,040
谢谢  周主席  佩特罗夫总统
Thank you, President Zhou. President Petrov?

330
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,170
俄罗斯和中国一样希望参与国际峰会
Russia shares China's desire for inclusion.

331
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,930
我们期待展开有成效的会谈
We are looking forward to productive talks.

332
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,660
同时我们也要对安德伍德总统的手术
And we also want to extend our sincere best wishes

333
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,990
致以最真诚的祝福
for President Underwood's surgery.

334
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,280
我们都非常想念他
He is dearly missed at this meeting.

335
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,850
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

336
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,240
我们可以开始了吗
So, shall we begin?

337
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,630
当务之急是
The most pressing order of business

338
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:43,250
国际货币基金组织以及美国和中国
is the joint IMF, American-Chinese debt relief package

339
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,480
对俄联邦的债务减免计划
to the Russian Federation.

340
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,860
在录吗
We're recording?

341
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,950
邓巴女士  你所作的任何陈述
Ms. Dunbar, any statement you make

342
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,650
都将记入司法部报告  成为公共记录
will be part of the public record as part of the DOJ report.

343
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,120
虽然这段录像只是为了...
Although this video is simply for purposes of...

344
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
你可以把录像传给媒体
You can make the video available to the media.

345
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,950
我没有什么好隐瞒的
I have nothing to hide.

346
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,180
你是要放弃对大众保密的权利吗
So you're waiving your right to keep the video from public view?

347
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
是的
I am.

348
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,980
司法部长说你曾向她施压
The attorney general says you pressured her

349
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,350
要她追查卢卡斯·古德温的说法
to look into Lucas Goodwin's claims--

350
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,470
我读过司法部长的陈词
I've read the attorney general's statement.

351
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,010
我们还得到一份来自一名年轻女性的证词
We also have a deposition from a young woman,

352
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,040
是一名职员  她说古德温
a staffer, who says Goodwin

353
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,730
在3月8日辛辛那提的一场活动中曾假扮志愿者
posed as a volunteer at an event in Cincinnati on March 8th.

354
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,390
你与古德温先生会过面吗
Did you meet with Mr. Goodwin?

355
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,370
我在每场活动上都要与上百人握手
I shake hundreds of people's hands at every event.

356
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,600
如果他去过辛辛那提  我有可能跟他握过手
If he was in Cincinnati, there's a chance I may have shaken his.

357
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,020
但要说我跟他曾单独会面...
But the claim that he and I met one-on-one...

358
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,370
所以你是说你没有见过他吗
So you're saying you didn't meet with him?

359
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,100
我们有电话记录  邓巴女士
We have phone records, Ms. Dunbar.

360
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,680
你的确曾与司法部长通过话
You did speak to the attorney general.

361
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,950
玛莎是我的前任上司和老友
Martha is my former boss and an old friend.

362
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,080
我们经常通话  她为什么要说我...
We speak frequently. Why she would claim that I...

363
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,250
我们要个简单的回答  邓巴女士
We need a simple answer, Ms. Dunbar.

364
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,160
你是否曾与
Did you or did you not

365
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,870
卢卡斯·古德温在辛辛那提私下见面
meet with Lucas Goodwin privately in Cincinnati?

366
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,840
是的
Yes.

367
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,860
我与一名不认识的男人见了面
I met with a man I didn't know

368
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,040
结果发现他精神错乱
who turned out to be unhinged.

369
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,080
我联系司法部长
I contacted the attorney general

370
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,790
是因为她是国内顶尖的执法人员
because she's the top law enforcement official in the country

371
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,130
而且证人保护计划受她管辖
and WITSEC is under her jurisdiction.

372
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,660
我没做错什么
I did nothing wrong.

373
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,850
告诉我们这场会面的性质
Tell us the nature of this meeting.

374
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,160
我要郑重声明
I'd like to say, for the record,

375
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,190
我认为这次面谈是一场政治阴谋
that I think this interview is an act of political sabotage.

376
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,430
其目的就是要通过关联让我看上去有罪
Its goal is to make me look guilty by association,

377
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,550
但表象与事实是两回事
but there are the way things look and the way things actually are.

378
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,930
我调查弗兰克·安德伍德的时候
When I investigated Frank Underwood,

379
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,030
他看上去是清白的  但他并不是
he looked innocent, but he wasn't.

380
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,240
我无法证明  可我知道确实如此
I couldn't prove it, but I knew it to be true.

381
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,990
邓巴女士
Ms. Dunbar...

382
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,330
你们有我跟古德温先生会面的证据
You have proof that I met with Mr. Goodwin.

383
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,670
我已经承认了
I've admitted it.

384
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,840
这只能证明我的诚实
All that proves is that I'm honest,

385
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,660
不像总统那样为了个人利益
unlike a president who would use the Department of Justice

386
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,780
利用司法部去攻击他的对手
to target his political opponent for his own personal gain.

387
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,860
我要提醒你  女士
Let me remind you, ma'am,

388
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,000
总统在这次调查开始前就已陷入昏迷...
the president was unconscious when this investigation began...

389
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,430
不论他是否意识清醒
It doesn't matter whether he was unconscious or not,

390
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,580
不论他是死是活
whether he lives or dies.

391
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,380
为总统效力的人代表的就是他
The president is the people who work for him.

392
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,910
我觉得这事成不了
I don't think this is going to work.

393
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,580
佩特罗夫在会上说得漂亮
Petrov's talking the talk in session,

394
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,040
但却不肯跟我私下见面
but he won't meet with me privately.

395
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,320
中国人已经准备签字了  如果是因为这个
Chinese are ready to sign, if that's the hold-up.

396
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,720
跟中国人无关
It's not the Chinese.

397
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,210
他拒绝跟任何非国家首脑讲话
He refuses to meet with anyone other than a head of state.

398
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,680
那就看看他愿不愿意跟总统夫人见面
Then see if he'll meet with the president's wife.

399
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,910
这不能改变他道德败坏的事实
It doesn't change the fact that he is morally corrupt,

400
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,090
他也败坏了听命于他的机关
and he has corrupted the institutions that report to him.

401
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,140
所以我才要竞选总统
That is why I am running for president,

402
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,920
因为总得有人跟他抗争
because someone needs to fight this.

403
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,710
她不止跟古德温见了面
So not only did she meet with Goodwin,

404
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,760
她还利用调查来攻击
she's using the investigation to attack

405
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,010
这会儿正在手术台上的总统
a president who's on the operating table as we speak.

406
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,730
是啊  她一直为自己辩护
Yeah, the way she keeps defending herself

407
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,360
只会让阴谋论者有更多...
only gives conspiracy theorists more...

408
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,410
她完了
She's done.

409
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,930
我不是说她有参与...
Now, I'm not saying that she was involved...

410
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,280
毫无疑问
Without a doubt.

411
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,430
...但许多人正在社交媒体上...
...but many are taking to social media...

412
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,570
-赛斯  -你好  辛西娅
- Seth. - Hello, Cynthia.

413
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,160
你有没有什么工作给我
Think you might have anything for me?

414
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,240
...尤其总统的支持率还...
...and certainly not a president whose approval rating...

415
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,370
在你们的竞选团队里
On your campaign?

416
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,170
是的  很讽刺
Yeah, it's ironic...

417
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,100
我得挂了  祝你好运
I'm gonna hang up now. Good luck.

418
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,600
但我觉得她是搞砸了
...but I think she may have just tanked it.

419
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,380
总统先生  移植手术完毕
Mr. President... the transplant's complete.

420
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,810
他们正在缝合刀口
Now they're closing him up.

421
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,440
接下来就看他能否适应新器官了
We'll see how he accepts the new organ.

422
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,030
也许我们该给克莱尔打个电话了
Maybe we should try and get Claire on the phone.

423
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,280
嗯
Yeah.

424
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,470
快了  我们在等他
Soon. We're waiting for him now.

425
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,700
好的  好  谢谢  唐纳德
Okay. Okay, thank you, Donald.

426
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,090
-挺顺利喽  -除非他的身体排斥这个肝脏
- So it's going well? - Well, unless his body rejects the liver.

427
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,040
-总统先生  -安德伍德夫人
- Mr. President. - Mrs. Underwood.

428
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,500
总统先生
Mr. President.

429
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,870
我以为我们要单独见面
I thought we were meeting alone.

430
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,780
作为政府的代表
As the administration's representative,

431
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,460
我需要参与到所有谈话中
I need to participate in any conversations--

432
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,350
国务卿女士  我相信我的人说得很清楚了
Madam Secretary, I believe my people were very clear, hmm?

433
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,640
能给我们点时间吗  凯茜
Would you give us a moment, please, Cathy?

434
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,190
一小会儿就好
Just a little while.

435
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,990
我就在外面
I'll be outside.

436
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,780
手术进展怎么样
So... how is surgery going?

437
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,400
目前还好
So far, so good.

438
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,120
你一定累坏了  快坐吧  坐吧
Ah, you must be exhausted. Now, sit. Sit.

439
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,760
你一定更想在医院里吧
I imagine you'd rather be at the hospital.

440
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,220
这事太重要了
Well, this is too important,

441
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,370
你又不肯跟杜兰特国务卿谈判
and you weren't going to negotiate with Secretary Durant.

442
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,860
你凭什么认为我会跟你谈判
What makes you think I'll negotiate with you?

443
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,450
那不是我们坐在这里的原因吗
Oh, well, isn't that why we're sitting here?

444
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,660
也许我只是想...再看到你的脸
Maybe I just wanted to... see your face again.

445
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,630
也许我喜欢你这张脸
Maybe I'm fond of it.

446
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,730
你是个美丽的女人  安德伍德夫人
You are a beautiful woman, Mrs. Underwood, hmm?

447
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,800
那双唇
Those lips...

448
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,970
你能为我说句话吗
Would you say something for me?

449
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,670
你可以说...
Would you say, um...

450
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,500
"你真可耻  总统先生"吗
"Shame on you... Mr. President."

451
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,080
当真吗  维克多  要重提那段不快吗
Really, Viktor? Are we gonna dredge that up?

452
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,800
道个歉就行
An apology would do...

453
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,850
如果你想谈判的话
if you want to negotiate...

454
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,430
如果我道歉  你就不会再尊重我了
Well, you would lose respect for me if I apologized.

455
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,440
没错
Yes.

456
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,030
这倒是
Yes, this is true.

457
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,370
我不是来旅游的  维克多
I'm not here for a sightseeing trip, Viktor.

458
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,580
弗兰西斯需要一个肝脏  我需要救市
So, Francis needs a liver and I need a bailout.

459
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,270
-你需要什么  -我需要你同意那些条款
- What do you need? - I need for you to agree to the terms.

460
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,520
对啊  条款  没错
Oh, yes, the terms. The terms, yes.

461
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,000
但你为什么在这儿  而不是陪着弗兰西斯
But why are you here... and not with Francis?

462
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,840
你母亲生病时  你回到了她身边
When your mother is sick, you go to her.

463
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,300
现在却不在你丈夫身边
Not your husband, hmm?

464
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,160
那些报道是真的吗
Were the stories true?

465
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,400
出问题了吗  克莱尔
Are there problems, Claire?

466
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,920
你对中国的顾虑是什么
What are your concerns with the Chinese?

467
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,560
有太多钻井在敏感地区
There are too many drilling sites in sensitive areas.

468
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,240
对我们是个安全问题
It's a security issue to us.

469
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,090
你们具体担心的是哪几个钻井
And what sites, in particular, are you worried about?

470
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,870
你熟悉各个区域吗
Oh, you... you are familiar with the individual zones?

471
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,360
这是我的计划  我完全清楚
It's my plan. I know it backwards and forwards.

472
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,280
这样啊  怪不得对你这么重要
I see, so that's why it's so important to you.

473
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,990
因为这是你的
Because it's yours.

474
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,260
是这其中之一吗
Is it one of these?

475
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,060
在太平洋海岸上
On the Pacific coast?

476
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,610
您找我  先生
You asked for me, sir?

477
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,570
我想尽快离开这里
I wanna get out of this place as soon as possible.

478
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,660
我会安排的  先生
I'll make sure of it, sir.

479
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,350
克莱尔在哪
Where's Claire?

480
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,860
她在德国
She's in Germany.

481
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,920
德国
Germany?

482
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,450
我很多事要向您汇报  总统先生
A lot to catch you up on, Mr. President.

483
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,400
-雷蒙德  -中国人开始担心了
- Raymond. - The Chinese are getting skittish.

484
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,000
他们想知道为什么这么慢
They wanna know why it's taking so long.

485
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,970
如果佩特罗夫不尽快同意  他们可能会退出
Now, if Petrov doesn't agree soon, they may back out.

486
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,730
-谢谢  雷蒙德  -我随时待命
- Thank you, Raymond. - I'm on standby.

487
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,380
我们得马上达成协议
We need to shake hands on this.

488
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,950
不行  我告诉过你了  库页岛上不能有
No. No, I told you, nothing on Sakhalin Island.

489
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,220
只要南端两个区  你就可以救市了
It's two zones on the southern end. Then you have your bailout.

490
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,240
这样会打开一扇我不想开的门
It opens a door I don't want to open.

491
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,680
他们的要求很合理了  总统先生
They're being more than reasonable, Mr. President.

492
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,650
合理  谁说的
Reasonable? In whose eyes?

493
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,640
你们和中国在掠夺西伯利亚
You and China are raping Siberia.

494
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,960
不是我们把你们的经济搞砸的
We didn't run your economy into the ground.

495
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,940
是你自己
You did.

496
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,950
迈克尔·科里根上吊前
Is this how you tried to convince Michael Corrigan

497
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,070
你就是这么劝他的吗
before he hung himself?

498
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,130
因为你现在就是在要求我这么做
Because that's what you are asking me to do,

499
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,190
在我自己的脖子上系个绳套
to tie the noose around my own neck.

500
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,460
接下来呢  黑海吗  北极吗
What's next? The Black Sea? The Arctic?

501
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,110
我不能允许中国船只
I cannot allow the Chinese ships

502
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,620
这么靠近我的领土
to come this close to my sovereign--

503
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,910
安德伍德夫人  安德伍德总统打来找您
Mrs. Underwood, President Underwood is on the line.

504
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,250
-他醒了吗  -是的  夫人
- He's awake? - Yes, ma'am.

505
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,500
去吧  我们谈完了
Go, go. We're done here.

506
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,720
-我现在没空跟他通话  -安德伍德夫人
- I can't speak with him right now. - Mrs. Underwood--

507
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,840
我有空时会告诉你的
I will let you know when I'm available.

508
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,170
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

509
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,540
你应该跟你丈夫通话
You should talk to your husband.

510
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,560
不达成协议  我不会离开这里的
I'm not leaving here until we have an agreement.

511
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,290
但你是个业余选手  克莱尔
But you're an amateur, Claire.

512
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,000
你飞过来  挺起胸脯
You fly in, you puff up your chest

513
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,090
假装自己是总统
and you pretend to play president.

514
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,240
但没了你丈夫  你又算什么呢
But what would you be without your husband?

515
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,700
什么也不是  只是张漂亮脸蛋
Nothing. A pretty face.

516
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,780
那好吧  你想演总统就演吧
So, yes, play the president if you like.

517
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,660
去吧  告诉中国人他们在太平洋上什么也得不到
Go. Tell the Chinese they get nothing on the Pacific.

518
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,140
你觉得你做得到吗  安德伍德夫人
You think you can do that, Mrs. Underwood?

519
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,310
你的人民正在受苦
Your people are hurting.

520
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,280
最多六个月  他们就会去红场游行
Six months at most, they're gonna be marching on Red Square.

521
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,090
我不想再给你留面子了
I'm done letting you have your dignity.

522
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,280
事实上  你就是个跪着的乞丐
The truth is you're a beggar on your knees,

523
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,230
我们逼你吃什么  你就得吃什么
and you will take whatever we shove down your throat.

524
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,960
维克多
Viktor.

525
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,550
接受协议  挽回面子
Take the deal. Get your dignity back.

526
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,230
国务卿女士
Madam Secretary.

527
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,100
61和67区联合控制权
Joint control of zones 61 and 67.

528
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,200
我们已取得协议  只等总统同意 
We've got an agreement, pending the president's approval.

529
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,610
他在睡觉了
Well, he's sleeping now.

530
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,550
他们即将把他转移回白宫
They're moving him back to the White House soon.

531
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,300
-他看起来怎么样  -我只简单跟他聊了几句
- And how did he seem? - I only talked to him briefly,

532
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,980
但是医生说器官...目前情况良好
but the doctors say the organ is... taking well so far.

533
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,480
他们估计很快能恢复
They're expecting a quick recovery.

534
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,610
你做得非常好  总统先生
You've done an outstanding job, Mr. President.

535
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,570
-你也是  克莱尔  -我要去休息一会儿了
- So have you, Claire. - I'm going to try and get some rest.

536
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,650
当然  一路平安
Of course. Have a safe flight.

537
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,490
专家原本对本次峰会
Experts were pessimistic that

538
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,910
能否取得实质性成果并不乐观
anything meaningful could come out of the summit.

539
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,460
议长办公室送来的预算案草案
Draft of the appropriations bill from the Speaker's office.

540
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,680
请放在桌子上吧
Just put it on the desk, please.

541
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,230
凯瑟琳·杜兰特在勃兰登堡如是说
...Catherine Durant had this to say from Brandenburg.

542
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,150
佩特罗夫总统和我与中国政府
President Petrov and I worked through the night

543
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,310
通宵协商
in concert with the Chinese government

544
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,390
以达成协议
in order to come up with an agreement.

545
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,410
连同私营企业一起
Along with partners in the private sector,

546
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,260
美国  中国和俄罗斯将进行合作
the United States, China, and Russia will collaborate on a plan

547
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,660
在东西伯利亚未开发地区开采石油
to extract oil from untapped sites in eastern Siberia.

548
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,690
这将使石油市场和全球经济
This will then enable a return to a more stable oil market,

549
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,120
重归稳定
as well as a stable global economy.

550
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,540
为使这项计划可行
Now, in order to make this plan viable

551
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,920
并减轻美国和
and mitigate any tax burden...

552
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,440
中国纳税人的税收负担
...to the American and Chinese taxpayers,

553
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,240
私营公司将提供大部分投资
the corporations will provide the bulk of the investment,

554
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,520
以及开采石油的基础设施和技术
the, uh, infrastructure to extract the oil and the technology.

555
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,410
所得利润
and then any of the profits

556
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,020
也将在这些公司之间
will then be distributed commensurately among

557
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,100
对应分配
these corporations, as well,

558
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,230
还包括俄罗斯政府投资的土地价值
and including the land value invested by the Russian government.

559
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,120
现在  我愿意接受任何提问
So at this time, I'd like to open the floor to any questions.

560
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,860
有很多人问我第一夫人扮演了什么角色
I'm getting a lot of questions about the First Lady's involvement.

561
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,520
我们就坚持说  她只是过去协助
We stick to our message that she was just there to assist.

562
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,040
杜兰特国务卿才是主导
Secretary Durant led the effort.

563
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,660
有很多报道说她和佩特罗夫开了很长的会
There's multiple reports that she and Petrov had a long meeting.

564
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,160
他们不过是互相问候  就这样
They greeted each other. That's it.

565
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,650
那我们否认吗
So we deny?

566
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,460
总统还未批准这个方案
The President hasn't approved the plan yet.

567
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,660
我们要关注他的康复  而不是...
We wanna focus on his recovery, not the-

568
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,770
-什么事  -卫生部长找您  先生
- Yes? - Secretary of Health for you, sir.

569
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,530
我回头去你办公室找你
I'll find you in your office.

570
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,230
部长女士
Madam Secretary.

571
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,210
-我刚给你发了邮件  -稍等
- I just sent you an email. - Hold on.

572
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,430
这是什么
What is this?

573
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,330
看见照片上的父亲了吧
The father you see there?

574
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,390
那就是我们为总统挤下去的人
That's who we bumped for the President.

575
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,000
他一小时前去世了
He died an hour ago.

576
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,280
留下两个孩子和他深爱的妻子
Father of two, loving husband.

577
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,270
马上从你的发件箱删除
Delete it right now from your outbox.

578
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,550
已经删了  但我想让你看到他的脸
I already did, but I wanted you to see his face...

579
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,710
和他留下的亲人
the family he left behind.

580
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,670
可能需要几天时间  但我...
Well, uh, it will probably take a few days, but, uh, I'm--

581
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,850
我太太起来了

巴黎遭到大规模恐怖袭击
在反恐的共同目标下  美国和俄罗斯的合作有升温的迹象
以美国国务卿克里为代表的美方官员
多次就反恐和叙利亚问题同俄方代表会谈
虽然会谈气氛远谈不上友好  但也非剑拔弩张
双方都希望在反恐方面有些建设性的合作

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}但整体上  俄罗斯仍然处于强势地位
出兵叙利亚后  他们一边打击伊斯兰国
但更多时间也在打击美方支持的反政府武装
俄军战机每天呼啸而过
美军不得不将地面特种部队的战略位置告之俄军  以免遭误伤
过去一年中  奥巴马不止一次在国际会议上同普京碰面
双方有过几次面对面的会谈
但从媒体报道及新闻图片上很容易看出  两人关系仍然十分紧张
