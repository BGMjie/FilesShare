一个双安德伍德式的白宫会是什么样
what would an Underwood-Underwood White House look like?

It's not enough. Conway's hitting way more states than we are.

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,970
他又不是在任总统  比你有更多时间
Well, he's not a sitting president. He has more time than you do.

50
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,440
那我们就得挤出更多时间
Well, then we have to make more time.

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,870
我们必须到各地去  我们必须动...
We have to get out there. We've got to shake--

-我没事  -坐一会儿吧
- I'm fine. - Sit down for a moment.

54
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,940
不不  我没事  我没事  我们继续
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's continue.

55
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,880

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,170
怎么样
So?

59
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,060
我同意撒克逊医生和医疗团队的建议
I agree with Dr. Saxon and the medical team.

60
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,420
我们得把飞行次数减到一周一次
We should reduce air travel to once a week.

61
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,850
恐怕那不可能
I'm afraid that's not possible.

62
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,530
您想听其他人的建议  先生  这就是
You wanted a second opinion, sir. You have it.

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,330
我不是想听别人的建议  我是想听不同的建议
I didn't want a second opinion. I wanted a different opinion.

64
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,510
飞机对您有伤害
Planes take a toll.

65
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,710

We're concerned about a sudden organ rejection.

66
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,500
如果我不四处跑  我就无法赢得选举
I can't win an election if I can't travel.

67
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,680

You can't win if you're hospitalized.

68
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,350

Thank you, Doctor.

69
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,960
你留下来  康威去哪我就去哪  我会..
You stay here. I'll go wherever Conway goes, I'll just--

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,230
是我竞选总统  我必须亲自去
I'm on the top of the ticket. It has to be me.

71
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,760
我们不能无视医生的建议  弗兰西斯
We can't ignore the doctors, Francis.

72
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,540
宣传是关键
It's the story we tell.

73
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,330
如果我留在这里  而康威到处奔走
If I stay here, Conway prances around the country,

74
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,870
标榜他的战斗机飞行员形象  与此同时
playing up his fighter-pilot image, and meanwhile,

75
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,930
-我却困在玫瑰园里  -我不能冒险失去你
- I'm stuck here in the Rose Garden-- - I won't risk losing you.

76
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,240
我们得明智点
Let's be smart about this.

77
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,050
-我得表现出力量  -那就去表现
- I need to project strength. - So project it.

78
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,660
空袭正在起效  先生
The air strikes are working, sir.

79
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,960
我们已经阻止了哈里发国进入幼发拉底河
We've stopped ICO's advance to the Euphrates.

80
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,780
只是延缓了进军  没有阻止
We've delayed the advance. We haven't stopped it.

81
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,030
你们的报告说他们在重新集结
Your own reports say they're regrouping.

82
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,960
我需要一次决定性打击
I want a decisive blow,

83

84

艾哈迈迪兄弟躲起来了
Uh, the Ahmadi brothers are in hiding.

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,910
我们不知道他们的藏身之处
We don't know their location.

86
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,070
你们的任务就是找到他们
Well, your task is to find them.

87
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,060
我们努力了  先生
We've tried, sir.

88
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,660
我们的特工毫无进展
Our assets hit a wall.

89
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,220
要彻底铲除就得排遣特种部队去那里
To root them out would require special forces on the ground.

90
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,370
这也不是不可以
That is a step I am willing to take.

91
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,520
我们没有叙利亚的授权
We don't have authorization from the Syrians.

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,500
国务卿杜兰特会摆平这件事
Secretary Durant will smooth that out.

93
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,660
我不会满足于
I will not be satisfied

94
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,180
阻挡毒蛇的去路  先生们
by blocking the serpent's path, gentlemen.

95
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,800
我要砍掉它该死的脑袋
I wanna cut off its goddamn head.

96
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,180
叙利亚人会拒绝  到那时
The Syrians will say no, and when they do,

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,540
看看他们是否愿跟俄罗斯特种部队合作
see if they'll work with the Russian special forces.

98
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,980
脏活让俄罗斯人去干  我们坐收功劳
The Russians do the dirty work, we take all the credit.

99
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,220
佩特罗夫不会同意的
Petrov won't go for that.

100
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,440
还给他们几个钻井就会答应了
Well, he will if we give him back some of our drilling zones.

101
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,370
那需要国会的批准
Well, that'll take congressional approval.

102
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,220
道格正为此做准备
Doug's laying the groundwork now.

103
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,810
关于这件事你想听听我的意见
Are you interested in my opinion on this,

104
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,570
还是已经做好了决定
or has it already been decided?

105
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,500
我想迅速行动  
I want to move fast,

106
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,020
所以除非你有更迅速的办法
so unless you have a quicker option,

107
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,360
不然最好还是保留观点吧
it's probably best you keep it to yourself.

108
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,770
-是  先生  -凯茜
- Yes, sir. - Cathy.

109
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,870
有什么问题吗
Do we have a problem?

110
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,420
没有  先生  我去和道格协调
No, sir. I'll coordinate with Doug.

111
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,730
被狗咬了以后  要么就把它干掉
After a dog's bitten you, you either put it to sleep,

112
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,170
要么就给它带上口套
or you put a muzzle on it.

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,060
我暂时选择...口套
I've chosen a muzzle... for now.

114
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,370
来的路上我一直在考虑
I was, uh, thinking on the way over here

115
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,550
我不想每次活动都发表同一篇讲话
that I don't wanna do the same speech at every event.

116
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,400
我认为如果每次讲话内容都不同
I really think we'll get more news coverage

117
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,100
能获得更多的媒体关注
if I have a different speech every time.

118
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,270
莉安已经告诉我了
LeAnn already told me.

119
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,330
我做了一些修改
I've been working on some variations.

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,030
我觉得我们还得
I think, uh, we also need to

121
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,870
随时对康威的言论作出回应
respond to what Conway is saying...at all times.

122
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,460
开始对他施加压力
Start putting pressure on him.

123
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,260
赛斯的手下会把笔录发给我
Seth's office is sending me transcripts.

124
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,380

There was an interview query from Time,

125
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,710
一条什么纪念基金的语音留言
a voicemail about some memorial fund.

126
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,960
豪斯顿参议员来电确认周二会面的事
Senator Halston called about the meeting on Tuesday.

127
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,040
等等  那条语音留言
Wait. The voicemail.

128

130
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,640
-你之前好像...捐赠过  -帮我调出来
- I guess you... donated? - Cue that up for me.

131
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,800
按1号键就能听了
Just press one when you're ready.

132
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,100
-过会儿再向我汇报  -好的
- I'll catch up with you in a little bit. - Okay.

133
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,630
您好  我是劳拉·莫雷蒂
Hi, this is Laura Moretti

我想亲自跟您联系
I just, uh... I wanted to reach out to you personally,

136
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,280
对您的慷慨捐赠表示感谢
to say thank you for the incredibly generous donation.

137
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,720
这是我们收到的最大一笔捐款
It's the biggest donation we've received.

138
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,230
远超其他人
By a lot.

139
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,360
我不知道您是如何知道我们的
Uh, I don't know how you found out about us.

140
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,720
也许是因为总统的移植手术
Maybe because of the President's transplant.

141
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,510
但不论出于何种原因
But whatever the reason,

142
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,260
这对我和孩子们意义非凡
it means so much to us, to me and my children.

143
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,930
不论如何  我知道希望不大
Anyway, I... and I know this is a long shot,

144
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,420
但如果你有空一起喝杯咖啡的话
but if you're ever free for coffee,

145
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,370
我想当面谢谢您
I'd love to thank you in person.

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,040
没空...也没关系

再次感谢您  斯坦普先生

我想亲自跟您联系

对您的慷慨捐赠表示感谢
to say thank you for the incredibly generous donation.

152

这是我们收到的最大一笔捐款
It's the biggest donation we've received.

153
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,840
把稿子放到提词器上还来得及吗
Will there be enough time to get this up on the teleprompter?

154
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,970
主要是做了删减
They're mostly cuts.

155
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,600
应该会很快  我这就去
Should be quick. I'll get it there now.

156
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,460
你改了什么
What did you change?

157
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,860
我删去了有关爱的那一段
I took out the paragraph about love.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,660
-那是最精彩的部分  -太软弱了
- That's the best part. - It was too soft.

159
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,800
这儿曾经是家烧烤店
This used to be a barbecue joint, here.

160
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,670
弗兰克当总统前经常光顾
Frank came a lot before he was president.

161
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,030
怎么会变成这样
What happened to it?

162
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,640
弗兰克碰过的东西都是这下场
Same thing that happens to everything Frank touches.

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,910
-你介意吗  -介意
- You mind? - I do mind.

164
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,240
我还没答应什么
I haven't agreed to anything yet.

165
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,330
告诉我你知道的事
Tell me what you know.

166
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,220
我知道安德伍德在洗钱的事上撒谎了
I know Underwood lied about the money laundering.

167
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,200
我知道他见了拉尼根  虽然他否认了
I know he met with Lanagin when he said he didn't.

168
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,350
我知道艾德华·密查姆改动了出行记录
I know Edward Meechum doctored travel records,

169
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,210
我还知道那一切你都参与了
and I know you were there for all of it.

170
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,800
然后塔斯克获得赦免  你当上幕僚长
Then Tusk gets a pardon. You get Chief of Staff.

171
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,140
-明日黄花  -你为什么辞职
- Old news. - Why'd you quit the job?

172
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,240
我想回到私营企业
I wanted to go back in the private sector.

173
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,750
你才说过安德伍德碰过的东西都会被毁灭
You just said everything Underwood touches gets demolished.

174
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,470
我不喜欢他  那又怎么样
I don't like the man. So what?

175
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,910
那你为什么在俄罗斯协议上又跟他合作
Why'd you team up with him again for the Russia deal?

176
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,520
我不需要喜欢一起做事的人
I don't have to like the people I work with.

177
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,150
而且  可以狠赚一笔
Plus, there was a fortune to be made.

178
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,270
问题是
See...

179
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,130
我认为你根本不在乎那个钱
I don't think you give a damn about the money.

180
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,000
这里面有其他事  你是不肯承认
There's a lot more to this you're not admitting.

181
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,730
但我认为你想承认
But I think you want to.

182
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,040
那么  你其实没有任何实在的东西
So, truth is, you don't have anything solid.

183
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,680
我会把这事查个水落石出
I will get to the bottom of this story.

184
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,660
我们可以现在谈  或者你可以回头雇一堆律师
We can talk now, or you can wait till you have a team of lawyers

185
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,760
来跟我的事实核查员聊
talking to my fact checkers.

186
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,440
我曾被亿万富翁和总统威胁过
I've been threatened by billionaires and by presidents.

187
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,080
你以为一个失业记者能让我紧张吗
You think an out-of-work reporter makes me nervous?

188
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,490
我现在就可以给白宫打电话
I can call the White House right now,

189
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,060
让他们知道你在调查这件事
let 'em know you're working on this story.

190
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,160
我约你就冒了这个险
That's a gamble I took asking to meet.

191
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,020
但是我赌
But my chips...

192
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,980
你好的一面占上风
are on the better part of you prevailing.

193
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,520
谁  做了什么  为什么  怎么做
The who... the what... the why, how...

194
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,620
别忽略了在哪里做
Don't ignore where.

195
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,190
我觉得转一下会比较好
I think it'd be better if I turn it.

196
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,060
我觉得这一面稍微好点
I think... I think this side is a little better.

197
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,560
-是的  非常漂亮  -弗莱迪
- Yes, that's very nice. - Freddy.

198
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,120
-下午好  总统先生  -下午好
- Good afternoon, Mr. President. - Good afternoon.

199
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,190
海伦在教我做事呢
Helen is teaching me the ropes.

200
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,600
我们不打扰您了  先生
We'll leave you be, sir.

201
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,830
弗莱迪
Oh, Freddy?

202
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,540
你留一下吧  非常感谢
Why don't you stay back for a little bit? Thank you very much.

203
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,470
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

204
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,360
好久不见
It's been a while.

205
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,560
他们  几个月前把我调去了花房
Well, they, uh... moved me to the flower shop a few months ago.

206
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
在地下室
The basement.

207
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,650
所以你没怎么见到我
That's probably why you haven't seen me around.

208
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,270
我绝对想不到  居然会喜欢做这个
Never would've guessed that, well, that this would be my thing.

209
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,930
看来老家伙还是能学点新把戏的
I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks.

210
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,020
-你孙子还好吗  -他很好  很好
- How's your grandson? - He's good, good.

211
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,460
刚开始重新上学
Just started school again.

212
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,860
-他读几年级了  -六年级
- What grade is he in now? - Sixth grade.

213
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,860
慢慢长大了
Getting up there.

214
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,120
我真的得走了
I... I really should go.

215
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,930
有一大批秋季的花要送过来
We got a big, uh, shipment of autumn blooms in.

216
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,230
那下次再聊吧
Well, then another time, I guess, maybe.

217
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,420
弗兰克
You know, Frank...

218
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,590
我很快就要走了
I'm gonna be leaving soon.

219
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,510
海伦的丈夫在乔治敦开了一家花店
Helen's husband opened up a flower shop in Georgetown.

220
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,170
他们想要我过去工作
They want me to work there.

221
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,750
你在这里不开心吗  弗莱迪
Well, are you not happy here, Freddy?

222
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,130
该尝试点新东西了
Time to try something new.

223
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,180
我能做点什么说服你留下来吗
Well, is there anything I can do to convince you to stay?

224
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,020
加薪  调整工作时间
A raise? Better hours?

225
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,580
我很感激  但是我已经答应海伦了
I appreciate it, but I've already told Helen yes, and...

226
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,070
而我打算说到做到  那是我想做的
I plan on keeping my word on that. It's what I want.

227
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,760
我会想念你的  弗莱德
Well, I'm gonna miss you around, Freddy.

228
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,590
这里没几个人
There's not many people here...

229
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,620
这里没几个人
Well, I guess there aren't that many people here

230
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,050
能让我觉得那么自在
I'm all that comfortable with.

231
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,580
你知道你走之前应该做什么吗
You know what you should do before you go?

232
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,540
你应该哪天晚上上来给我们做一顿肋排
You should come up here one night and cook us a rack of ribs.

233
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,920
我知道烤箱烤的肯定不如碳烤
Now, I realize oven-baked isn't nearly as good as the smoker,

234
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,480
但你怎么样都能做得很美味
but you'd make 'em delicious, anyhow.

235
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,280
肋排  是吗
Ribs? Really?

236
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,850
你想让我给你做肋排吃
You want me to cook ribs for you.

237
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,120
对  就像以前那样  有什么不对吗
Well, sure, just like old times. What's wrong with that?

238
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,710
我只是仆人  对不对
I'm just the help, ain't I?

239
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
-不  不是这样的  -我告诉你我遇见了好事
- No, that's not true. - I tell you I got something good going,

240
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,370
而你的第一反应不是
and your first thought ain't,

241
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,960
"弗莱迪  恭喜"
"Freddy, congratulations."

242
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,760
而是"给我做肋排"  对我的盛大欢送
It's "Make me ribs." And what's my big send-off?

243
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,250
-就是给你做肋排  -不
- I get to cook you ribs. - No.

244
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,820
你对这事太过敏感了
Look, you are being way oversensitive about this.

245
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,080
你误解了我的意思
You're misinterpreting what I meant.

246
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,960
你说得对
You're right.

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,440
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

248
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,090
-真不知克莱尔是怎么做到的  -你说什么
- I don't know how Claire does it. - What did you just say?

249
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,290
你也这么对她吗  她也是收藏品之一
Is this how you treat her? She part of the collection, too?

250
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,860
我不知道你这怨气从何而来
I don't know where all this is coming from,

251
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,530
但也太忘恩负义了
but it's extremely ungrateful,

252
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,770
想想我为你做了那么多
given all that I have done for you.

253
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,320
你为我做了什么  弗兰克
What did you do for me, Frank?

254
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,690
这里是白宫
This is the White House.

255
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,000
你得叫我"总统先生"
You will call me "Mr. President"!

256
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,960
你就是个王八犊子
You're a motherfucker!

257
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,310
滚
Get out!

258
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,910
我的错  我的错
My bad, my bad.

259
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,290
你是个王八犊子  总统先生
You're a motherfucker, Mr. President!

260
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,160
康威州长一直声称
Governor Conway continues to say

261
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,090
我们在反恐上做得还不够
we're not doing enough about terrorism,

262
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,810
但他忽视了哈里发国已得到遏制的事实
but he ignores the fact that ICO has been stopped in its tracks.

263
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,160
总统不眠不休地与国外敌人作斗争
The president is working tirelessly to combat our enemies abroad,

264
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,040
康威州长的言论
and what Governor Conway lacks in his assessment...

265
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,860
忽略了总统数十年的经验...
is the decades of experience the president brings...

266
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,780
你还应该继续叫他"总统"吗
Do you think you should keep calling him "The president"?

267
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,240
我想强调我们是竞选搭档
Well, I wanna emphasize that we're running mates,

268
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,290
而且莉安告诉我  婚姻角度并不成功
and LeAnn is telling me that the marriage angle isn't working.

269
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,060
别管什么调查
Screw the research.

270
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,980
人们想听见真正的你  有血有肉的人
People want to hear the real you, a real person.

271
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,860
你在党代会上向他们展示的就是真正的你
That's what you gave them at the convention.

272
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,110
抱歉
Sorry.

273
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,030
那情况完全不同
That was very different.

274
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,020
没错  的确不同  那时你是诚恳的
Exactly. It was very different. It was honest.

275
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,620
你不能只机械地回应他的话
And you don't want to just react to what he's saying.

276
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,070
你得拿出点东西来
You wanna offer something.

277
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,870
我跟弗兰西斯一起竞选了三十年
I have been campaigning with Francis for 30 years.

278
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,560
不能让对手骑在你头上
You don't ever let the opponent walk all over you.

279
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,620
如果受到攻击  就得还击
If you're getting attacked, you fight back.

280
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,590
可以  但用另一种方式还击
Fine, but fight back in a different way.

281
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,760
这个人...他都是搞噱头  很肤浅
This guy is... He's all spotlight and surface,

282
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,840
上杂志封面  玩推特  别玩他的游戏
and magazine covers and Twitter. Don't play his game.

283
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,150
压根就别玩  摆脱游戏
Don't play the game at all, please. Get beyond the game.

284
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,870
我们早上再继续做吧
You know what? Let's finish this in the morning, please.

285
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,090
抱歉  你说得对
I'm sorry. You're right.

286
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,820
关于这种事你的经验比我多得多
You have a lot more experience in this kind of thing than I do.

287
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,450
-我应该听你的  -不  我尊重你的反馈
- I should follow your lead. - No, I... I respect your feedback.

288
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,800
感谢你能表现得如此专业
Thank you for being so professional about everything.

289
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,290
-你真体贴  -不是体贴
- You've been very kind. - I'm not kind.

290
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,620
现实而已
Just realistic.

291
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,050
你写的关于爱的那段让我不舒服
That paragraph you wrote about love, it made me uncomfortable.

292
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,740
-说你爱弗兰西斯  -我确实爱他
- Saying you love Francis? - I do love him.

293
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,510
那是什么让你不舒服
Then what made you uncomfortable?

294
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,880
在你面前说出来
Saying it in front of you.

295
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,690
-好吗  -好
- Yes? - Yeah.

296
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,860
-她怎么样  -效果甚微
- How'd she do? - Very little effect.

297
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,050
-新闻上铺天盖地全是她  -白噪音
- She was all over the news. - White noise.

298
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,780
我们怎么深入人心
So how do we make it stick?

299
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,910
我能做的不多
Well, there's not much I can do.

300
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,840
我们给你权限了  我要得到更多结果
We gave you access. I need more than I'm getting.

301
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,180
你应该告诉我人们想要什么
You're supposed to tell me what people want.

302
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,720
人们不知道自己想听爵士
People didn't know they wanted jazz

303
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,610
直到他们第一次听到了爵士乐
until they heard it for the first time.

304
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,100
我能让他们喜欢音乐  但我不能创作音乐
I can get them to like the music. I can't compose it.

305
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,190
你得给我点材料
Give me something I can work with.

306
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,380
我们可以把这事公诸于众吗
Is this something we could take public?

307
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,160
不  这是机密
No, it's classified.

308
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,820
但这太完美了  总统跟俄罗斯人勾结
But it's perfect, the president colluding with the Russians.

309
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,440
这个想法是可行的
The idea has merit.

310
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,110
俄罗斯人门路更广
The Russians will have far more access,

311
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,100
而且也不会置美国军队于危险之中
and it doesn't put American troops in harm's way.

312
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,560
褒奖总统的政策不会让我们得到选票
We don't get votes by praising the president's policy.

313
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,800
让德雷尔在委员会审议中否决它
Let's have Dreyer block it in committee.

314
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,800
虽然我不喜欢总统最初处理哈里发国的方式
I don't like the way the president's handled ICO from the get-go,

315
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,620
但他这次的方法也许会有效
but his approach might work here.

316
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,300
那正是我要防止的
That's what I'm trying to prevent.

317
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
你想留哈里发国的领袖一命
So, you wanna keep the ICO leadership alive,

318
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,460
就为了我们能继续拿这个说事
so we can stay on message?

319
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,250
只是拖到11月而已
Just until November,

320
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,600
等我们就职后就狠狠打击他们
and then we'll hit 'em hard after inauguration.

321
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,020
我当初正是为这种扯淡事才辞职
This is the exact sort of BS I resigned over in the first place.

322
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,550
在那边等我一下
I'll see you over there.

323
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,850
再有两个月我们就能获胜
Two months away from winning this thing.

324
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,910
一旦他获得主动权  一旦他获得一点势头
But if he gains the initiative, if he picks up any momentum,

325
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,600
都可能影响我们的胜算
that could put us in the margin of error.

326
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,990
我以为你不一样
I thought you were different.

327
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,030
别胡思乱想  将军
Don't get any ideas, General.

328
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,160
你登上我这艘船
You threw caution into the wind

329
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,830
就已把谨慎抛到九霄云外
when you got yourself on my ticket.

330
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,770
你再做一次  就显得愚蠢了
You do it again, you start to look foolish.

331
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,900
你去跟德雷尔谈谈  让他毙掉这项议案
You talk to Dreyer and 86 this bill.

332
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,750
来到威斯康星州怎能不来尝尝鲜
I couldn't come to Wisconsin without having a taste test.

333
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,240
海耶斯先生  我叫汤姆·汉默施密特
Mr. Hayes. My name's Tom Hammerschmidt.

334
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,800
我是一个自由记者
I'm a freelance reporter.

335
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,320
我想跟你谈谈
I was hoping I could talk to you for a moment.

336
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,190
我不跟记者谈
I don't talk to reporters.

337
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,840
是关于总统的事
It's a story about the president.

338
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,950
你没听到我说什么吗
Did you not hear me the first time?

339
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,480
我认为在你的烧烤店里...曾发生过一些事
I think things happened... in your barbecue place.

340
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,240
会面
Meetings.

341
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,670
你可能顺耳听到过什么
Things you might have overheard.

342
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,250
我觉得总统触犯了法律
I think the president broke the law,

343
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,990
而且我觉得你知情
and I think you know about it.

344
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,000
跟我来  找个没人能听到的地方再聊
Come with me. Let's talk where no one can hear us.

345
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,450
-你带录音笔了吗  -带了
- So, uh, you bring a recorder? - Yeah.

346
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,240
好  我告诉你真相
All right. Here's the truth.

347
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,990
我不再为他工作了  我不再为他烤排骨了
I don't work for him no more. I don't serve him ribs no more.

348
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,660
我不想再跟他有任何关系
I don't want nothing to do with him no more.

349
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,700
即使我恨他  我也的确恨他
Even if I hated him, and I do hate him...

350
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,670
我也不会告密  对警察  对记者
I don't snitch. Not to cops, not to reporters.

351
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,060
对谁都不会
Not to anybody.

352
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,120
离我远点
Leave me the fuck alone.

353
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,070
好了
Okay.

354
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,620
林肯和罗斯福都是共和党的先进分子
Lincoln and Roosevelt were progressive Republicans.

355
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,630
-杰弗逊是一名有远见的保守党  -是的
- Jefferson was a visionary Conservative. - Yeah!

356
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,640
乔治·华盛顿是位强大的领袖
George Washington was a strong commander in chief.

357
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,530
威廉·康威拥有所有这些品质
William Conway embodies all these qualities.

358
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,010
我为背书他竞选总统而骄傲
I proudly endorse his candidacy for president,

359
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,940
我也希望我们州的每个人都这么做
and I ask everyone in our great state to do the same.

360
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,650
欢迎未来的美国总统  威廉·康威
The next President of the United States, William Conway!

361
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,780
你们的支持让我受宠若惊
I'm... I'm humbled by your endorsement,

362
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,610
我身后这些伟人遗留的贡献也让我自愧不如
and by the legacy of these great men behind me.

363
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,830
接任他们是一项艰巨的任务
Now, they all left very big shoes to fill.

364
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,200
知道谁完全没有接任的资格吗
You know who hasn't come even close to filling them?

365
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,650
弗兰克·安德伍德
Frank Underwood.

366
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,920
我该离开
I should go.

367
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,990
我们降落之后
Once we land.

368
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,460
我就飞回东海岸
I'll get a flight back to the East Coast.

369
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,040
-汤姆...  -你不用多说了
- Tom... - You don't have to say anything.

370
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,760
有人向房子扔鸡蛋
We've had eggs thrown at the house.

371
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,190
番茄  牛粪  什么都有
Tomatoes, cow dung. You name it.

372
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,880
南达科他州十分支持康威
South Dakota's big Conway country.

373
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,720
我们一生都住在这儿  也在这儿养育后代
We've been here all our lives. We raised our son here.

374
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,680
从未遇到过这种情况
It's just beyond our experience.

375
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,400
这些人都是我们的邻居
All these folks are our neighbors.

376
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,870
可我一把标志竖起来
But once I put that sign up...

377
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,820
康威州长是退伍军人  而且有孩子
Governor Conway is a veteran. He has children.

378
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,840
为什么选我们  而不是他
Why us and not him?

379
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,290
当我们看到你们两个在党代会
When we saw you two at the convention...

380
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,060
我说不清  看上去真像对儿好搭档
I don't know. It just seemed like a real partnership.

381
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,490
爱  深沉  坚定的爱
Love. Deep, unwavering love.

382
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,330
感谢你们提醒我
I wanna thank you for reminding me

383
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,650
那种爱有多重要
how important that kind of love is.

384
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,510
它真的很重要  我们容易忙于竞选
Because it is. It's easy to get caught up in the campaign

385
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,560
而忘记弗兰西斯和我是怎样走到这一步的
and to forget how Francis and I got here in the first place,

386
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,430
记得我们不仅是总统和第一夫人
to remember that we're not just President and First Lady,

387
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,900
或丈夫和妻子
or husband and wife.

388
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:13,860
我们是搭档
We're partners.

389
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,110
我们决定要一起解决所有事
We have made a choice to tackle everything together.

390
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,890
我们超越了美丽和完美
We go beyond what's pretty and perfect,

391
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,680
超越了恐惧  困难和未知
beyond what's scary, difficult and unknown.

392
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,920
我们不仅是候选人名单上的搭档
We're not just partners on the ticket.

393
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,200
我们也是生活中的搭档
We're partners in life.

394
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,420
总统先生
Mr. President.

395
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,960
众议院情报委员会里
You have someone on the inside of

396
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,210
有人给你
the House Intelligence Committee

397
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,740
提供机密信息
feeding you classified information.

398
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,700
我是在任州长
I'm a sitting governor.

399
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,630
获得信息没什么错
There's nothing wrong with staying informed.

400
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,650
所有共和党人都在反对俄罗斯的介入
Every Republican is against the Russians being involved.

401
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,170
你是在干预国家安全
You are interfering with national security.

402
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,800
我没摆布任何人
I haven't influenced a single member.

403
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,290
那是因为你让布洛哈特这么做
Oh, that's because you're having Brockhart do it.

404
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,120
如果将军提供专业建议
If the general chooses to share his expertise with them,

405
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,550
他们当然愿意听
they're well served by it.

406
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,190
你每天要说50次我们得摧毁哈里发国
Fifty times a day, you say we should destroy ICO,

407
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,690
现在又故意阻止我们那么做
and now you're deliberately preventing us from doing it.

408
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,250
你6个月前就可以摧毁他们了
You could've destroyed them six months ago,

409
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,600
所以不要把这赖在我...
so don't lay that at my...

410
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,290
我不怪你装相  州长
I don't blame you for being a fraud, Governor.

411
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,750
我们都偶尔要伪善一下
I mean, we all have to be hypocrites, every now and then.

412
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,970
但如果你阻止  我就得派美国军队
But if you block this, I'll send American troops in instead.

413
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,510
你不会派美国人过去的  叙利亚不会同意的
You won't send Americans. Syria won't allow it.

414
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,290
我不在乎叙利亚会不会同意
I don't care what Syria will allow.

415
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,600
但你难道不希望让俄罗斯人去冒险
But wouldn't you rather have it be Russians in harm's way,

416
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,170
而不是美国同胞士兵吗
than your fellow American soldiers?

417
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,540
如果有人牺牲  那将是你一手造成的
If anyone gets killed, that's going to be blood on your hands.

418
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,760
你想让我叫共和党人同意
You want me to tell the Republicans to... get on board.

419
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,630
或让将军去做
Or have the general do it.

420
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,850
把政治放在一边  做正确的事
Put politics aside and do the right thing.

421
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,920
你真以为你这通电话
Did you really think you'd be able to convince me

422
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,850
能说服我吗  总统先生
by making this call, Mr. President?

423
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,650
我领先两位数  我的说法能博取支持
I'm ahead by double digits. I got a message that's working.

424
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,310
你有麻烦  就诉诸于我的责任感
You're on your heels, and you're asking me to help you

425
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,340
想让我帮你
by appealing to my sense of duty?

426
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,030
就连你都信了我的说辞
I've even got you sold on my message.

427
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,620
你不该太相信电视上的东西
Well, you shouldn't believe everything you see on TV.

428
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,800
州长挂电话了  总统先生
The governor has ended the call, Mr. President.

429
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,200
我们走
Let's go.

430
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,070
我们要出动自家的地面部队
We're gonna go forward with our own ground operation.

431
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,680
我去通知参联会  先生  还有件事
I'll inform the Joint Chiefs. Sir, there's another thing.

432
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,500
情报委员会
The Intelligence Committee...

433
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,010
如果康威在内部有人
If Conway has someone on the inside--

434
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,480
你是担心对监控的监督
You're worried about oversight on surveillance.

435
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,890
人们对此更加关注了
There's increased attention.

436
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,600
如果他们打探  发现了麦卡伦做的事
They dig around, find out what Macallan's up to...

437
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,940
我们不是无懈可击吗
Yeah, but I thought we were airtight.

438
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,530
莉安那么说  但还是...
Leann says we are, but still...

439
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,130
最保险的就是了结此事
The safest thing would be to end it.

440
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,910
克莱尔·安德伍德这两天一直在活动
Claire Underwood's been on the move the past two days,

441
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,190
走访康威州长办过活动的每一个州
showing up in every state Governor Conway's held events.

442
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,500
总统却一直缺席
Absent from the trail has been the President.

443
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,270
引用新闻发言人赛斯·格雷森的原话
Press Secretary Seth Grayson said, quote,

444
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,150
"总统目前正在处理
"The President is attending to the business of government

445
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,970
政府事务"
for the time being," end quote.

446
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,260
但他没有表明
But he neglected to say

447
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,080
总统何时会继续竞选
when the President would resume campaigning,

448
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,570
目前竞选网站上
and there are no upcoming events

449
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,130
也没有列出近期活动信息
currently listed on the campaign website,

450
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,260
这让人推测总统缺席的真正原因
leading some to speculate that the real reason for his absence

451
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,670
可能是身体问题
may be health-related.

452
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,880
总统接受肝脏移植已经过去六个月了
It's been six months since the President received a liver transplant.

453
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,360
虽然他可以继续正常...
Although he was able to resume normal...

454
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,290
-你的眼睛怎么了  -弗莱迪·海耶斯干的
- What happened to your eye? - Freddy Hayes.

455
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,830
那他什么都没说了
So I assume he didn't talk.

456
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,300
我需要一个切入点  丹顿先生
I need a way in here, Mr.Danton.

457
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,970
我已经尽力帮你了
I've helped you as much as I can.

458
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,840
我知道你不会公开作证
I know you won't go on record.

459
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,200
我甚至不要求你作为背景出现
I'm not even asking to put you on background.

460
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,240
我只想知道我是接近还是偏离
All I'm looking for is whether I'm warm or cold.

461
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,050
这是什么啤酒
What kind of beer is that?

462
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,300
贮藏啤酒  微酿的...我不知道名字
A lager. Some microbrew they had, um... I don't know the name.

463
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,640
我能尝尝吗
Mind if I try it?

464
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,220
请便
Go ahead.

465
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,450
好喝
It's good.

466
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,460
我年少时候玩过一个喝酒游戏
Used to play a drinking game when I was a teenager...

467
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,200
叫"我从来没有过"
called Never Have I Ever.

468
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,220
-知道那游戏吗  -有过那个经历就喝
- You know that game? - You drink when you have.

469
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,550
就是那个
That's the one.

470
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,080
或者如果总统有过
Or if the President has.

471
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,600
被特别检察官调查的时候
Never have I ever perjured myself

472
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,880
我从来没有做过伪证
when investigated by a special prosecutor.

473
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,290
我从来没有和雷蒙德·塔斯克达成过协议
Never have I ever struck a deal with Raymond Tusk...

474
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,880
让他做伪证换取赦免
to perjure himself in exchange for a pardon.

475
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,570
我从来没有密谋弹劾过总统
Never have I ever conspired to impeach a President

476
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,890
好让我自己当上总统
so I could become President myself.

477
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
我们得再叫点酒了
We're gonna need more beer.

478
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,660
-第一夫人在1号线上  先生  -谢谢
- The First Lady is on line one, sir. - Thank you.

479
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,200
克莱尔
Claire.

480
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,320
道格给我打电话说我们要派出自己的军队
Doug called me about sending in our own troops.

481
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,160
要么派出要么无所行动  康威不肯让步
Well, it was that, or sit on our hands. Conway wouldn't budge.

482
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,620
凯茜怎么说
And what does Cathy say?

483
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,060
我更想知道你的想法
I'm more interested in hearing what you think.

484
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,750
我认为...采取点行动总比什么都不做强
Well, I think... doing something is better than doing nothing.

485
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,930
活动怎么样了
How are the events going?

486
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,100
说不好  做了好多场  都分不清了
It's hard to tell. I've done so many, it's all a blur.

487
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,290
今晚只剩一场访谈了
There's only one interview left tonight,

488
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,880
今天就结束了
and then we're done for the day,

489
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,910
但是...明天有七场
but then there's, uh... seven events tomorrow.

490
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,410
你还好吧
How are you holding up?

491
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,990
我想告诉你汤姆不再为选举工作了
I called to tell you Tom's not working on the campaign anymore.

492
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,270
-他辞职了  -不是
- Did he quit? - No.

493
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,600
怎么回事
What happened?

494
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,640
我们俩决定这样最好
We both decided it was for the best.

495
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,400
我们不用担心他  弗兰西斯
We don't have to worry about him, Francis.

496
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,660
你听起来很累
You sound tired.

497
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,850
今晚好好睡一觉吧
Make sure you get a full night's sleep tonight.

498
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,890
-弗兰西斯  -怎么了
- Francis? - Yes?

499
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,420
没事
Nothing.

500
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,070
-明天见  -好的  明天见
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay, tomorrow.

501
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,130
-你确定安德伍德知道  -但沃克不知道
- You're certain Underwood knew? - And Walker didn't.

502
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,780
丹顿会不会有什么企图
Could Danton have some agenda on this?

503
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,690
他没有理由撒谎
He has no reason to lie.

504
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,260
除了他还有谁能证实
Who's corroborated, besides him?

505
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,650
没有了  所以我才来这儿
No one. That's why I'm here.

506
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,380
我需要制度支持  律师  调查...
I need institutional support. Legal, research...

507
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,650
还有不会被我的狗干扰的办公地点
a place to work where my dog won't bark at me.

508
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,500
如果能搞定这篇报道  你想做什么都行
If you crack this story, you can do anything you want.

509
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,270
-我还可以让你再当上主编  -我不要
- I'll even make you managing editor again. - I don't want that.

510
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,190
我想要的是...绝对自主权
What I do want... is absolute autonomy.

511
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,780
组建自己的团队  小规模
I build my team, I keep it small,

512
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,420
并且只向你汇报
and I answer only to you.

513
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,390
-人身安全呢  -这只是不走运
- How about security? - Oh, this was just some bad luck.

514
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,390
我已经失去两名记者了  汤姆
I've lost two reporters, Tom.

515
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,080
拜托  玛格丽特
Oh, come on, Margaret.

516
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,640
安德伍德或许是个坏蛋  但他不会杀人
Underwood may be a crook, but he's not a killer.

517
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,950
我也这么看  但我不想冒险
I don't think so either, but I don't wanna take any chances.

518
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,760
你把我要的人找来就好
You just get me the staff I need.

519
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,530
文章一旦发表  就没人能动我了
Once this article comes out, I'm untouchable.

520
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,610
白宫要想挥拳头  就让律师出面
When the White House starts throwing punches... lawyer up.

521
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,790
因为他只能冲着《先驱报》  不能冲我来
'Cause he's gonna throw 'em at the Herald, not me.

522
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,150
我以前的爱好
Hobby I used to have.

523
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,320
莽原之役
The Battle of the Wilderness.

524
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,320
{\an3}美国内战战役  1864年5月5日至7日

525
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,070
我花了几个月  造了一个模型
I spent months building a model of it.

526
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,080
之后想再造一个  却没有完成
Started another one, but never finished it.

527
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,180
-为什么  -我成了总统
- Why not? - I became president.

528
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,600
时间总不够
Never enough time.

529
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,090
克莱尔知道你叫我过来吗
Does Claire know you asked me here?

530
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,160
不知道
No.

531
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,960
你们不只是玩玩而已吧
It was more than just a fling, wasn't it?

532
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,650
-她怎么说的  -我没问
- How did she describe it? - I didn't ask.

533
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,570
我就不详述细节了
Well, I'm not gonna go into details.

534
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,640
那样对你太失敬
I respect you too much for that.

535
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,430
你们俩从德州回来时
When you two came back from Texas...

536
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,370
我就有所感觉
I had a feeling.

537
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,740
她说  你逗她母亲笑了
She says... you made her mother laugh.

538
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,130
是啊  看来她挺喜欢我
Yeah, I guess she took a liking to me.

539
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,740
上帝  30年来  我从没见那女人笑过
Christ, I haven't seen that woman laugh in 30 years.

540
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,020
因为我不是威胁
I'm just not a threat.

541
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,740
我不做评判  而是接受了她
Just someone who didn't judge, accepted her.

542
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,700
你把克莱尔也逗笑了吗
Do you make Claire laugh?

543
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,960
我们有共鸣
We have a connection.

544
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,960
是的  我也让她笑了
Yeah... I make her laugh.

545
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,870
让她有被渴望的感觉
I make her feel desired.

546
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,120
我觉得她愿意让我看到她脆弱的一面
I think she feels comfortable being vulnerable around me.

547
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,530
我得说  你没生气  让我有些惊讶
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised you're not upset.

548
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,960
-生气有什么好处  -我很钦佩  弗兰克
- What would that achieve? - I admire that, Frank.

549
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,670
我昨天对一个老朋友发火了
I got angry with an old friend yesterday

550
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,810
因为他叫我弗兰克  而不是总统先生
for calling me "Frank" Instead of "Mr. President."

551
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,220
就因为直呼你的名字吗
Just for using your name?

552
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,330
我想不是因为名字
It wasn't the name, I suppose.

553
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,840
而是因为他要离开我了
It's the fact that he's leaving me.

554
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,860
-怎么离开你  -换工作了
- Leaving you how? - New job.

555
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,240
-他本来为你工作吗  -就在白宫
- He worked for you? - Here in the White House.

556
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,600
下属要和上司做朋友不容易
It's tough for employees to be your friends.

557
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,830
所以我决定做个了结
That's why I decided to end it.

558
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,500
-是你要走的  -这样她就不用开口了
- You decided to leave. - So that she wouldn't have to ask me to.

559
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,140
那你的书呢
And what about your book?

560
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,330
我决不会那样背叛她
I would never betray her like that.

561
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,830
谢谢你  汤姆
Thank you, Tom.

562
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,020
-我送你出去  -我自己走就好
- I'll walk you out. - I know my way out.

563
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,910
不过谢了
But thanks.

564
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,880
保重  弗兰克
Take care, Frank.

565
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,740
三支队伍  北面  东面  西面
Three teams. North, east, and west.

566
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,650
我们形成三角攻势  向中心进发
We'll triangulate and advance on the center.

567
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,700
每支队伍都将有一名外勤特工
Each team will have a field agent

568
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,730
与当地人员一同寻找艾哈迈迪兄弟
working with local assets to locate the Ahmadis.

569
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,560
这是行政命令  先生
Here's the executive order, sir.

570
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,920
您希望直接击毙还是活捉
Do you have a preference? Dead or alive?

571
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,510
如果他们能提供情报  就活捉
Alive, if we can get intelligence out of 'em.

572
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,050
-谢谢  先生  -谢谢  先生
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

573
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,190
记住  你是在向我汇报
You're officially briefing me

574
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,500
关于哈里发国的监控行动
on ICO-related surveillance activities.

575
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,490
你从未与总统见面或谈话
You never saw or spoke to the President.

576
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,840
走这边
This way.

577
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,750
麦卡伦先生
Mr. Macallan.

578
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,190
-总统先生  -总统在他的宅邸
- Mr. President. - The President's in his residence...

579
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,440
不在这里
not here.

580
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,370
安全问题  我们有些担忧
Security. We have concerns.

581
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,260
康威在众议院情报委员会里有人
Conway has people on House Intelligence.

582
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,010
我把一切都掩盖好了
I've got everything masked.

583
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,510
监控哈里发国和给竞选用的算法完全相同
The algorithms for ICO and the campaign are identical.

584
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,980
只是输入的变量不一样而已
It's just a matter of what variables you input.

585
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,600
说通俗点
Give me English.

586
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,200
一只勺子  我可以用来搅拌咖啡
One spoon. I can use it to stir my coffee...

587
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,830
用来喝汤
to eat soup...

588
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,860
或是加热海洛因
to boil heroin.

589
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,070
他们只能看见勺子  看不见我用它做什么
All they see is the spoon, not what I do with it.

590
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,480
或者我们干脆让勺子消失
Or we could just get rid of the spoon.

591
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,250
关停吗  那太可惜了
Shut it down? Well, that would be a shame,

592
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,480
特别是在昨天之后
especially after yesterday.

593
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,620
-昨天发生了什么  -超越了发生
- What happened yesterday? - Beyond happened.

594
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,250
"超越"
"Beyond"?

595
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,660
你太太在南达科塔州说的话
What your wife said in South Dakota.

596
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,980
"超越美丽和完美"
"Beyond what's pretty and perfect."

597
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,560
摆脱习俗  过往
Liberation from convention, from the past.

598
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,800
超越表面  超越空谈  超越竞选
Beyond surface, beyond bullshit, beyond the election.

599
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,740
-超越婚姻  -正是
- Beyond marriage. - Yes, exactly.

600
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,030
你们不仅是夫妻  不仅是竞选搭档
You're not just husband and wife. You're not just running mates.

601
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,370
你们两者都是  却不止于此
You're both and more.

602
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,620
你们代表了一种可能
You're what's possible.

603
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,600
康维夫妇是梦幻偶像
The Conways are everything everyone wants to be.

604
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,950
但你们才是理想境界
You're everything everyone wants to become.

605
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,140
总统遭到了枪击  做了肝脏移植
The President has been shot. He's had a liver transplant.

606
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,640
我相信匹兹堡的所有人都在想
And I'm sure everyone here in Pittsburgh is wondering,

607
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,030
如果他死了怎么办
what happens if he dies?

608
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,970
无意冒犯  不过...
Not to be indelicate, but...

609
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,830
如果我成了总统吗
What if I became president?

610
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,960
这很合理
And that's fair.

611
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,600
我党选择我  因为他们看到的是
Our party chose me because they saw

612
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,110
一个团队不可分割的一半
one half of an indivisible team.

613
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,420
无条件的支持
Unconditional support.

614
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,910
携手共进多年的两人
Two people working together for years.

615
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,690
相互支撑是一回事
Supporting each other is one thing.

616
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,090
经验是另一回事
Experience is another.

617
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,490
你的经验很少
You have very little.

618
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,990
从你的戒指看得出你结婚了
I can see from your ring that you're married.

619
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,200
是的  18年了
Yes. Eighteen years.

620
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,210
那么你知道什么是真正的搭档
So you know what real partnership is.

621
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,350
我们一起走过了30年
We have 30 years under our belts.

622
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,920
相互学习  相互建议  这就是经验
Learning from and advising each other? I'd call that experience.

623
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,980
好  你们有坚实的婚姻
Okay, so you've got a strong marriage,

624
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,110
但说到你的资历
but in terms of your qualifications--

625
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,230
我想说的是
What... what I'm saying is

626
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,420
我们要超越夫妻关系来看
that we need to get beyond husband and wife.

627
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,230
我们要站在团队的角度看
We need to look at the team.

628
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,130
弗兰西斯在国会和白宫干过
Francis has served in Congress, in the White House.

629
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,640
我经营过大型非盈利机构  做过大使
I've run a major nonprofit. I served as ambassador.

630
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,950
我们曾一起通过立法  制定政策
We have passed legislation, developed policy.

631
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,660
一切都是我们一起做的  每一步都是
We've done all of that together, every step of the way.

632
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,240
所以我们一起竞选是很自然的事
So it's natural that we would run together.

633
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,120
而且我比谁都了解弗兰西斯
And I know Francis better than anyone.

634
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,780
所以  回答你的问题  如果他死了
So, if he died, to answer your question,

635
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,830
还有谁比我更适合实现他的美国计划呢
who better to carry out his plan for America?

636
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,040
操纵
Manipulation.

637
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,110
欺骗
Deception.

638
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,420
腐败
Corruption.

639
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,760
这就构成滥用职权和触犯法律了
That translates to abuse of power and breaking the law.

640
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,980
我们知道是这样  但我们需要确证
We know it's true, but we need corroboration.

641
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,190
要有公开证人  所有事实经过调查
People on record, every fact researched

642
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,480
并且反复核实
and checked and double-checked.

643
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,050
一切讨论内容不得外传
Nothing we discuss leaves this room.

644
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,340
不能透露给朋友  家人
Not your friends, not your family,

645
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,630
或是门外那50个
not the 50 reporters outside that door

646
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,060
想知道我们在这里干什么的记者
who wanna know what we're doing in here.

647
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,810
一旦白宫对我们做的事有一丝察觉
The second the White House gets wind of what we're doing...

648
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,170
他们就会设法让这个报道
they start to make this story...

649
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,850
消失
disappear.

650
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,980
你在电台访问中的表现太出彩了
The radio interview you did was spectacular.

651
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,370
感觉不错
It felt good.

652
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,810
我觉得我们终于找到发力点了
I feel like we're finally tapping into something.

653
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,150
你在南达科塔那对夫妇那里说的话
Was it Tom, what you said in South Dakota,

654
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,190
是汤姆想的吗
with the couple?

655
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,520
我看过视频了
I saw a videotape of it.

656
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,540
核心是的  然后...
The core of it, yes. And then...

657
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,650
我自己编了一些
I sort of made it my own.

658
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,050
他应该留下
He should stay on.

659
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,470
-不  -不是作为你的讲稿撰稿人
- No. - Not as your speechwriter.

660
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,860
我的意思是  对外人来说
Well, I mean, yes, to the rest of the world,

661
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,200
他还是我们的讲稿撰稿人
he can be our speechwriter.

662
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,630
但这不是他应该留下来的原因
But that's not why he should stay on.

663
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,530
他应该留下来  因为...
He should stay on because...

664
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,020
他能给你我给不了的东西
he can give you things that I can't.

665
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,950
克莱尔  我们一直是个强大的团队
Look, Claire, we've been a great team.

666
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,240
但是一个人...
But one person...

667
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,240
一个人终究不能给另一个人一切
one person cannot give everything to another person.

668
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,110
我不能和你一起旅行
I can't travel with you.

669
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,940
不能在夜里给你温暖
I don't keep you warm at night.

670
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,300
也不能像他那样看待你
I don't see you the way he sees you.

671
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,040
这事不由我允许  但是...
It-- Look, it's not my permission to give, but...

672
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,120
你会做对自己正确的事
you'll do what's right for you.

673
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,070
但我想让你知道  如果你想...
But I want you to know, if you want it...

674
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,960
我知道你会小心的...
I know you'll be careful...

675
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,600
我不介意
and I'll be fine.

676
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:09,450
如果我们要超越婚姻  那就超越吧
I mean, if we're gonna go beyond marriage, let's go beyond it.

给
Here.

688
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,320
我也不知道为什么买了花  我大概...
I don't know why I got them. I guess I, uh...

689
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,570
-总之  -真美  谢谢
- Anyway. - No, they're lovely. Thank you.

还有...再次感谢您...给我们捐款
And, uh... and thank you again... for that donation.

691
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,340
我无法表达这对我们多重要
I just... I can't tell you how much it means--

692
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,430
在语音留言里  还有之前通话时
You already thanked me on your voice message

693
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,970
你已经谢过我了
and when we talked on the phone.

694
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,900
不用再感谢了
You don't need to thank me anymore.

695
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,880
好  不说谢谢了
Okay, no more thanks.

696
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,260
希望这个地方还行
I hope this place is okay.

697
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,870
不是什么高档餐厅  但我常来
It's nothing fancy, but I come here a lot.

698
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,940
我喜欢  挺有个性的地方
I like it. It has a lot of character.

699
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,010
东尼喜欢这种小餐馆
Tony liked greasy spoons like this.

700
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,260
他以前每周日下午
He used to take the kids to,

701
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,100
都带孩子们去宾士红辣碗餐馆
Ben's Chili Bowl every Sunday afternoon

702
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,800
买热狗给他们吃
and get them hot dogs.

703
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,960
抱歉
Sorry.

704
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,180
没事
Don't be.

705
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,840
我也许不该谈我丈夫
I probably just shouldn't talk about my husband.

706
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,280
我还是会控制不住情绪
I still get emotional.

707
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,310
你可以谈...如果你想谈的话
You can... if you want to.

708
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,150
哪怕我哭
Even if I cry?

709
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,260
我想多了解他
I wanna know more about him.

710
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,730
能关一下门吗
Will you close the doors, please?

711
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,150
他在哪
Where is he?

712
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,600
我两天来了这里两次
Twice in two days I've been here.

713
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,830
我知道
I know.

714
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:12,140
为什么叫我来
So, why am I here now?

715
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,260
我希望你回来
I want you back.

716
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,330
我也是
I want you back, too.

717
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,330
但是...
But...

718
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,440
他理解
He understands.

720
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:23,600
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}从美国首位第一夫人玛莎·华盛顿
到现在住在白宫的米歇尔·奥巴马
美国历史上出现过很多杰出的第一夫人
她们不仅能在政务上辅佐自己的丈夫
成为总统的诤友良伴
更有几位还凭借非凡的才能和魅力
在美国历史上留下了自己的印记

722
00:49:23,600 --> 00:50:03,600
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}无论是比尔·克林顿两番问鼎白宫  还是希拉里·克林顿两次参选总统
他们一直都携手作战  既是夫妻  也是战友
在希拉里08年失败的总统竞选  和目前正在进行的大选中
她都将比尔·克林顿作为一件终极武器
因为比尔虽然离任多年  但在美国选民中一直有着非常高的支持率
但终极武器使用不当  也会事倍功半
比如在08年的选举中
媒体就认为比尔·克林顿过度攻击奥巴马  招致黑人选民反感
这对希拉里的失败要负有一定责任
在目前正在进行的选举中  比尔·克林顿也十分卖力
希拉里在初选初期凯歌高奏  比尔功不可没
