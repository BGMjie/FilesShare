梅达把她的手指...
Mayda slides her fingers in...

19
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,840
一直伸进她的婚戒里
all the way up to her... her wedding ring.

20
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,140
她把你推倒  然后倾下身来
She pushes you onto your back and leans down.

21
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,960
把手指伸进你嘴里  让你尝到
Puts the fingers into your mouth so you can... taste them.

22
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,260
戒指的金味儿
The gold of the ring...

23
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,240
你的舌尖可以尝到金属的腥味儿
You could taste the sting of the metal on your tongue...

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,550
混合着她的屄味儿
mixed with the taste of her cunt.

25
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,530
她倾下身来  冲你的耳朵低语
She leans down, whispers in your ear,

26
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,540
"我爱你  加吉克
"I love you, Gagik.

27
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,070
我爱你"
I love you."

28
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,600
-我就要来了  -她跨着你  把你拉进体内
- I'm close, man. - She straddles you, pulls you inside...

29
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,810
她的臀部前后摩挲  来回摩擦
grinds her hips back and forth, back and forth--

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,820
该死  你真会说
Ah, damn, you're good with words.

31
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,250
"...新罕布什尔两百年来
"...New Hampshire for over 200 years.

32
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,500
一直有些起起落落
There've been ups and downs along the way.

33
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,720
就像大埃默斯基格"
Like the big A-mos-ke-ag."

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,730
埃默  埃默斯
Am... Amos--

35
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,480
联系到她了吗
Do you have her?

36
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,230
她不肯接电话
She won't get on the phone.

37
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,990
-那就打给她的保安  -我打了
- Then get her detail on the phone. - I did.

38
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,910
他们不能逼她跟您说话  先生
They can't force her to talk to you, sir.

39
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,720
我们得考虑我单独出席活动  她不在身边时
We need to think about what to say when I show up at this event

40
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,850
该说什么
and she's not with me.

41
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,460
我不想读错词  让情况更糟
And I don't want to make it worse by mispronouncing this.

42
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,570
这个词怎么读
How do you say this word?

43
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,950
他们怎么不给讲话注音
They didn't put in the goddamn phonetics in this speech!

44
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,070
又不能让我自己去查
And I can't be expected to look this shit up myself!

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,220
我去替您查  先生
I'll find out for you, sir.

46
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,660
当然  这些年来...
And of course, there's been...

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,770
"一直有些起起落落"
"...ups and downs along the way."

48
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,510
就像20年代为薪酬和工时而举行的
Like the big Amoskeag strike in the 1920s

49
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,230
大埃默斯基格罢工
over pay and hours.

50
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,390
但这个行业也还是挺过来了
But this industry survived that as well.

51
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,860
这间屋子里的每个人都在传承一个传统
And all of you in this room have been carrying on a tradition

52
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,390
始于国家创始之初的传统
that goes back to the beginning of this country,

53
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,680
你们应该为此感到万分骄傲
and that's something you have to be very, very proud of!

54
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,580
"但这个州还有一项传统
"But there's another tradition in this state:

55
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,470
不自由毋宁死
Live Free or Die.

56
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,800
我妻子..."
Now, my wife--"

57
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,380
这个州还有一项传统
There's another tradition in this state:

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
不自由毋宁死
Live Free or Die.

59
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,450
不自由毋宁死
Live Free or Die.

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,220
当然  你们中一些人可能在报纸上读到了
Now, of course, as some of you may read in the papers,

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,200
也听到电视上的权威人士说了
and, uh, hear from the television pundits

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,700
我的对手在新罕布什尔有10个百分点的领先
that my opponent has a ten-point lead here in New Hampshire.

63
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,540
但是
But...

64
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,010
你们不能让民调和权威人士指挥你们
you're not gonna let polls and pundits tell you what to do.

65
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,430
-不  -或是告诉你们选举日该怎么投票
- No! - Or tell you how to vote on Election Day.

66
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,950
你们要让他们知道新罕布什尔人民能自己做主
You are gonna show them that New Hampshire makes up its own mind.

67
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,710
谢谢  谢谢大家今天前来
Thank you! Thank you all for coming out today.

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,460
天佑美国  谢谢
And God bless America. Thank you.

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,330

70
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,260
谢谢  非常感谢  谢谢
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

71
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,360
谢谢大家  非常感谢
Thank you all. Thank you all very much.

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,230
谢谢
Thank you.

73
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,490
她10分钟前在达拉斯降落了
She landed in Dallas ten minutes ago.

74
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,840
我们的说法是她去为初选打基础了
Our story is she's down there laying groundwork for the primary.

75
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,120
这只能给我们一两天时间
That only gives us a day or two.

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,370
如果她不参加活动  他们会觉得我有所隐瞒
If she's not doing events, they'll think we're hiding something.

77
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,510
你觉得她会待在农场吗
You think she'll stay put on the ranch?

78
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,130
我不知道  你盯住她一切活动
I have no idea. You keep track of all of her movements.

79
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,720
访客  是谁  次数
Visitors, names, times,

80
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,660
他们拉的屎什么颜色  臭不臭
the color of their shit and how much it stinks.

81
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,650
-是  先生  -你这就上飞机
- Yes, sir. - And I want you on a plane.

82
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,910
-回华盛顿吗  -去德克萨斯州
- Back to Washington? - Down to Texas.

83
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,140
-她在哪  -主卧
- Where is she? - The master bedroom.

84
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,360
黑尔太太提到她可能要打个盹
Mrs. Hale mentioned that she might take a nap.

85
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,800
我的房间布置好了吗
Is my room made up?

86
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,860
正在掸尘
It's being dusted right now.

87
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,840
-我想看看  -是  女士
- I'd like to take a look. - Yes, ma'am.

88
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,320
德州很重要
Well, Texas is an important state.

89
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,810
获得提名我们需要10%的代表
Nearly 10% of the delegates we need for the nomination.

90
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,050
但您说第一夫人今天会陪您一起来的
But you said the First Lady would be here with you today.

91
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,840
是啊  今早我们考虑了一下
Yes, well, when we assessed things this morning,

92
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,140
对新罕布什尔很有信心
we felt good about New Hampshire.

93
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,650
看看这群人  看他们多热情
I mean, look at this crowd, the enthusiasm.

94
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,770
你好  你好  我的老天
Hello, hello. Oh, my goodness.

95
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,000
你好  你真是可爱  叫什么名字
Hello there, aren't you a cutie? What's your name?

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,470
-盖比  -你好  盖比
- Gabby. - Hello, Gabby.

97
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,270
总之  我们想计划未来
Anyway, we wanted to start looking ahead.

98
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,130
克莱尔就是德州人
Claire's from Texas,

99
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,990
所以她提前过去也是应该的
so it made sense for her to head down there early.

100
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,300
你好  你好  谢谢你们前来
Hello. Hello. Thank you for coming out.

101
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,010
你不告诉我情况我就没法做工作
I can't do my job if you keep me in the dark.

102
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,610
你只需要知道你要往声明里写的内容
All you need to know is what you put out in the statement.

103
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,100
-是吵架了吗  -赛斯
- Was it an argument? - Seth.

104
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,580
听着  我每天忙着竞选的各种事
Look, I'm working 20 hours a day here on a normal day

105
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,490
就要干20个小时了  现在还要应付这个
with the campaign in full swing, and now this is on my plate?

106
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,860
我可以控制损害
Look, I can do damage control,

107
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,970
但我得知道损害是什么
but I have to know what the damage is.

108
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,570
好吧  我告诉你  我先去我房间
Okay. I'll fill you in. Let me get up to my room.

109
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,460
欢迎来达拉斯
Welcome to Dallas.

110
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,320
或许是个诱饵
Or maybe it's a decoy,

111
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,710
想骗我们在德州买广告
trying to lure us into making ad-buys in Texas.

112
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,900
那就能解释这为什么没写进她的日程了
That would explain why it wasn't announce as part of her schedule.

113
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,840
你跟我们在达拉斯的朋友通过话了吗
Have you spoken to our friends in Dallas?

114
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,010
没见人  没打电话
No meetings or calls.

115
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,880
如果她有活动  我们会知道的
If she were making the rounds, we'd know.

116
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,890
他们要么是很会掩盖
Well, they're either excellent at covering their tracks,

117
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,230
要么就是出事了
or something's up.

118
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,690
-什么事  -不知道  但我想知道
- Like what? - I don't know, but I wanna find out.

119
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,960
她要离开我  她怀着我的孩子呢
She's gonna fucking leave me. My kid in her belly.

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,850
她却要假装我根本不存在
And she gonna act like I never existed.

121
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,220
大概都把婚戒给当掉了
Probably pawned the wedding ring already.

122
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,140
-多少了  -还差两个
- How many is that? - Two more.

123
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,360
-你能怪她吗  -能  我能
- Can you blame her, though? - Yeah, I can blame her.

124
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,820
我给了她一切  她要夺走我的孩子
I gave her everything. She gonna rob me of my kid?

125
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,980
他上高中时  你还出不去呢
He's gonna be in high school before you're out.

126
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,630
那我也还是他父亲
I'll still be his fucking father.

127
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,370
你得让他们向前看
You gotta let them move on, man.

128
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,130
-否则不公平  -我告诉你什么不公平
- It's unfair not to. - Let me tell you about unfair.

129
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,450
好吗  我进来就不公平
Okay? Unfair is I'm even in here,

130
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,320
那贱婊子都不知道
and that fucking bitch doesn't even know it.

131
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,190
她以为我活该进来
She thinks I belong in this shithole?

132
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,920
你杀了人啊
You did kill a guy.

133
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,140
-你是说你没杀吗  -我没那么说
- Are you saying you didn't? - I didn't say shit.

134
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,960
因为我
Because I...

135
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,440
我有过怀疑
I had my doubts.

136
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,760
什么意思
What do you mean your doubts?

137
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,400
就是
Just...

138
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,940
从没觉得你是个杀人犯  仅此而已
never struck me as a killer, that's all.

139
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,910
你不了解我
You don't know what I am!

140
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,790
拜托
Come on!

141
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,950
放开  我无法呼吸了
Let up! I can't breathe.

142
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,150
我只是说
All I'm saying is...

143
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,380
我做犯罪新闻的时候
I interviewed a lot of murder suspects

144
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,890
采访过很多杀人嫌犯
when I was on the crime beat.

145
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,930
我觉得你是无辜的

我做了什么没做什么无所谓

白宫说你是来...

那只是为了不让国会竞选吸引太多注意

桃瑞丝·琼斯  她女儿要竞选

你是说西莉娅会退出

听着  就算你能说服西莉娅

239
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,250
那也还有个大问题

245
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,530

外人
An outsider.

247
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,140
我认为我们可以改变她对我的看法

248
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,910
听着  我不介意迎难而上

否则  我也不会在德州为民主党做顾问了
If I did, I wouldn't be consulting for Democrats in Texas.

250
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,330

- But what you're asking me-- - When you started your firm, LeAnn,

251
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,680
你父亲跟我父亲说你是在犯下大错误
your father told mine that you were making a huge mistake.

252
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,370
那是因为他是个共和党人
That's because he was a Republican.

253
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,650
是啊  但你没有犯错  不是吗
Yes, but you didn't make a mistake, did you?

254
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,670
你证明他错了
You proved him wrong.

255
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,940
很多顾问都能告诉我这为什么不行
Now, a dozen consultants can tell me why this won't work,

256
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,870
但我觉得你能告诉我这为什么行

她不会是为初选跟她见面

261
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,350
或许她觉得她可以竞选什么

262
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,420
-什么  这轮吗  -她一直希望当选公职

嗯  我们遇到了些问题...
Yeah, we've been having some issues with--

290
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,380
你知道枪哪点让我着迷吗  莉安
Do you know what fascinates me about guns, LeAnn?

291
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,890
扣下扳机  砰
You pull a trigger and bang,

292
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,740
一颗子弹喷出  快过声速
a bullet explodes out faster than the speed of sound.

293
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,220
如果你站的不是地方
And if you're on the wrong end of that bullet,

294
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,020
你还没听到声就会被它击中
why, it hits you before you even hear it.

295
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,520
总统先生  请原谅  但是
Mr. President, forgive me, but--

296
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,730
不  你听着  莉安
No, I want you to hear me, LeAnn.

297
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,710
你要停下跟克莱尔的胡闹
You will walk away from this nonsense with Claire.

298
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,960
你不要打电话  也不要接电话
You will not make a phone call nor answer one.

299
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,980
不要解释
You will offer no explanation.

300
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,980
不管你跟我妻子谈了什么
Whatever you discussed with my wife,

301
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,400
你要全部忘记  永远不再提及
you will erase it from your mind and never speak of it again.

302
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,350
告诉我你听到了
Tell me I've been heard.

303
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,060
是的  我听到了
Yes, I heard you.

304
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,570
很好
Good.

305
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,470
真可爱
This is cute.

306
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,750
请把它放下
Put it down, please.

307
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,890
当纪念品了
Souvenir.

308
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,910
电话也给我吧
I'll take that phone, too.

309
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,310
今晚愉快
Have a good night.

310
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,380
多快
How soon?

311
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,240
法官正在审核减刑令
The judge is reviewing the Rule 35 order now.

312
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,260
他一签字  他们逮捕了人
I mean, once he signs it, if they make an arrest,

313
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,750
这些人很快就能想明白
it won't take these guys long to figure out

314
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,280
是我跟联调局告密了
it was me that talked to the Feds.

315
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,370
他一签字  那就是几小时  而不是几天的事
Well, once he signs, it'll be a matter of hours, not days.

316
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,580
证人保护计划的安排已经定好了
The WITSEC arrangements are already being made.

317
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,250
-你知道他们要送我去哪吗  -不
- You know where they're sending me? - Nope.

318
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,600
我不会知道的  没人会知道
And I never will. Nobody will.

319
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,320
除了司法部
Except for the DOJ.

320
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,990
如果你有事要找我
If you need to reach me for anything,

321
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,070
你得通过证人保护计划负责人联系我
you're gonna have to contact me through the WITSEC officer.

322
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,880
我怕的不仅是亚美尼亚人
It's not just the Armenians I'm afraid of.

323
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,330
-卢卡斯  -我知道你一直不信
- Lucas... - I know you never believed me

324
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,260
-我说的总统的那些事  -听着  听好
- about the president but-- - Look. Listen carefully.

325
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,480
美国政府现在不是你的敌人了
The U.S. Government is not your enemy now.

326
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,880
好吗  他们在保护你
Okay? They're protecting you.

327
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,550
他就是政府
He is the government.

328
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,120
连白宫都不知道谁能靠减刑规则获释
Not even the White House knows who gets released on Rule 35.

329
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,810
除非司法部长说出去
Unless the Attorney General tells them,

330
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,260
几乎从来没有那种事
which almost never happens.

331
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,470
听着
Listen.

332
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,770
你干得很不错  卢卡斯
You did good work here, Lucas.

333
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:35,960
你要出去了
You're getting out.

334
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,370
开心点吧
Try to be happy about that.

335
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,380
你就这么放松吗
This how you unwind?

336
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,270
我从没来过这里
I've never been here in my life.

337
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,500
我想找个不会被认出来的地方
I wanted some place we wouldn't be recognized.

338
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,690
摆球吧
Rack 'em up.

339
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,480
-你说你有东西给我  -是的
- You said you had something to offer. - Yes.

340
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,400
保险
Insurance.

341
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,740
我们拿下了爱荷华州
We took Iowa.

342
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,350
在新罕布什尔州也追上来了
We're closing the gap in New Hampshire.

343
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,120
你们在爱荷华州是勉强胜出
You squeaked by in Iowa.

344
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,820
周二之前你在新罕布什尔是追不上差距的
You're not gonna close the gap in New Hampshire by Tuesday.

345
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,140
-你自信过头了  -你还是新闻发言人呢
- You're overconfident. - And you're still Press Secretary.

346
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,790
他可没让你做幕僚长
He didn't make you Chief of Staff.

347
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,300
别告诉我你没想往那儿钻
Don't tell me you weren't angling for it.

348
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,520
你想要什么
What's your ask?

349
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,490
一件我们可用的事
One solid thing for us to work with.

350
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,190
如果打击了他  你就有安全垫了
It tanks him, you got a cushion.

351
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,930
如果没用
It doesn't?

352
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,550
你还能继续在白宫工作
You still have your job in the White House.

353
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,740
我凭什么信你
Why should I trust you?

354
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,670
如果你输了  不想有个后备计划吗
Wouldn't you rather have a back-up plan in your pocket if you lose?

355
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,970
该你了
Your shot.

356
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,940
我们保证给你在政府留个位置
We guarantee you a place in our administration

357
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,180
我做两年的幕僚长
after my two years as Chief of Staff.

358
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,630
然后就是你
Then it's you.

359
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,620
告诉我德州是怎么回事
Tell me what's happening in Texas.

360
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,420
-安德伍德夫人  -议员女士  见到你真高兴
- Mrs. Underwood. - Congresswoman, so good to see you.

361
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,650
我也很高兴  请进吧
Wonderful to see you, too. Please, come in.

362
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,950
西莉娅  见到你也很高兴
Celia, so good to see you, too.

363
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,750
很高兴  安德伍德夫人
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Underwood.

364
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,270
莉安早先给我打电话  说她来不了了
LeAnn called me a little while ago. Said she couldn't make it.

365
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,460
议员女士  我叫莉安安排这次会议
Congresswoman, I asked LeAnn to have this meeting set up

366
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,210
是因为我有个大胆的提议
because I have a radical proposal,

367
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,900
我想当面跟你提出
and I wanted to make it in person.

368
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,510
道格已经跟我说了
Well, Doug has already filled me in.

369
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,290
我一般不会为任何人背书四年
Usually, I wouldn't endorse anyone four years out,

370
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,160
但这次  我乐意考虑
but in this case, I'm really open to it.

371
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,720
能让民主党人进入州长府邸就好
Anything to put a Democrat into the governor's mansion.

372
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,070
我跟议员女士说
I told the congresswoman that

373
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,990
用上她在达拉斯的政治力量
enlisting her political machinery in Dallas

374
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,270
是很关键的第一步
is a crucial first step.

375
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,320
所以我叫我女儿也一起来了
Which is why I asked my daughter to join us.

376
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,940
到时她已经接替了我的席位  你俩可以密切合作
She'll have my seat by then, and you two will work closely.

377
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,950
我对您十分敬重  安德伍德夫人
I have a great deal of respect for you, Mrs. Underwood.

378
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,360
我认为我们携手可以成就辉煌
I think we can accomplish a lot together.

379
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,870
其实  议员女士
Well, actually, Congresswoman,

380
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,110
我认为如果不先当选公职
I've decided that the governorship is a big leap

381
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,930
直接做州长跨度太大
without holding any elected office first.

382
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,420
你在考虑下一轮竞选参议员吗
Are you thinking Senate next cycle?

383
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,420
不  我在考虑本轮竞选你的选区
No, I'm thinking your district, this cycle.

384
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,960
那样的话  您女儿就得等等
That would mean your daughter holds off,

385
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,270
等我竞选州长时
and then I would throw my full weight behind her

386
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,270
会全力支持她接替我
to replace me when I run for governor.

387
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,910
我已经组织了团队
I've already put together my team.

388
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,010
不  你还是能得到席位的  西莉娅
Oh, no, you would still get the seat, Celia.

389
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,440
我只是求你再等等
I'm just asking you to wait a little longer.

390
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,680
总统认为这个方案最好
And the president thinks this is the best plan.

391
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,450
你怎么没说
Why didn't you tell me this?

392
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,190
-我并不知道  夫人  -他和我私下谈的
- I wasn't aware, ma'am. - Well, he and I spoke privately about it.

393
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,840
西莉娅为了等我退休已经等了十年多
Celia has waited over a decade for me to retire.

394
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,330
该轮到她了
It's her time.

395
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,480
我理解
I understand.

396
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,230
所以等她接过了席位  我希望能给她
And that's why I want to put her in the best position to succeed

397
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,700
-最有利的地位  -你上次踏入
- when she takes office. - When was the last time

398
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,680
这个选区是什么时候了
you set foot in this district?

399
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,800
弗兰西斯当选党鞭的时候
When Francis was elected whip.

400
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,530
我们要怎么要求选民支持一个
So, how are we supposed to ask our people to support a woman

401
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,800
根本不了解他们的女人
that doesn't even know them?

402
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,480
不了解他们的生活  他们每日的挣扎
Their lives, their everyday struggles.

403
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,930
投机谋利
Carpetbagger.

404
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,130
还是白人
Who's white.

405
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,790
不仅是种族问题  安德伍德夫人
It goes deeper than race, Mrs. Underwood.

406
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,870
你在海兰帕克长大  从小不缺吃穿
You grew up in Highland Park, never wanted for anything.

407
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,310
你无法体现我们的群体
You just don't reflect our community.

408
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,000
议员女士说得有道理
Congresswoman makes a good point.

409
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,280
我是想要个跳板
What I want is a stepping stone.

410
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,570
而你想联邦资助一家计划生育组织经营的
And what you want is federal funding for a breast cancer center

411
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,270
乳腺癌中心
run by Planned Parenthood.

412
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,170
如果共和党控制了国会  这就无法实现
Something that a Republican-controlled Congress will never do.

413
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,800
尤其是在退伍军人医院
Especially in a VA hospital.

414
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,210
即便是民主党控制国会时你也遭遇了阻力
You had resistance even when the Democrats controlled the House.

415
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,670
但国会议员  不管是共和党还是民主党
But there's not one congressperson, Republican or Democrat,

416
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,770
都不会拒绝跟第一夫人见面
that would refuse a meeting with the First Lady.

417
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,690
你说得对  安德伍德夫人
You're right, Mrs. Underwood.

418
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,960
我们没能实现我们的一切目标
We haven't accomplished everything we set out to do.

419
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,960
但我的选民一直拥有的
But the one thing my constituents have always had...

420
00:28:53,620 --> 00:29:00,280
是由自己人代表的骄傲
is the pride that they take in being represented by one of their own.

421
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,910
我不能剥夺这份骄傲
I refuse to rob them of that.

422
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,310
多谢您抽时间  议员女士
Thank you for your time, Congresswoman.

423
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,850
我们会重新考虑再联系您  谢谢
We'll reassess our thinking and get back to you. Thank you.

424
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,700
你叫总统别插手
You tell the president to stay out of this.

425
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,170
或许您该直接跟他谈
Maybe you should speak to him directly.

426
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,220
如果他肯支持我竞选  我就跟他谈
As soon as he's willing to support this race, I'll talk to him.

427
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,160
您在犯错误  安德伍德夫人
You're making a mistake, Mrs. Underwood.

428
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,840
白宫内部人士透露
A source within the White House tells us this,

429
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,650
第一夫人跟丈夫
that the First Lady traveled to Texas

430
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,470
大吵一架后飞去了德州
after some sort of a major argument with her husband.

431
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,590
总统称她去达拉斯
Well, the president has claimed that she went to Dallas

432
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,940
是为德州初选打基础
to lay groundwork for the Texas primary.

433
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,610
但她三天前抵达后  却不见举办任何
But there's no evidence of any campaign events or fundraisers

434
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,800
竞选活动或筹款活动
since she arrived there three days ago,

435
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,000
也未曾公开露面
and she hasn't appeared publicly.

436
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,680
那么  莫妮卡  得问问你对此事的看法
So, Monica, gotta get your take on this.

437
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,850
如果真的出现了婚姻不和
Well, if there is marital discord,

438
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,290
安德伍德夫妇肯定不愿承认
the Underwoods certainly wouldn't want to admit it.

439
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,330
她去那边筹备初选
Her being down there for the primary?

440
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,030
拜托  那完全可能是障眼法
Come on, that could be a smokescreen.

441
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,360
-胡安  -格雷琴  我们现实点
- Juan? - Well, come on, Gretchen. Let's be real.

442
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,130
这事不对劲啊
Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.

443
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,080
这时机简直太糟了
I mean, the timing on this could not be worse.

444
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,210
别忘了  新罕布什尔初选就在明天
Don't forget, the New Hampshire primary is tomorrow.

445
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,500
总统从爱荷华州带出来的好势头
So, whatever momentum the president had coming out of Iowa...

446
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,180
现在都像气球泄气一样流逝了
Just like air going out of a popped balloon.

447
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,180
希瑟·邓巴对此
Well, you know that Heather Dunbar

448
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,570
肯定有话说  我们看看吧
is gonna have something to say about this. Let's take a look.

449
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,450
我不知道此事是真是假
I don't know whether this story is true or not,

450
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,460
但如果是  我希望总统和第一夫人
but if it is, I hope that the president and the First Lady

451
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,340
能调和矛盾
can work out their differences.

452
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,450
没人希望看到一段婚姻出现问题
No one likes to see a marriage under strain.

453
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,620
个人而言  如果不是我了不起的家人
Personally, I wouldn't be able to carry on my campaign

454
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,810
我也没法竞选...
without the incredible...

455
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,920
知道是哪里走漏的消息吗
Do we know where the leak came from?

456
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,820
我们在找特勤局和员工问话
We're talking to Secret Service and to staff now,

457
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,100
但是  先生  暂时还不知道
but no, sir, we don't know yet.

458
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,960
我这儿有一堆十磅重的剪报
I'm looking at a ten-pound stack of clippings,

459
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,010
这还只是过去一小时里出来的报道
and that's just what's been written in the past hour.

460
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,380
这是邓巴干的  我知道是她捣的鬼
This is Dunbar. I know she's behind this.

461
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,700
先生  我可能有办法了
Sir, I might have a solution.

462
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,660
我们能单独谈谈吗
May we speak privately for a moment?

463
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,690
好  赛斯  挂线
Yeah. Seth, hop off the line.

464
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,460
如果我们要改变策略  我觉得...
If we're gonna switch tactics, I think I should--

465
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,950
如果总统打算采取措施我会告诉你的
I'll fill you in if the president wants to move forward.

466
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,700
挂线  赛斯
Hop off, Seth.

467
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,340
在辩论中  我们都记得
During the debates, we all remember,

468
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,330
安德伍德攻击夏普把孩子送去私立学校
Underwood went after Sharp for sending her kids to private...

469
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,350
好了  说吧
All right, go ahead.

470
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,370
克莱尔的母亲
Claire's mother.

471
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,610
她怎么了
What about her?

472
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,160
你五岁的时候我就告诉你
I told you when you were five years old

473
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,940
进屋一定要跟我打招呼
not to come in this house without saying hello to me.

474
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,240
我到时就去看过你  你当时睡了
I came by when I arrived. You were asleep.

475
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,470
那是两天前了
That was two days ago.

476
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,820
我不知道你是不是想见我  母亲
Well, I wasn't sure you wanted to see me, Mother.

477
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,770
好吧
Well...

478
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,480
既然我们要生活在一个屋檐下
as long as we're living under the same roof

479
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,580
-而且还被新闻车包围  -那个很抱歉
- and besieged by news trucks-- - I apologize for all that.

480
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,200
是真的吗
Is it true?

481
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,470
你是因为这个才来这儿吗
Is that why you came down here?

482
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,970
不  我来是因为
No, I came down here because...

483
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,030
那个来访的女人
That woman who visited...

484
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,270
-莉安·哈维  -我知道她是谁
- LeAnn Harvey. - Mmm-hmm, I know who she is.

485
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,370
她推销候选人的时候经常打给我
She calls me all the time asking for money when she's...

486
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,550
问我要钱
peddling some candidate.

487
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,990
你是候选人吗
Are you the candidate?

488
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,730
国会  30选区
Congress. 30th District.

489
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,080
这样啊
I see.

490
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,850
你不赞成
You don't approve.

491
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,780
你总是自己做决定
Well, you've always made your choices

492
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,030
不管我怎么想
regardless of what I think.

493
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,200
他怎么想
What does he think?

494
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,660
他跟你谈话了吗  劝我别那么做
Has he spoken to you? To discourage me?

495
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,930
你爸爸葬礼那天之后他就再没跟我说过话
He hasn't spoken to me since the day of your daddy's funeral.

496
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,530
你也一样
Just like you haven't.

497
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,640
你当上第一夫人都不来通电话
Not even a phone call when you became First Lady--

498
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,880
如果你不希望我待在这儿  我可以另做安排
If you don't want me here, I can make other arrangements.

499
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,310
别傻了
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

500
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,140
这房子是我的也是你的
This house is as much yours as it is mine.

501
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,300
我把东西都罩上
I put covers on everything

502
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,860
否则女仆还得打扫我从不进的房间
because the maids were cleaning rooms I never set foot in.

503
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,920
但既然你来了
But now that you're here...

504
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,370
别动了
Just leave them.

505
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,730
我只需要一间卧室
I only need a bedroom.

506
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,120
好吧
Fine.

507
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,150
这房子对你来说就是个旅馆
This house is just a hotel to you.

508
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,510
总统今天下午晚些时候会抵达达拉斯
The president will arrive in Dallas later this afternoon.

509
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,760
至于他此行的目的  我目前不能透露
As to the nature of his trip, I can't comment at this time

510
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,050
只能说他打算见第一夫人
other than to say he plans on seeing the First Lady.

511
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,880
-赛斯  -马克
- Seth! - Mark.

512
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,180
他南下似乎让他们婚姻出现问题的说法
His going down there would seem to lend legitimacy to claims

513
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,620
看起来更有依据了  不是吗
that they're having marital issues, wouldn't it?

514
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,690
我们已经否认了那种说法
We've already denied those claims.

515
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,010
-赛斯  -莎拉
- Seth! - Sara.

516
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,880
报道爆出后  总统
Neither the president nor the First Lady

517
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,220
和第一夫人都未曾公开做过回应
have publicly responded since this story broke.

518
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,490
他们会回应吗
Can we expect them to?

519
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,790
你所谓的报道  并非报道
What you're calling a story isn't a story.

520
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:31,980
只是个夺人眼球的标题
It's a flashy headline

521
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,870
帮你们在推特上涨粉
that gives you a bump in Twitter followers.

522
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,500
根本不值得对此做出回应
It doesn't warrant a response,

523
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,740
但如果总统或第一夫人决定回应
but if the president or First Lady chooses to make one,

524
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,280
肯定第一个告诉你
you'll be the first to know.

525
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,210
-赛斯  -谢谢大家
- Seth! - Thank you all very much.

526
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,840
-她离开多久了  -没多久
- How long has she been gone? - Not long.

527
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,030
-去了莉安·哈维办公室  -老天
- LeAnn Harvey's office. - Christ.

528
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,320
媒体没跟着她吧
The press didn't follow her, did they?

529
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,900
没有  他们走了条公用设施路
No. They took a utility road out.

530
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,100
没有警察随行
No police escort.

531
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,090
你俩要把问都不问一声就跑来
Are you two gonna make a habit of showing up here

532
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,080
当成习惯吗
without even the courtesy of asking?

533
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,820
我也希望不用来这儿
I wish I didn't have to be here,

534
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,000
但你女儿逼得我没办法
but your daughter's made it necessary.

535
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,740
她结婚时
You know, when she got married,

536
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,900
我以为过一两年她肯定会醒悟
I was sure she would wake up in a year or two.

537
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,530
没想到她用了30年
I had no idea it was gonna take her 30.

538
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,930
克莱尔是美国的第一夫人
Claire is the First Lady of the United States,

539
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,970
你还觉得她选错了人
and you still think she made the wrong choice.

540
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,840
变成小报谈资了
Reduced to tabloid gossip?

541
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,390
她跟住在你出身的那个拖车公园有什么区别
She might as well be living in that trailer park you come from.

542
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,800
是个桃子园
Well, it was a peach farm.

543
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,120
但你没说错  我还是白人垃圾
But you're right, I am still white trash.

544
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,950
我只不过恰好是个住在白宫的白人垃圾
I just happen to be white trash that lives in the White House.

545
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,290
就算当上总统  还是那么粗俗
Not even being president could give you any class.

546
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,470
我告诉你接下来会怎么样吧  伊丽莎白
Well, let me tell you what's about to happen, Elizabeth.

547
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,810
我不会站在交火的总统
I am not going to put myself in the crossfire

548
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,540
和第一夫人之间
between a president and First Lady.

549
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,260
我来应付弗兰西斯
Oh, I'll handle Francis.

550
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,170
你说他同意的
You said he was on board.

551
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,330
我会让他同意的
And I'll make sure he is.

552
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,420
重点是  你误导了我  安德伍德夫人
The point is you misled me, Mrs. Underwood.

553
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,350
你想要什么  莉安  钱吗
What is it you want, LeAnn? Is it money?

554
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,360
还是想要更多  真正有所成就
Or do you want more, to make a real mark?

555
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,940
我不用选  我可以兼得
I don't have to choose. I can have both.

556
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,840
如果你想青史留名  你就得离开德州
Well, if you wanna make history, you need to get out of Texas.

557
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,230
我拒绝过不少华府的工作
I've turned down plenty of jobs in D.C.

558
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,360
一年应付15位客户
Juggling 15 clients a year.

559
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,770
但我想要你接下来15年的时间
But I want the next 15 years of your life.

560
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,050
德州只是我们的起点
Texas is just where we begin.

561
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,840
看来你到底是没听到
It seems you didn't hear me after all.

562
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,770
我不向威胁低头
I don't respond to threats.

563
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,440
你在跟总统说话
You're speaking to the president.

564
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,630
是的  我认得出他的声音
Yes, I recognize his voice.

565
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,030
请让我单独跟我妻子谈谈
I'd like to talk to my wife alone, please.

566
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,160
她留下  你想跟我说什么就说吧
She stays. Tell me what you need to tell me.

567
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,440
道格
Doug.

568
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,400
她已经病了三年了
She's been sick for three years.

569
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,200
放疗  化疗  都做了
Radiation, chemotherapy, the works.

570
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,510
但你不知道  是吗
But you didn't know, did you?

571
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,590
你不能把我母亲拉到镜头前
You're not dragging my mother in front of the cameras.

572
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,260
只有你一人  你要说你是为此才南下
Just you, and you're going to say that that's why you're down here.

573
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,660
这是家事  弗兰西斯
This is a family matter, Francis.

574
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,320
这事必须做  克莱尔  我们得把传言止住
This has to be done, Claire. We have to kill this story.

575
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,170
他说得对
He's right.

576
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,520
我要知道你不会给我的竞选捣乱
I need to know you won't meddle with my campaign.

577
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,010
国情咨文就在两周之后
The State of the Union is in two weeks.

578
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,100
你到场  我就不再阻挠你
You show up for that, then I'll leave you alone.

579
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,520
我们赶紧了事吧
Let's get this over with.

580
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,430
克莱尔最初来到达拉斯时
When Claire first came down here to Dallas...

581
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,220
我们说是为德州的初选打基础
we said it was to lay the groundwork for the Texas primary.

582
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,140
这也算是事实
And that was partially true.

583
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,680
但我们没说的  是一些本想保密的私事
What we left out was something that we hoped to keep private.

584
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,040
但鉴于这几天来关于我们婚姻状况的
But in light of false stories over the last number of days

585
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,650
漫天谣传
about the state of our marriage,

586
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,700
我们现在认为只能说出这一不幸的消息
we now feel it's important to share this unfortunate news.

587
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,730
克莱尔
Claire.

588
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,240
这三年来
For the past three years,

589
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,480
我母亲一直在与间歇性淋巴癌做抗争
my mother has been suffering from intermittent lymphoma.

590
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,850
起初  她在与病魔的抗争中取得了胜利
Initially, she had some success battling her illness,

591
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,660
但这几个月  疾病复发而且非常严重
but it's come back full force the last several months.

592
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,060
所以  我来这儿陪她
So, I came down here to spend time with her

593
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,380
进行进一步的治疗
while she undergoes further treatment.

594
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,750
看在我母亲尊严和健康的分上
And we ask just for the sake of my mother's dignity...

595
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,560
我们请求大家尊重她的隐私
and well-being that you respect her privacy.

596
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,660
谢谢
Thank you.

597
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,170
我明天将继续我的竞选
I will be resuming my campaign tomorrow

598
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,200
克莱尔  当然了  将留在这里
and Claire will, of course, be staying here.

599
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,900
我还要说
And let me just add...

600
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,010
克莱尔的母亲有这样孝顺的女儿是莫大的福气
Claire's mother is blessed to have such a loving daughter.

601
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,820
我有如此体贴  善良的妻子也是三生有幸
And I am blessed to have such a thoughtful and caring wife.

602
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,280
谢谢大家
Thank you all very much.

603
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,400
平平常常  但也足矣了
Nothing fancy, but it'll do the job.

604
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,350
你正式是约翰·卡莱尔了
You're officially John Carlyle now.

605
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,090
驾照有意弄了个过期的  你得乘大巴上班
Driver's license is expired on purpose. You take the bus to work.

606
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,580
把一切都背下来  地址  生日  社保号
Memorize everything, address, birthday, social.

607
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,290
还有个人经历  也要熟练背下来
There's a personal history in there for you to know by heart, too.

608
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,970
-"飞马租车行"  -对
- "Pegasus Car Rentals"? - Yeah.

609
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,400
你洗租车  明天开始
You wash rentals. It starts tomorrow.

610
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,900
保持低调
Keep a low profile.

611
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,330
别表现出异常
Don't be weird about it,

612
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,090
别到处交朋友
don't go out of your way to make friends.

613
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,470
如果...
What if there's...

614
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,780
出什么事了呢
If something's wrong?

615
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,110
固话直接接到我们本地办公室
Landline goes directly to our local office.

616
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,300
出门在外  用旁边那部手机
Away from home, use the cell phone next to it.

617
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,800
-还有什么  -你有基本的有线台
- What else? - You have basic cable.

618
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,470
当然了  没有网
No Internet, obviously.

619
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,620
百叶窗拉好  门锁好
Keep the blinds drawn and the doors locked.

620
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,460
就这样了
That's it.

621
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,780
本周晚些时候我再来找你
I'll check in with you later this week.

622
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,530
我们不仅在新罕布什尔获胜
Now, we didn't just win a plurality here in New Hampshire.

623
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,450
而且差距悬殊
We won a majority.

624
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,040
知道这意味着什么吗
Now, you know what that tells me?

625
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,760
看来等票全数完  邓巴能领先
It's looking like Dunbar's got it by 11 or 12 points

626
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,300
11到12个百分点
by the time everything's counted.

627
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,100
已经报上来几个区了
How many precincts have reported?

628
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,420
两分钟前是83%
As of two minutes ago, 83%.

629
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,300
赛斯起草了讲话  等我们落地后用
Seth drafted a speech for when we land.

630
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,170
一般来说  邓巴会等你先发表讲话
Normally, Dunbar would wait to give her speech until after yours,

631
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:02,340
但既然我们在飞机上
but since we're on the plane--

632
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,700
-给她打电话  我让她  -好  先生
- Get her on the phone and I'll concede. - Yes, sir.

633
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,310
看那个乳臭未干的小白脸
Look at that snot-nosed pretty-boy.

634
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,620
他肯定刚学会刮胡子
I'll bet he just learned how to shave.

635
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,550
接邓巴
Get me Dunbar.

636
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,650
-女士  我真觉得...  -开门
- Ma'am, I really think-- - Open it.

637
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,360
她想一个人待着
She wants to be left alone.

638
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,530
打开门
Unlock the door.

639
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,000
你走
I want you to go!

640
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,510
母亲
Mother...

641
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,680
你为什么没告诉我
why didn't you tell me?

642
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,970
因为不关你的事
Because it was none of your business.

643
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,020
-听我说  -不  别费口舌了
- Just listen to me. - No, don't even bother.

644
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,520
我明白你为什么那么做
I understand why you did what you did.

645
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,950
但也还是一样伤人
But that doesn't make it any less hurtful.

646
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,500
那是为了我还是为了你自己
Is that for me or for yourself?

647
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,620
克莱尔
Claire.

648
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,970
过来
Come here.

649
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,460
过来
Come here.

650
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,780
你比他强大
You're stronger than he is.

651
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,210
但你得让他知道你的厉害
But you gotta put him in his place.

653
00:46:14,550 --> 00:47:04,550
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}与普选不同  美国各州的初选投票时间分散  前后长达数月
有时同一州民主党与共和党投票的时间也不同
如2016年美国总统大选  从2月1日的爱荷华州初选
到6月14日的首都华盛顿投票  两党初选要持续四个半月的时间
初选开局阶段主要包括爱荷华州  新罕布什尔州  南卡罗来纳州
以及内华达州这四州的选举  时间上先后有别
因此先举行初选的几个州的选举结果就非常重要
在最初的几个州获胜  不仅能助长候选人的气势  赢得尚未投票的选民的认可
还能获得媒体的关注  令党内大小金主慷慨捐款
2016年的总统选举中  爱荷华州选举结果揭晓当晚
两党便各有一名候选人因成绩不佳而宣布退选
前三个州初选结束后  两党共有八名候选人宣布退出
包括曾很受看好的前总统小布什的弟弟  杰布·布什

655
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:19,550
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}新罕布什尔是第二个举行初选的州
选举结果举足轻重  而该州面积小  人口少
因此历史上总统候选人在新罕布什尔的选举活动
多以小型集会为主
以便选民对各个候选人的立场进行深入透彻的了解
有时候候选人甚至需要挨家挨户敲门拉票
所以这里的竞选方式被媒体称为  "零售式竞选"
