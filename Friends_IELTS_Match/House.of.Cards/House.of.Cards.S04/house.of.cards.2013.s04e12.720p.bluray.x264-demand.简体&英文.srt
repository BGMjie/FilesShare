00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,840
那是注定要失败的
which is built to fail.

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,800
失败是不会为你加分的  总统先生
And you don't get points for failure, Mr. President.

38
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,820
人们不想要失败  他们要的是成功
People don't want failure. They want success.

39
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,190
那就讨论一下最近的功绩吧
Let's discuss our recent success then.

40
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,100
你一直指责总统
You have been very critical of the president

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,130
对恐怖活动的态度不够强硬
for not being strong on terror.

42
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,870
就在上周  特种部队逮捕了尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪
Just last week, U.S. Special forces captured Yusuf Al Ahmadi,

43
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,570
并把他收监入狱
and they have him in custody.

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,080
那么你现在会不会说
So would you now say that

45
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,590
你对总统的指责是毫无根据的呢
your criticism of the president was unfounded?

46
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,860
对艾哈迈迪的逮捕是一个进步
The capture of Ahmadi is a step forward,

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,900
但真正的问题是长久的安全
but the real issue here is sustained security.

48
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,950
总统没跟叙利亚人打招呼
The president sent in American troops

49
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,850
就派出了美国军队
without consulting the Syrians.

50
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,680
那对我们日后与他们的合作
Now, that's gonna do real damage to our ability

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,230
将造成很大伤害
to work with them in the future.

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,200
重点不在于建功立业
See, this isn't about notches in a belt.

53
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,540
而是给我们国家以更安全的世界环境
It's about a safer world for our nation.

54
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,130
给我们的孩子一个更好的未来
A better future for our children.

55
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,780
州长  我明白"安全""孩子"等字眼
Governor, I understand that words like "safer"

56
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,760
有很好的效果
and "children" play well.

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,200
但国家安全是一个复杂且千变万化的领域
But national security is a complex and ever-changing landscape

58
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,650
有时也需要约束
that sometimes requires restraint,

59
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,900
有时也需要果断的行动
sometimes decisive action.

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
所以我觉得我们最好
So I think maybe we want to

61
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,060
放下眼前听起来不错的词
put aside what sounds good in the moment

62
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,710
现实一点讨论适合我们的政策
and be adaptable with our policy in terms of reality.

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,600
我不需要人教我什么是现实
Oh, I don't need a lecture on reality

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,710
好像我还是小男生似的  安德伍德夫人
like I'm a schoolboy, Mrs. Underwood.

65
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,270
我真正在中东打过仗
I've actually fought in the Middle East.

66
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,820
将军也是
So has the general.

67
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,730
我们对国际外交的观点并不只是花言巧语
Our views on international diplomacy aren't just pretty words.

68
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,190
我们可以如你所愿讨论政策  州长
We can debate policy all you'd like, Governor,

69
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,760
但有一件事不容置疑
but there is one thing that is undebatable.

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,540
那就是没有了领袖的哈里发国
And that is ICO is no longer the threat it once was

71
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,020
威胁性已不比从前
without their leadership.

72
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,620
你不看辩论吗
You're not watching the debate?

73
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,390
我知道他们要说什么
I know what they're going to say.

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,010
我能帮你什么  道格
How can I help you, Doug?

75
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,670
我告诉过你会有这么一天的
I told you there'd be a day.

76
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,230
你完全可以带着这些光荣退休
There's no reason you shouldn't keep this and retire with honor.

77
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,740
情况如何
How are we looking?

78
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,110
"千变万化"很有冲击力
Yeah, high impact on "ever-changing."

79
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,390
康威上钩了
And Conway took the bait

80
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,950
连"小男生"和"花言巧语"都出来了
and played right into "schoolboy" and "pretty",

81
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,130
合起来就是"可爱男生"  太美妙了
which gives you "pretty boy." It was beautiful.

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,960
婚姻的事怎么样
What about the marriage stuff?

83
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,700
他们越是反复在任何语境中
Well, the more they can keep saying

84
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,790
说"一起"  "超越"
"together" and "beyond" and "become"

85
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,650
和"成为"  我们都加分
in any context, we score on those.

86
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,580
我不会跟你讨论
I don't discuss the private conversations

87
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,390
我们情报委员会的私下谈话
we have on the Intelligence Committee.

88
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,880
告密会让你孤立无援
Whistle-blowing insulates you.

89
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,010
那就给我党提名人拆台吗
And kneecap my party's nominee?

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,630
休想
I don't think so.

91
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,040
他会在这次辩论中说谎
He's going to lie about it at this debate.

92
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,380
他们都会
They both are.

93
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,370
你只是说出真相
You're going to tell the truth.

94
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,380
你不能二者兼得  州长
You can't have it both ways, Governor.

95
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,860
我们抓到他了  结束
We got him, period.

96
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,470
这是单方面  目光短浅的行为
Unilateral, short-sighted action.

97
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,620
单方面是因为你和将军
Unilateral because you and the general

98
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,260
让共和党就跟俄罗斯人合作的事反对我
pitted the Republicans against my involving the Russians.

99
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,750
那是无稽之谈
That's just not true.

100
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,650
你是说你没有
Are you saying that you did not

101
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,960
让将军跟众议院情报委员会的人联系吗
have the general contact members of the House Intelligence Committee?

102
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,840
将军  你愿意评论一下吗
General, would you care to comment?

103
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,380
我辞去职务后
When I resigned my commission,

104
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,210
就不再跟国会的人
I stopped talking to members of Congress

105
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,270
谈论国家安全事宜了
about matters of national security.

106
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,470
那么你是说你没有吗
So you are saying that you did not?

107
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,490
不  女士  我没有
No, ma'am. I did not.

108
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,300
你我都知道你插手了  州长
You and I both know that you interfered, Governor.

109
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,350
我私下问你的时候  你都承认了
You admitted so much to me when I asked you personally.

110
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,110
你跟我说将军
You told me that the general

111
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,980
曾跟委员会的成员谈过
had spoken to members of that committee.

112
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,700
我跟你说的是我在委员会有朋友
I told you that I have friends on the committee,

113
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,800
那是真的
which is true.

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,360
而不是我干涉了委员会的工作
Not that I interfere with committee work.

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,390
你让每个共和党人
You lined up every Republican

116
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,730
都反对俄罗斯入局
to be opposed to the Russians being involved.

117
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,490
他们都一致反对了
It was unanimous opposition.

118
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,860
如果你打算放弃钻井
Well, if your plan was to get Russian support

119
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,520
以获得俄罗斯的支持  我不怪他们
by giving away drill sites, I don't blame them.

120
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,890
那我们明确一下
So just to be absolutely clear, for the record,

121
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,860
州长  你是说
you are saying, Governor,

122
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,900
你本人或是将军都没有联系过
that neither you nor the General made any contact

123
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,130
众议院情报委员会的任何成员吗
with any member of the House Intelligence Committee?

124
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,390
我绝对没有
I absolutely did not.

125
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,960
你这是让我左右为难
You're putting me in an impossible place here.

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,860
你伪造服役记录时就将自己置于这种境地了
You put yourself there when you lied about your service record.

127
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,450
你想曝光谁的谎言
Whose lie do you want exposed?

128
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,850
康威的还是你自己的
Conway's or yours?

129
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,170
回家想一想
Go home and think about it.

130
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,270
不用赶在明天
Doesn't need to happen tomorrow.

131
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,070
只要在选举日之前就行
It just needs to happen before Election Day.

132
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,990
我不是想抹煞你对于你丈夫
I'm not trying to diminish your contribution

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,410
总统工作的贡献  安德伍德夫人
to your husband's presidency, Mrs. Underwood,

134
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,510
但我对你的经验表示质疑
but I do question your experience.

135
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,500
没有人在当上总统时
No one's fully prepared to be President

136
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,700
就充分准备好了
when he or she becomes one.

137
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,920
你也不能
Not even you.

138
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,790
看看民调结果
And look at the polls.

139
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,410
全国支持第一夫人做副总统的选民过半
Over half the country is open to a First Lady as VP.

140
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,990
想要一位新总统的选民也过半
And more than half of the country wants a new president.

141
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,050
你确实在民调中暂时领先  州长
It's true that you are leading in the polls for now, Governor,

142
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,610
但近几周内  差距正在缩小
but the gap has been closing in recent weeks.

143
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,150
当人们前去投票
Well, when people show up to vote

144
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,710
不得不面对克莱尔·安德伍德
and have to confront the possibility

145
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,260
成为总统的可能性
of Claire Underwood as President,

146
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,710
他们就要摸摸良心  做出正确的选择
they're gonna have a gut check and make the right choice.

147
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,390
说得非常对  那意味着他们会投给我们
You're absolutely right. That means they'll vote for us.

148
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,080
因为他们想想就会发现
Because they'll look around and realize

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,240
如果我出了什么事
that if anything happens to me,

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,320
他们能放心让克莱尔接手
they'll be in very good hands with Claire.

151
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,730
而且她说得对
And, you know, she's right.

152
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,020
没人能在做总统前完全准备好
No one can prepare to become the president.

153
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,590
而我已经是总统了
But I have been the President,

154
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,980
现在我知道那需要什么
and now I know what it takes.

155
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,180
需要的是信心  坦诚和效力
It requires confidence, openness, effectiveness,

156
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
而克莱尔具备所有这些品质
and Claire has all of those qualities.

157
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,830
很抱歉  总统先生
I'm sorry, Mr. President. It...

158
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,580
似乎我们得暂停一下
It looks like we have to take a break.

159
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,450
我们稍后将继续进行史上首次
We'll return shortly to the first-ever simultaneous debate

160
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,750
总统候选人和竞选搭档的同场辩论
between presidential candidates and their running mates.

161
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,080
已停
And we're clear.

162
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,080
总统先生  安德伍德夫人
Mr. President, Mrs. Underwood,

163
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,480
两位请跟我来一下好吗
would you please come with me?

164
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,820
念出来
Read it.

165
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,360
什么
What?

166
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,560
"我们是美国公民
"We are citizens of the United States.

167
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,930
我们被哈里发帝国组织  以真主之名
We have been taken hostage in the name of God

168
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,580
作为人质扣押"
by the Islamic Caliphate Organization."

169
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,270
念出来
Read it.

170
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,700
"我们国家犯下了非法侵略
"Our country is guilty of illegal aggression

171
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,940
和大规模屠杀穆斯林的罪行
and mass murder against Muslims.

172
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,850
我们恳求宽恕"
We beg for mercy."

173
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,870
只有满足以下要求  哈里发国才会给予宽恕
ICO will grant mercy only if these demands are met.

174
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,070
一  停止美军在叙利亚的一切军事行动
One, cessation of all U.S. Military activity in Syria.

175
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,930
二  向哈里发支付一百亿美元赔偿

176
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,040
三  安全送还我们遭到
Three, the safe return of our leader,

177
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,720
不公正囚禁的领导人  尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪
Yusuf Al Ahmadi, from his unjust imprisonment.

178
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,240
我们不会和罪犯弗兰克·安德伍德沟通
We will not communicate with the criminal Frank Underwood.

179
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,540
我们只和他的继任者威廉·康威沟通
We will only communicate with his successor, William Conway.

180
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,450
如未能在24小时内满足以上要求
If these demands aren't met in 24 hours...

181
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,200
将不予以宽恕
mercy will not be granted.

182
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,280
视频在七个渠道上发布
Released to seven outlets.

183
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,050
通过加密邮件和暗网
Encrypted email, Deep Web.

184
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,110
三名人质是吉姆和卡洛琳·米勒夫妇
The hostages are Jim and Caroline Miller,

185
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,780
和女儿梅莉莎  是诺克斯维尔人
their daughter Melissa, from Knoxville.

186
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,940
总统先生  不论你需要什么
Mr. President, whatever you need,

187
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,140
我愿意提供帮助
I'm here to offer assistance.

188
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,350
我会告知你的
I'll let you know.

189
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,780
我们目前识别出了板墙和照明设备
So far, we've identified the drywall and lighting.

190
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,180
都是美国制造的
All U.S. Manufactured.

191
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,590
视频是用松下高清摄影机录制
The video was shot on a Panasonic HD camcorder,

192
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,430
在美国销量最大
most widely sold in the States.

193
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,280
所以可以确定他们在国内
So we know they're in the country.

194
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,900
民航班机可以排除
Well, commercial flight is out.

195
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,150
私人飞机不太可能
Private plane is unlikely.

196
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,390
我们很肯定他们是乘坐陆地交通
We're confident that they traveled by ground,

197
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,230
可能是米勒家被劫持的汽车
probably the Millers' hijacked car.

198
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,420
最后已知地点是诺克斯维尔市外一家丹尼餐厅
Last known location is a Denny's just outside of Knoxville.

199
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,700
一笔借记卡交易
A debit card transaction.

200
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,450
这是他们离开餐厅的影像
This is footage of them leaving the restaurant.

201
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,290
我们心系米勒一家人及其亲友
Our hearts go out to the Millers' family and loved ones.

202
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,640
但我们相信总统
But we're confident that the President

203
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,560
正在尽一切可能营救他们
is doing everything possible to achieve their release.

204
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,210
我告诉总统  我们愿意
I told the President that we'd be willing

205
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,210
提供任何协助
to assist in any way if it would be helpful.

206
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,650
此时此刻美国必须团结一致并...
This is a time when America needs to pull together and...

207
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,660
暂停
Stop.

208
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,240
是"团结一致并为米勒一家人祈祷"
It's "pull together and pray for the Millers."

209
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,610
-然后再换我...  -我没忘词
- And then I come in, and-- - I didn't forget.

210
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,000
我只是认为这样做不对
I just feel this is wrong.

211
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,610
此举暗示我们愿意与恐怖分子谈判
It implies we're willing to negotiate with terrorists.

212
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,940
我们该保持沉默
We should keep our mouths shut.

213
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,590
让当权者去做他们的工作
Let the authorities do their job.

214
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,360
保持沉默不会为我们获得新闻版面
We don't get press by keeping our mouths shut.

215
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
你已经让我在全国节目上说谎
You had me lie on national television.

216
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,110
现在还要我们发布这种
And now you want us to send out some video

217
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,610
只会刺激恐怖分子的视频
that only encourages these people?

218
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,300
而且这么做只为博得版面
And you wanna do that to score some press coverage?

219
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,580
如果你认为这么做不妥
If it doesn't make you feel comfortable,

220
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,030
我可以自己来
I can do it on my own.

221
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,810
我在外面等
I'll be outside.

222
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,760
我受够他了
I've had enough of him.

223
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,870
他说的确实有道理
He does have a point.

224
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,620
无论我们是否发布这视频
Look, they're gonna kill that family

225
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,460
他们都会杀害那一家人
whether we send this out or not.

226
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,010
我们还不如说我愿意尽义务出面
We might as well say I was willing to show up for duty.

227
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,120
我必须说  我同意将军的看法
Well, I have to say, I agree with the General.

228
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,380
开始录像
Press record.

229
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,030
开始录像
Press record!

230
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,770
我们心系米勒一家人及其亲友
Our hearts go out to the Millers' family and loved ones...

231
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,250
关于劫持者我们掌握了什么信息
What do we know about the captor?

232
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,820
我们叙利亚的线人说这是起单独行动
Our Syrian assets say this is a lone wolf.

233
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,490
实际上  是两人的行动
Two wolves, actually.

234
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,380
我们调高了视频的对比度后
When we pumped up the contrast in the video,

235
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,140
在墙上发现了一个从摄影机后投射出的人影
we saw a shadow on the wall from someone behind the camera.

236
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,030
语音分析认为歹徒来自田纳西州西孟菲斯地区
Voice analysis points to western Tennessee, Memphis area.

237
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,110
总统先生  我能说几句吗
Uh, Mr. President, if I may?

238
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,490
霍尔布鲁克探员  我们的顶尖谈判专家
Agent Holbrooke, our top negotiating expert.

239
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,970
我们针对这种事件进行过
Uh, we've run 16 possible models in preparation

240
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,530
16种情况模拟
for an incident like this.

241
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,990
目前的事件包含三种情况的关键因素
Now, what we have here are key elements from three of them.

242
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,560
美国绑架犯  儿童遭绑架
American kidnappers, the abduction of a child

243
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,000
以及要求沟通代理人
and proxy communication...

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,670
他们为什么指名康威
Why did they want Conway?

245
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,200
这才是重点  我告诉你为什么
That's the real question. I'll tell you why.

246
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,290
因为换做是我  我也会这么做
Because I would've done exactly the same thing if it had been me.

247
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,700
这能削弱我的权威
It undermines my authority.

248
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,880
让我措手不及  挑起对立
Throws me off balance. Pits me against my rival.

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,960
还因为我没有孩子  而康威有
And because I don't have children, and he does.

250
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,100
他们知道我不会妥协
They know I won't compromise.

251
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,830
没有总统会妥协
No president would.

252
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,570
但康威这样的总统候选人  或许会妥协
But a would-be president like Conway, well, he might.

253
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,630
战术上我们需要更多时间
Tactically, we need more time.

254
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,000
我无法保证我们
I can't guarantee that we can

255
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,910
24小时内能追踪到他们
track them down in less than 24 hours.

256
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,570
够了  我的计划是这样的
Enough. Here's what I wanna do.

257
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,390
总统正与联调局
The president is working with the FBI

258
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,680
及其他执法和情报部门合作
and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies

259
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,200
寻找米勒一家
to locate the Millers.

260
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,830
为了确保这些行动不受干扰
Now, in order to protect the integrity of those efforts,

261
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,070
我目前无法透露任何行动的具体进展
I won't be sharing any details on their progress at the moment.

262
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,650
同时  总统还寻求康威州长的支援
In the meantime, the president is reaching out to Governor Conway

263
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,540
为一旦与劫持者建立了联系作准备
should contact with the captors be established.

264
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,270
有一点我要说清
Now, let me be clear.

265
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,640
这并不是谈判
We're not talking about negotiation,

266
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,320
只是沟通
just communication.

267
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,900
你大可先私下问我
You could've asked me privately first.

268
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,960
这是战略  向劫持者显示
It was tactical, to show the kidnappers

269
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,840
我们尊重他们的要求
that we respect their wishes.

270
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,250
这让我别无选择
This doesn't leave me a choice.

271
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,100
你可以拒绝嘛  州长
Well, you can always say no, Governor.

272
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,460
我们已有一份计划
We have a plan for how we can

273
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,690
即使没有你的参与也能处理
handle this without your participation.

274
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,920
那要怎么进行
How would that work?

275
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,310
我会公开表示
Well, I say publicly that

276
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,390
我愿意亲自与劫持者谈
I'm willing to speak to the captors myself.

277
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,160
如果他们拒绝
Now, if they refuse,

278
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,650
我们得做最坏的打算
we'd have to be prepared for the worst.

279
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,290
但我们团队相信
But our team believes that

280
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,630
有你在  我们建立对话的机会比较大
you give us a better shot at opening a dialogue.

281
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,190
好谈判
To negotiate.

282
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,210
好为我们争取时间
To buy us time.

283
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,430
如果你答应
And if you do say yes,

284
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,970
我们希望你尽快到白宫来
we'd want you at the White House as soon as possible.

285
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,420
我需要和我的团队讨论
I need to discuss with my people.

286
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,100
我希望你会同意协助我们
I'm hoping that you'll agree to help us.

287
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,190
无论如何  我尽快需要答复
Either way, I'll need an answer soon.

288
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,080
我了解  一小时内会给你回复
I understand. I'll let you know within the hour.

289
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,720
谢谢  州长
Thank you, Governor.

290
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,640
每个人都有缺点  而这就是康威的缺点
Everyone has a flaw, and this is Conway's.

291
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,200
我和总统谈过  我说
I spoke with the president, and I said that

292
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,360
我愿提供任何协助
I'm willing to assist in any way if it would be helpful.

293
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,380
他渴望聚光灯
He aches for the spotlight.

294
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,840
否则他几乎感觉自己是隐形的
He feels almost invisible without it.

295
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,510
如果他在这个舞台的中央
Now, if he's center stage on this,

296
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,730
他就不能挑我的刺
he can't fault my performance,

297
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,600
因为我们要共享这个舞台
because we're sharing the stage together.

298
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,560
如果我被喝倒彩  他就也被喝倒彩
If I get booed, he gets booed.

299
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,460
但康威渴望的其实是掌声
But it's really the applause that Conway's hungry for.

300
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,340
相信我  他会同意的
Trust me, he'll say yes.

301
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,800
舞台太大
The stage is too big

302
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,690
灯光太过诱人
and the spotlight too tempting

303
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,540
他受不了...仅仅当一个观众
for him to be... a mere spectator.

304
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,140
但我已经公开声明如果他需要我会协助
But I've already said publicly I'd assist if he asked.

305
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,430
那是个错误
That was a mistake,

306
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,180
我应该更努力阻止的
and I should've pushed back on it more.

307
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,670
但你不能让他利用你
But you can't let him take advantage of it.

308
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,650
我说都说了
Well, I've said it. It's done.

309
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,260
现在我们得往前走
And now we have to move forward.

310
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,760
这玩意真难喝
This is fucking disgusting.

311
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,850
你说  "经过慎重考虑
You say, "After much consideration,

312
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,240
我不愿意与恐怖分子谈判"
I don't feel comfortable negotiating with terrorists."

313
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,060
那我不仅成了一个骗子
And then I come off not only as a liar,

314
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,860
还是个懦夫
but as a coward.

315
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,090
我们都领先了  为什么要这么做
Why do this when we're ahead?

316
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,440
领先多少  5个百分点  那不是领先
By what? Five points? That's not a lead.

317
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,770
是碰运气
That's a coin toss.

318
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,340
整场竞选我传达的信息
My message this entire campaign

319
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,540
就是为国家服务  承担责任
has been about serving the country, showing up for duty,

320
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,740
现在三军统帅要我帮忙
and now I'm gonna not show up when the Commander-in-Chief

321
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,050
我却拒绝吗
has asked for my help?

322
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,870
...语言模式
...and the speech patterns.

323
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,090
劫持者是视频中说话的人
The captor is the one who you heard on the camera.

324
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,820
似乎是美国人
Seems to be American.

325
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,760
从他公布视频的方式可以看出来
And the way he's released the video shows

326
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,710
他是个电脑行家
he's computer savvy.

327
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,570
哈里发国招募人员已转向使用社交网络
Now, ICO recruiters have been turning to social media networks

328
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,900
比如脸书  推特  图片分享
like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,

329
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,150
和那些认同支持他们事业的用户取得联系
to initiate contact with users sympathetic to their cause.

330
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,700
-汤姆  -之前的组织  如基地组织
- Oh, Tom. - Earlier groups, like al-Qaeda,

331
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,280
使用社交网络的程度
didn't use social networking

332
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,940
均远远不及哈里发国
anywhere near the degree that ICO has.

333
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,130
劫持者有可能...
It is possible that this captor...

334
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,580
-总统先生  -飞行顺利吗
- Mr. President. - Good flight?

335
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,380
-有点颠簸  不过还好  -进来吧
- A little bumpy, but fine. - Come on in.

336
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,260
你弹吗
You play?

337
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,570
这个有待争论
Well, that's debatable.

338
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,150
但我确实收集
But I definitely collect.

339
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,890
这是个大事
Uh, this is something.

340
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,000
是啊  太可怕了
Yeah, it's terrible.

341
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,410
我不羡慕此刻的弗兰克
I don't envy Frank right now.

342
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,490
请坐
Have a seat.

343
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,290
-喝咖啡还是茶  -不用了  谢谢
- Coffee? Tea? - No, thanks.

344
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,380
发生了这么多事
I appreciate you taking the time,

345
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,050
我很感激你愿腾出时间见我
given everything that's going on.

346
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,620
反正又没人打电话寻求我的建议
It's not as though anyone's calling for my advice.

347
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,240
但这篇文章目前似乎没那么重要
Although I'm not sure this article is pertinent at the moment.

348
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,460
我不是来谈你的奖学基金的
I'm not here about your scholarship fund.

349
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,700
我不明白了  我的助理说你想写...
I don't understand. My assistant said you wanted to write--

350
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,030
我撒谎了...好让你肯见我
I lied... so you'd meet with me.

351
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,560
我们有国内监控项目  处于调试阶段
We have a domestic surveillance program, beta phase,

352
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,400
目标是找出哈里发国招募的人
aimed at finding ICO recruits.

353
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,340
外国情报监视法法庭裁决下来时我听到了汇报
I was briefed when we got the FISA court ruling.

354
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,170
这是国内调查
Well, this is a domestic investigation.

355
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,930
我们必须通过联调局工作
We have to work through the FBI.

356
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,070
他们准备派出一支队伍
Now, they're sending over a team,

357
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,690
我希望国土安全部和中情局加入
and I'd like for Homeland and the CIA to join them.

358
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,360
这事很敏感  你不应该关起门办事吗
This is a sensitive program. Shouldn't you keep it in-house?

359
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,480
我们过去曾因不让别的机构加入而受批评
We've been criticized for not involving other agencies in the past.

360
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,990
我想避免这个
I'd like to avoid that.

361
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,420
-你想要安全许可  -越快越好
- You want clearances? - As soon as possible.

362
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,090
事情紧急  需要齐心协力  道格
It's all hands on deck, Doug.

363
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,950
-州长  -总统先生
- Governor. - Mr. President.

364
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,140
这位一定是查理了
Well, and this must be Charlie.

365
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,820
-查理...  -和总统握手  查理
- Charlie... - Shake the President's hand, Charlie.

366
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,290
-来呀  查理  -你说他是个吸血鬼
- Come on, Charlie. - You said he was a vampire.

367
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,730
别担心  你在这儿很安全
Well, don't worry. You're safe here.

368
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,830
白宫里没有妖怪
No monsters in the White House.

369
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,710
我带你们去住的地方
I'll show you where you're staying.

370
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,230
好的  走吧  查理
Okay. Come on, Charlie.

371
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,170
你去过总统办公室吗
Have you ever been in the Oval?

372
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,000
小时候去过一次
Once, when I was a kid.

373
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,570
童子军  我们见了里根
My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.

374
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,650
当然了
Of course they did.

375
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,400
我想你们会想住在一起
I thought you'd all like to be together,

376
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,520
所以安排在了这里
so I've put you in here,

377
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,030
如果不想  我们可以让孩子住林肯卧室
but, if not, we can put the kids in the Lincoln Bedroom.

378
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,010
不用了  这儿太棒了  谢谢
No, this is wonderful. Thank you.

379
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,900
我们以后就要住这里吗  妈妈
Is this where we're gonna live, Mommy?

380
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,270
那得看大选的结果了
We'll have to see how the election goes first.

381
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,640
有股臭味儿
Something smells.

382
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,310
天啊  莉莉需要换尿布了
Oh, gosh. Lily needs a change.

383
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,140
请问哪里有...
Um, where--

384
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,110
从这儿往右走就是卫生间
The restroom is here, to the right.

385
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,960
太好了  谢谢
Great, thank you.

386
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,510
你想让我把一个共和党人送进白宫
You want me to put a Republican in the White House.

387
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,510
你是想要一个共和党  还是一个罪犯
You want a Republican or a criminal?

388
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,820
我对党还是忠诚的  汤姆
I still have loyalty to my party, Tom.

389
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,800
那他们对你的忠诚呢
And where's their loyalty?

390
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,290
他们都打算弹劾你了
They were going to impeach you.

391
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,140
杰姬·夏普说服了民主党
Jackie Sharp whipped Democrats.

392
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,730
你的国务卿也背弃了你
Your own Secretary of State turned her back.

393
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,150
你的党  已经烂到核心了
Your party? It's rotten to the core.

394
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,930
而那个核心  就是安德伍德
And the core is Underwood.

395
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,640
他偷了你的总统之位你就不生气吗
Aren't you angry that he stole your presidency?

396
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,460
我当然生气
I'm angry.

397
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,780
我气我自己
I'm angry at myself...

398
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,010
没能料到
for not seeing it.

399
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,310
还气我没和他斗到底
And for not fighting it.

400
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,890
那就现在反击吧
So do something now.

401
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,040
我本来想说塔斯克撒谎了
I wanted to say Tusk lied.

402
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,230
但是得到特赦后  我知道没人会相信我
But once I got the pardon, I knew nobody would believe me.

403
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,820
我就想
I thought...

404
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,070
"消失吧  躲得远远的"
"Just disappear. Go away."

405
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,160
而那种愤怒
And that anger...

406
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,120
如果我退隐了
If I went away...

407
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,980
那股怒气也会消失
that anger would go away.

408
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,350
真相要曝光了
The truth is coming out.

409
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,640
一起来揭露吧
Be part of the truth.

410
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,900
民众会相信你的
People will believe you.

411
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,890
等媒体发布会一结束  你的任务就完成了
Once we finish with the press conference, you'll be done.

412
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,540
后面交给我们就好
We'll take it from there.

413
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,920
如果他们联系我们  你不需要我接电话吗
You don't want me on the call if they contact us?

414
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,330
你的任务只是把他们引出来  州长
Oh, you're only there for bait, Governor.

415
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,810
我不能让你代表白宫和他们谈判
I can't have you speaking on behalf of the White House.

416
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,250
他们说了想和我交涉
They said they wanted me.

417
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,300
没错  但我们有计划了
Yes, we have a roadmap in place.

418
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,220
那就调整一下吧
Then you'll have to adjust it.

419
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,370
你有什么资格大摇大摆走进来
What right do you have to walk in here

420
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,300
对我们的应对方案指手画脚
and dictate how we're gonna handle this?

421
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,190
我来也是担了风险的  这你知道
I put myself on the line coming here, and you know it.

422
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,570
我大可撒手不管  让你自己焦头烂额去
I could've backed off and left this pile of shit in your lap.

423
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,350
如果我要和你一起出镜
Now, if I'm gonna be exposed with you,

424
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,220
那我对谈判方案就得有发言权
then I'm gonna have some say in how that happens.

425
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,140
要不我就回纽约  看着你出丑
Or I head back to New York and watch you squirm.

426
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,860
正中我下怀
Just as I'd hoped.

427
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,580
他搀和得越深越好
The more involved, the better.

428
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,490
请接格林处长
Director Green, please.

429
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,720
他们来了吗
They here?

430
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,140
-来了  -多谢
- They're here. - Thanks.

431
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,100
这是我们局长
This is our director.

432
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,040
-你好  -这是总统幕僚长
- Hello. - President's Chief of Staff.

433
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,010
我们需要过去三天内所有
We need every white male under 40

434
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,540
活动范围不正常的40岁以下白人男性的资料
with geo-local anomalies in the past 72 hours.

435
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,690
已整理好了  也和你们的监视名单核对过了
Already done that, cross-referenced with your watchlists.

436
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,500
我们正在匹配电话语音
We're voice matching with phone calls now.

437
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,030
我们会派一支队伍进驻
Well, we're bringing a team in here.

438
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,870
联调局  中情局  国安部和我们的人
FBI, CIA, Homeland, along with our own people.

439
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,870
同时参与的人太多只会...
Uh, yeah, more cooks in the kitchen won't--

440
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,970
我已经给他们权限了
I've cleared them.

441
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,410
我们不能在沟通上耽误时间
We can't waste time grapevining this.

442
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,210
让大家坐在一起工作
Let's get everyone working from the same place.

443
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,840
我们需要组织工作流程
We need to organize workflow.

444
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,070
好  我们去我办公室谈
Right. Uh, let's talk in my office.

445
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,830
往右第二间就是
It's the second door on the right.

446
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,100
会有问题吗
Is this going to be a problem?

447
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,550
我更希望他们不要监视我工作
I'd prefer them not breathing down my neck.

448
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,680
我问的不是这个
That wasn't my question.

449
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,520
我说了  都掩盖好了
I told you, we're masked.

450
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,190
谢谢  请坐
Thank you. Please be seated.

451
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,090
我想感谢康威州长同意来协助我们
I'd like to thank Governor Conway for agreeing to assist us.

452
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,290
他和我的目标是一致的
He and I share the same goal,

453
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,200
就是让米勒一家安全回家
which is the safe return of the Millers.

454
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,410
为实现这一目的
In order to achieve that,

455
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,560
我们将和劫持者
we're willing to open up lines

456
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,600
通过专线进行交涉
of communication with their captors.

457
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,620
州长
Governor.

458
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,480
我将作为你和总统之间的调解人
I will act as intermediary between you and the president.

459
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,140
想和我们联系
To communicate with us,

460
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,920
只需依次拨打吉姆和卡洛琳·米勒的社保号
dial Jim Miller's social security number followed by Caroline's

461
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,030
使用任何手机或网络运营商都可以
into any phone or Internet conferencing service.

462
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,570
然后将会有语音识别提示
There will be a voice recognition prompt.

463
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,380
让米勒一家念出自己的名字和即时时间
Have all three Millers say their names and state the time

464
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,870
连线即会建立
and that will connect you.

465
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,440
我们心系米勒一家和他们的亲属
Our hearts are with the Millers and their families.

466
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,190
我昨晚和他们的亲人通了话
I spoke to their siblings and their parents last night,

467
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,190
他们还在坚持着
and they remain strong.

468
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,490
我呼吁全体国民  为了他们  保持坚强
And I would ask all Americans to remain strong on their behalf.

469
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,780
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

470
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,190
虽然眼下情势非常险恶
Deplorable as this situation is,

471
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,580
但我们不能怪罪全体伊斯兰人士
we cannot blame Islam as a whole

472
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,070
也不应牵连国内渴望和平的数百万穆斯林
or the millions of Muslims in our nation who yearn for peace,

473
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,580
他们为我们的社会辛勤奉献
who contribute to our society,

474
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,700
和所有美国人共享一个美国梦
who have the same dreams as all Americans do.

475
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,150
哈里发国不能代表伊斯兰
ICO does not represent Islam.

476
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,900
但是某些别有用心的人会利用这次事件
But there are those who would use this incident

477
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,460
为采取强硬措施寻找借口
to justify draconian measures,

478
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,890
比如出行限制或强制注册等
like travel restrictions or forced registration,

479
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,830
他们这是在鼓吹仇恨  甚至暴力
who would espouse hatred or even violence.

480
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,330
一旦爱国走上了偏执的歧路
The moment bigotry becomes a form of patriotism,

481
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,150
美国就不再是美国了
America is no longer America.

482
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,090
所以我今天来到国会
That is why I'm here today, in the Capitol,

483
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,410
呼吁各位众议员
to urge our congressmen and women...

484
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,720
听说有人支持筹赎金
Hear there's a push to get the ten billion.

485
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,320
财政委员会吵翻了天
Big debate in Ways and Means,

486
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,840
但是绝对到不了众议院表决
but it'll never make it to the floor.

487
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,060
装装样子而已
It's just for show.

488
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,440
我一直在和拨款委员会谈
I've been with Appropriations.

489
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,580
-想绕过财政委吗  -不是
- Bypass Ways and Means? - No.

490
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,530
为向叙利亚派地面部队增兵作拨款准备
To pay for more ground troops in Syria if we need them.

491
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,590
那为什么约我来这里  而不是在国会
So why are you meeting me instead of at the Capitol?

492
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,240
汤姆·汉默施密特
Tom Hammerschmidt.

493
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,910
他也联系你了吗
Has he called you, too?

494
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,600
联系了  但我什么都没说
He reached out, but I haven't said a word.

495
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,180
沃克公开声明了
Walker went on record.

496
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,320
告诉他是我发动本党议员弹劾他
Told him I was the one who whipped the votes for impeachment.

497
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,310
你的说辞就是你认为他有罪
Your story is you thought he was guilty.

498
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,370
这没什么不对的
There's nothing wrong with that.

499
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,190
这么说你和他谈过了
So you have talked to him?

500
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,640
他有几个推论
He has some theories.

501
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,270
我只是把他想错的地方澄清了
All I did was shake my head at the parts that weren't right.

502
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,260
你不开口  就不会担责任
You're clean if you don't talk.

503
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,760
我想开口  接受他采访
I want to. On the record.

504
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,660
我认为你也该这样
I think you should, too.

505
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,640
我们不行
We can't.

506
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,110
那些照片一泄露  你的众议员席位就不保了
You will lose your seat as soon as those photos are leaked.

507
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,870
反正也快保不住了
I may lose my seat anyway.

508
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,720
康威的超级政治行动委员会
Conway's super PAC is targeting

509
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,400
在针对所有选情严峻的加州民主党参选人
every California Democrat in a tight race.

510
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,590
就算我赢了  国会也是共和党占多数
Even if I win, I'm in a Republican-controlled Congress

511
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,390
总统也是共和党人
with a Republican president...

512
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,070
要不就是再给安德伍德当四年走狗
or I have to do Underwood's bidding for the next four years.

513
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,630
那艾伦呢
What about Alan?

514
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,640
我把我们的事告诉他了
I told him about us.

515
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,590
他挺大度的
He was kind about it.

516
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,910
等事情消停了  我们就离婚
We'll divorce once everything quiets down.

517
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,100
如果你不希望照片流出  那我不开口就是了
If you don't want the photos out there, I won't say anything.

518
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,410
我不在乎全世界怎么议论我
I don't care about what the rest of the world thinks of me.

519
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,220
我只想保护你
All I cared about was protecting you.

520
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,520
那我们站出来吧  雷米
Then let's do this, Remy.

521
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,140
只要我们站出来  他就完了
You and I go on the record, he's done.

522
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,180
约书亚·马斯特森  田州理工计算科学专业
Joshua Masterson. Computer science major at Tennessee Tech.

523
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,290
过去两年一直热衷于研究
Taken a keen interest in Islamic studies

524
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,400
和伊斯兰教有关的事
during the past two years.

525
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,990
连续翘课三天
Hasn't been to class in three days.

526
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,050
也没有与亲友联系
None of his friends or family have heard from him.

527
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,850
他的声音和视频里的匹配
Voice matches the one in the video.

528
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,260
我们判断他的同伙是扎克瑞·霍松
We believe his associate is Zachary Hawthorne,

529
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,270
高中辍学  和马斯特森关系很近
high school dropout who's remained close with Masterson.

530
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,710
上周二开始翘班
Stopped showing up for work last Tuesday.

531
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,380
等他们打来  我应该...
So if they call, should I...

532
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,600
我要表明我们知道他们的身份吗
should I tell them that we know who they are?

533
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,380
不  你只要自我介绍就行  州长
No, you'll introduce yourself, Governor,

534
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,330
然后介绍我来接手对话
then you introduce me.

535
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,830
不  让州长和他们交涉
No, the governor will do the talking,

536
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,290
他到底能不能用他们的名字
so should he use their names or not?

537
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,670
这可能会刺激他们做出冲动之举
It could cause them to do something rash.

538
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,330
玛奇探员是我们的首席心理学家
Agent March, our head psychologist.

539
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,890
所以我不能提
So I shouldn't.

540
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,450
但反过来说  这或许能使他们回归常人
Conversely, it could humanize them.

541
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,420
消除匿名给他们的信心
Removes the confidence of anonymity.

542
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,860
但如果他们因此逃跑  那就坏事了
But if they run, it compromises everything.

543
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,140
不止如此  我们确信这就是他们的身份
Not just that. We're confident on the IDs,

544
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,990
但还是有极微小的可能猜错了人
but if there's the slightest chance we're wrong,

545
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,350
那就会削弱我们在谈判中的地位
it weakens our position.

546
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,390
那电话里先别提他们的名字了
Then don't use their names in the call.

547
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,590
先生  我们的对话脚本
Uh, sir, our script is written

548
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,450
是以我作为交涉人撰写的
with the understanding that I'd be speaking.

549
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,310
我们还需要为州长重新调整
We'd have to rework it for the governor.

550
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,590
那马上进行调整
Well, then let's rework it now.

551
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,110
我们不知道他们什么时候会打来
We don't know when they'll be calling.

552
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,430
虽然现在的情况很糟糕
You know, the circumstances are awful,

553
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,530
但我还是得承认
but I have to admit...

554
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,420
能从竞选中解脱一小会儿真是太棒了
it's been nice to take a break from the road.

555
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,020
我不知道你是怎么做到的
I don't know how you do it,

556
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,180
同时当竞选搭档和第一夫人
running mate and First Lady.

557
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,980
事实上我自己也在琢磨呢
I'm still trying to figure that out myself, actually.

558
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,510
我觉得这令人敬佩
I think it's admirable.

559
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,100
如果我们赢了
If we win,

560
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,570
我想做点更新图片分享之外的事
I'd love to do something more than update my Instagram.

561
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,610
我当时批评那个  只是...
When I criticized that, it was just because--

562
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,360
不  没关系  我不介意
No, not at all. I didn't take offense.

563
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,740
这是政治
It's politics.

564
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,750
我想做点类似你枪支法案那样的事
I'd love to do something like your gun bill.

565
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,540
没能通过参议院真是遗憾
It's a shame it didn't pass the Senate.

566
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,980
你支持那项立法
You support that legislation?

567
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,410
我来自英格兰
Mmm, I'm from England.

568
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,060
我们认为你们对枪支的痴迷太疯狂了
We think your gun obsession is madness.

569
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,120
威尔也是  但是他不能承认
Will does, too, but he can't admit it.

570
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,380
-不能惹怒中坚选民  -对呀  中坚选民
- Mustn't upset the base. - Ah, yes, the base.

571
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,250
不能惹怒中坚选民
Mustn't upset the base.

572
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,920
你其实是我的榜样
You know, you're actually a role model of mine.

573
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,430
你做的那些工作  环保
I mean, your work on the environment,

574
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,180
性侵犯  当大使...
sexual assault, being ambassador...

575
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,520
当然了  我更想我们赢
I mean, obviously, I'd prefer if we win.

576
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,100
但如果赢不了
But if we didn't,

577
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,970
你一定能成为一名优秀的副总统
I think you'd make a wonderful Vice President.

578
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,810
妈妈  你在喝什么
Mommy, what are you drinking?

579
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,770
是咖啡  亲爱的
It's coffee, sweetheart.

580
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,090
我也想要  我也想要
I want some! I want some!

581
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,220
别这么大声  会吵醒妹妹的
Not so loud. You'll wake your sister.

582
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,550
我能喝一点吗
Can I have some?

583
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,220
你还太小了
You're not old enough.

584
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,940
你想喝水吗  或是果汁
But do you want some water or some juice?

585
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,300
冰箱里应该有果汁
I think we've got some juice in the fridge.

586
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,310
我去拿
I'll get it.

587
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,530
他好可爱
He's very cute.

588
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,020
你后悔没要孩子吗
Do you regret it, not having children?

589
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,150
对不起  这个问题太私人了
Oh, I'm sorry. That's too personal.

590
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,170
那你后悔过要孩子吗
Do you ever regret having them?

591
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,430
声音已经确认了  他们在线上  先生
We've got voice verification. They're on the line, sir.

592
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,910
我需要拖住他们好让你们追踪通话吗
Do I need to keep them engaged so you can trace the call?

593
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,210
不用  是网络通话
No, Internet call.

594
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,940
每30毫秒换路由  无法追踪
Rerouted every three milliseconds. Untraceable.

595
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,280
我们有两个主要目标
We have two main objectives.

596
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,590
获取更多信息  拖延最后期限
More information, extending the deadline.

597
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,850
但最重要的是证明人质还活着
But our top priority is a first concession. Proof of life.

598
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,950
所以你什么都别承诺
So you'll promise nothing.

599
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,850
好
Okay.

600
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,340
记住他们可能会对通话录音
Keep in mind that they may be recording this call.

601
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,970
他们想要炒作
It's publicity they want.

602
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,310
好  我准备好了
Okay, I'm ready.

603
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,860
我是康威州长
This is Governor Conway.

604
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,690
我想和吉姆  卡洛琳和梅莉莎通话
I'd like to speak with Jim, Caroline and Melissa.

605
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,350
你和我说
You speak to me.

606
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,010
我需要证据证明他们还活着
I need some proof that they're still alive.

607
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,630
请告诉梅莉莎她的祖父母非常想念她
Please tell Melissa that her grandparents miss her very much

608
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,120
他们在为她祈祷
and, uh, they are praying for her.

609
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,450
你这么做不会让我们为他们感到抱歉
You're not gonna make us feel sorry for 'em.

610
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
你向无辜的穆斯林
How sorry did you feel

611
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,380
投炸弹的时候  又有多抱歉  州长
when you dropped bombs on innocent Muslims, Governor?

612
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,860
总统是个懦夫  派别人去替他杀人
The President's a coward. He sends others to do his killing.

613
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,020
但你更坏
But you're worse.

614
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,420
你还发表讲话说你对打了一场不义之战
You make speeches about how proud you are

615
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,000
感到多么的自豪
that you fought in an unjust war.

616
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,850
如果炸弹落在你女儿身上  你会是什么感受
How would you feel if a bomb was dropped on your daughter?

617
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,910
如果她被炸飞  死无全尸
If she was blown up and had to be buried in pieces?

618
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,360
你是美国人  对吗
You're American, right?

619
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,590
我们效忠于尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪
Our allegiance is to Yusuf Al Ahmadi

620
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,350
和哈里发帝国
and the Islamic Caliphate.

621
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,090
美国是我们的敌人  必须满足我们的要求
America is our enemy and must meet our demands.

622
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,320
你知道
Uh, you understand that

623
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,170
我不能代表政府说话
I can't speak on behalf of the government.

624
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,310
我只能把你说的话转达给总统
I can only communicate what you say to the President.

625
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,000
我需要些时间
I'll need some time.

626
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,010
你当我们傻吗  他正听着呢
You think we're stupid? He's listening right now.

627
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,900
我是总统
This is the President speaking.

628
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,780
我们只和康威说话
We talk to Conway only.

629
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,490
如果你想要什么的话
But if you want anything to happen,

630
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,400
只有我能办到
I'm the one that can make it so.

631
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,790
那你为什么什么都不做
Then why have you done nothing?

632
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,680
我在和国会讨论赎金的事
I'm talking to Congress about the money.

633
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,750
和我的军事顾问讨论撤军
I'm consulting with my military advisers about a pullout,

634
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,900
但这些都不可能在几小时内完成
but nothing can happen in a few hours.

635
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,150
你就是想拖延时间好找到我们
You just want more time so you can find us.

636
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,720
我们在找你们吗  是的
Are we looking for you? Yes.

637
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,890
只是为保证你们把米勒一家毫发无伤地交出来
But that's only so you'll turn over the Millers without incident.

638
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,150
不会有什么移交
But there is no handing over.

639
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,050
要么满足我们的要求  否则他们就得死
Either you give us what we want or we kill them.

640
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,390
不证明他们还活着  我们什么都不会做
Nothing will happen until we have proof of life.

641
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,440
好吧  给你个活着的证据
All right, here's your proof of life.

642
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,760
把那女孩舌头割了
Cut out the girl's tongue.

643
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,250
-不  -我是康威
- No! - This is Conway.

644
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,490
-不  -请不要冲动
- No! - Please, before you do anything...

645
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,800
-妈妈  -约书  扎克
- Mommy! - Josh. Zach.

646
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,620
你以为我们在乎你知道我们的身份吗
Do you think we care you know who we are?

647
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,070
不  住手
No, stop!

648
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,890
我想跟你谈谈  一小会儿就行
I'd like to speak with you, just for a moment.

649
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,040
我有话要说
I... I have something to say,

650
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,230
但别让梅莉莎再叫了
but I need Melissa to stop screaming

651
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,730
-这样我才能听清你  -不
- so I can hear you. - No!

652
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,780
我能听听她说话吗
Can I hear her voice?

653
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,200
我们必须听见她说话
We need her voice.

654
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,620
我在这儿  我是梅莉莎
I'm here. I'm Melissa.

655
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,250
你好  梅莉莎  我是威尔
Hi, Melissa. My name is Will--

656
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,720
你听见她说话了  快说吧
You heard her voice. Now talk.

657
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,180
不
Oh, no.

658
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,260
对  我杀过很多人
Yes, I... I've killed a lot of people.

659
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,730
其中有无辜者
Some of them innocent people.

660
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,620
每一晚
And every single night...

661
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,270
我都没对我妻子说过
I haven't even told my wife this...

662
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,590
但每一晚  我都做噩梦
but every single night, I have nightmares.

663
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,620
我想象我自己的女儿  莉莉
I picture my own daughter, Lily,

664
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,300
我的妻子  儿子
and my wife... and my son,

665
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,520
就像你说的那样
just like you described...

666
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,580
被炸飞
blown away.

667
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,140
死了
Gone.

668
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,220
你可以说我
Now, you could say that I...

669
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,780
我做噩梦是因为我做得不对
I have these demons because what I did was wrong

670
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,180
而你的动机是正义的
and that your cause is righteous.

671
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,740
但我当时也认为我的动机是正义的
But I believed that my cause was righteous, too.

672
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,580
如果能撤销发生的事
And if I could take it all back...

673
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,740
我不会做同样的事
I wouldn't do it again.

674
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,310
其实
The truth is...

675
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,690
我为我的行为感到羞耻
I'm ashamed of what I've done.

676
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,560
总统说得对
Now, the president is right.

677
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,010
我们需要更多时间来筹备你们的要求
We need more time to work on your demands,

678
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,520
但更重要的是
but more importantly,

679
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,820
我猜你之前从没杀过人
I'm guessing you've never killed anyone before.

680
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,560
身为一个了解杀戮的人  我要说
And speaking as someone who knows what it means to kill,

681
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,420
在做出无法挽回之事前
you owe yourselves more time

682
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,020
你该给自己更多时间
before you do something you can never take back.

683
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,390
约书
Josh?

684
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,410
早九点  你们的最后期限
9:00 a.m. You have till then.

685
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,960
他们结束通话了
They've ended the call.

686
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,730
你做得非常好  州长
You did an excellent job, Governor.

687
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,810
谢谢
Thank you.

688
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,140
我们有一通战况室电话的录音
We have a recording of the Situation Room call

689
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,800
是由劫持者在不久前放出的
released by the captors a short while ago.

690
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,330
在播放音频之前  我们想提醒听众们
Before playing this audio, we want to warn viewers

691
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,570
其中部分内容会令人不安
that there are sections that are very disturbing.

692
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,580
建议大家把电视静音
You might want to mute the television.

693
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,720
人都哪去了
Where is everybody?

694
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,500
他们都去忙劫持的报导了
They all got pulled on the hostage story.

695
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,790
把他们叫回来
Get 'em back here.

696
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,750
还有玛姬·蒂尔顿
And Maggie Tilden, too.

697
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,040
转录  马上做
Transcribe this, right away.

698
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,580
查塔努加市外方圆50英里范围内
Fifty mile radius outside of Chattanooga.

699
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,580
用偷来的信用卡买汽油
Gas purchase on a stolen credit card.

700
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,820
马斯特森的同学之一
One of Masterson's classmates.

701
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,730
我们现在要放出他们的照片吗
Should we just release their photographs at this point?

702
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,010
我的电话被打爆了
I'm getting bombarded with calls.

703
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,040
州长用的是名字
Well, the governor used the first names.

704
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,120
会有人把线索拼凑起来的
Someone's gonna put it together.

705
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
-我们不如利用这一点  -先生
- We might as well exploit it. - Sir.

706
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,270
-乔治  -总统先生
- George. - Mr. President.

707
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,120
通常  我会给你时间重新考虑
Normally, I'd give you time to reconsider,

708
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,830
但今天时间太紧
but time is in short supply today.

709
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,180
不行  我不能这么对党派
I can't. Not to my party.

710
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,030
党会撑下去的
The party will survive.

711
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,110
康威也许不能  没办法  他撒谎了
Conway might not, but too bad. He lied.

712
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,030
如果我这么对他  我就撑不过去了
If I do this to him, I don't survive.

713
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,370
我会被鄙视
I'm vilified.

714
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,950
我想给你看点东西
I wanna show you something.

715
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,650
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

716
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,520
这是我做党鞭时
This is your magnet

717
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,460
你在投票记数板上的磁铁名牌
from the vote count board when I used to be whip.

718
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,140
曾有很多次
There were so many times when

719
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,830
你不在我希望你在的位置  乔治
you weren't in the column I wanted you to be in, George.

720
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,460
我们都知道  我那时有几十次
And we both know that I could've forced you

721
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,800
可以逼你按照我的意愿投票
to vote the way I wanted you to dozens of times,

722
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,510
但我从没那么做过  我克制住了
but I never did. I held back.

723
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,750
是为了保护你的名誉
To protect your honor.

724
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,010
做党鞭的好处之一
And one of the advantages of being whip

725
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,970
就是每个党员
is that behind every single member,

726
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,500
每块磁铁名牌之后
behind all of these magnets,

727
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,790
都至少有一件不光彩的事
was at least one dishonorable thing.

728
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,800
只不过你的事恰好比大多数人都更不光彩
Yours just happens to be more dishonorable than most.

729
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,400
所以这次我要把你放在我那一栏里  乔治
So I'm putting you in my column this time, George.

730
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,420
莉安告诉我你在这儿
LeAnn told me you were in here.

731
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,760
我在写你的声明
I'm working on your statements,

732
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,730
为最坏的情况做准备
in case the worst happens.

733
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,680
真是紧张  这个地方
It's tense, this building.

734
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,330
墙壁里都透着这气息
You can feel it in the walls.

735
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,220
我早些时候去散步
I went for a walk earlier.

736
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,200
空气里都弥漫着紧张
It was in the air.

737
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,710
人们交谈都轻声低语
People were talking in whispers,

738
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,670
虽然完全没有必要这样
even though there was no reason to.

739
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,770
要不就两眼盯着手机
Or their eyes are glued to their phones.

740
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,270
没有孩子在外面玩耍
And there are no children out...

741
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,140
一个都没有
anywhere.

742
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,740
我想称之为恐怖是有原因的
I guess they call it terror for a reason.

743
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,630
比恐怖更糟  是恐惧
Worse than terror. Dread.

744
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,860
人们因一场悲剧把自己束缚起来
People girding themselves for a tragedy.

745
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,940
也可能反过来
Mmm, and it could go the other way.

746
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,340
你怎么样
How are you holding up?

747
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,890
汉娜在照看她的孩子
Hannah is minding her children.

748
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,050
我在照看她
I'm minding her.

749
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,840
她丈夫的表现真是出色  是吧
Her husband really knocked it out of the ballpark, huh?

750
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,170
你觉得他说的是真心的吗
Do you think anything he says is genuine?

751
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,770
这不重要  不是吗
Doesn't matter, does it?

752
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:53,960
起作用了就好
It worked.

753
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,140
你曾经说你觉得康威只会表面功夫
You said once you thought he was all surface, Conway.

754
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,260
是啊  自恋狂
Yeah, a narcissist.

755
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,710
但如果给他一滩水照照自己
But give him a pool to reflect in...

756
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,950
就要当心了
Watch out.

757
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,280
该怎么做  他清楚得很
He knows exactly what to do with that.

758
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,100
除非他弄巧成拙
Unless he overreaches.

759
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,470
你就希望如此吗
Is that what you were hoping?

760
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,470
希望他把这事搞砸吗
That he was gonna fuck it up?

761
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,060
因为他不会搞砸的
Because he's not gonna fuck it up.

762
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,140
他太聪明了
He's too smart for that.

763
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,900
"他升到空中
"There he soared,

764
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,940
从大本钟和伦敦眼旁边呼啸而过
zipping past Big Ben and the London Eye,

765
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,140
又从白金汉宫和皮卡迪利广场上方飞过
over Buckingham Palace and Piccadilly Circus.

766
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,360
看  他远去了"
Look at him go."

767
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,940
我马上回来  查理
I'll be right back, Charlie.

768
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,250
守夜的气氛特别阴沉
... the vigil is especially somber,

769
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,540
但上午早些时候达成的延期
but there remains a great deal of hope

770
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,580
还是带来了不少希望
after the deadline was extended earlier this morning.

771
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,690
-很多人将延期归功于州长  -情况如何
- Many credit that extension to Governor... - What's the latest?

772
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,230
有进展  搜索范围缩小了
Progress. They've narrowed the search zone.

773
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,810
通话中  可以听见梅莉莎在尖叫
During the call, Melissa could be heard screaming

774
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,550
因为马斯特森让霍松"割掉..."
as Masterson orders Hawthorne to, quote, "Cut out..."

775
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,020
水槽左边
Left of the sink.

776
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,200
{\an8}此时康威州长介入
That's when Governor Conway stepped in.

777
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,650
抱歉  你也来一瓶吗
Oh, I'm sorry. You want one?

778
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,400
不了  谢谢
No, thank you.

779
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,300
现在我们播放他说的部分内容
We're going to play some of what he said right now.

780
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,410
-因为你的肝吗  -对  我...
- Is it your liver? - Yes, I...

781
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,410
-保持清醒  -我杀过很多人
- Clear mind. - I've killed a lot of people.

782
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,850
其中有无辜者
Some of them innocent people.

783
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,960
每一晚...
And every--

784
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,530
为什么关掉
Oh, why'd you turn it off?

785
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,430
我当时就在旁边
I was there.

786
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,440
一定让你很抓狂吧
That's gotta drive you crazy, huh?

787
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,110
我这下要有多少正面报道了
How much good press I'm getting out of this.

788
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,390
-什么这么好笑  -没什么
- What's funny? - Nothing.

789
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,940
告诉我吧  我也想听笑话
Come on, tell me. I want in on the joke.

790
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,260
你以为你能激怒我
You think you can get under my skin.

791
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,810
我们第一次见面时  我就激怒你了
Oh, I got under your skin the first time we met.

792
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,180
什么时候  新年前夜吗
When? New Year's?

793
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,980
我记得我那晚恭维了你
I believe I complimented you that night.

794
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,900
但你尽可以
But you go ahead,

795
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,450
为了摆出更高的姿态
you tell yourself what you have to

796
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,080
自欺欺人
in order to stand a little taller.

797
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,100
我真为你难过
I feel sorry for you.

798
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,580
两年
Two years.

799
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,960
你只能待这么点时间
That's all you're gonna get in here.

800
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,220
你在任的时间不会比沃克长
You're not gonna last any longer than Walker did.

801
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,630
最让你难受的  是我会做个了不起的总统
And what kills you is that I'll make a great president.

802
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,050
真正会被铭记的总统
The kind of president who'll actually be remembered.

803
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,160
那不是比死还让你难受吗  弗兰克
And isn't that worse than dying, Frank?

804
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,750
被遗忘
Being forgotten.

805
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,460
你还真以为你会是个了不起的总统
You actually think you'd make a great president.

806
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,200
今天只是小试牛刀
Today was just a little taste.

807
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,420
总统99%的工作是不为人知的
99% of this job is in the dark.

808
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,160
你今天在阳光下闪耀了一会儿
I mean, you had your little moment in the sun today,

809
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,250
但当你要做无数个
but what are you gonna do

810
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,970
永远无人知晓  无人感激的决定时
when you have to make a thousand decisions that no one will

811
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,140
你要怎么办呢
ever hear about or appreciate?

812
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,930
我觉得你很擅长竞选总统
I think you're excellent at running for the president,

813
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,150
但我不认为你真有能力做总统
but I don't think you're equipped to actually be one.

814
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,580
别这么居高临下
Don't be condescending.

815
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,050
我是纽约州长
I'm the Governor of New York.

816
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,600
奥尔巴尼  是吗
Ooh, Albany, really?

817
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,350
你是个冒牌货  威尔
You're a pretender, Will.

818
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,190
而如果你赢了
And if you win,

819
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,930
你就从冒牌货成了骗子
you'll go from pretender to fraud.

820
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,770
威尔
Will?

821
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,940
我要让孩子们睡觉了
I'm putting the kids to bed.

822
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,180
那我不耽搁你了
Don't let me keep you.

823
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,910
-也许你该送他们回家  -还不到时候
- Maybe you should send them home. - No, not yet.

824
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,800
除了沃勒克还有别的打算吗
Do you have something else in mind besides Walleck?

825
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,060
有  而且我需要你帮我
Yes, and I'll need your help.

826
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,900
查理  你看见他了吗
Charlie? Have you seen him?

827
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,030
查理
Charlie?

828
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,410
妈妈  你看我找到了什么
Mommy, look what I found!

829
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,130
快瞧瞧
Oh, look at those.

830
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,190
还给我  你不能玩这个
Give those back. Those aren't yours to play with.

831
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,630
-我能留着吗  -快还回去  查理
- Can I keep them? - Oh, um, hand them over, Charlie.

832
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,350
-查尔斯  -要不这样吧
- Charles. - No, you know what?

833
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,570
你还是留着吧
You should keep them,

834
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,200
因为你这一生就应该顺心如意
because you should get everything you want in this life.

835
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,120
快说谢谢
Um, say thank you.

836
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,970
-谢谢你  -应该谢谢你才是
- Thank you. - No, thank you

837
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,330
多谢你来白宫看我们
for coming to the White House to visit us.

838
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,100
我们都休息吧  明早七点见
We should get some rest. I'll see you at 7:00.

839
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,810
那时候我早就起了
Oh, I'll be up way before then.

840
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,460
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

841
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,760
晚安
Good night.

842
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,750
我怎么帮你
You need my help how?

843
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,900
-还有谁知道  -没人了
- Who else knows about this? - No one.

844
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,800
我需要你尽快安排
I'll need you to make arrangements as quietly as possible.

845
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,900
好  我去办
All right, I'm on it.

846
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,190
我拿到地址之后马上告诉你
I'll let you know as soon as I have a location.

847
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,770
好  回家睡几个小时吧
Good. Then go home and get a few hours of sleep.

848
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,640
我今晚可睡不着
I can't sleep tonight.

849
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,890
试试吧  我们需要你明早精力充足
You should try. We'll need you fresh in the morning.

850
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,540
-联系参联会主席  -好的
- Get me the Chairman Joint Chiefs. - Yes, sir.

851
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,770
他在线上了  先生
He's on the line, sir.

852
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,450
主席先生
Mr. Chairman.

853
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,910
你想什么时候联系白宫
When do you wanna reach out to the White House?

854
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,200
明天  邮件我已经写好了
Tomorrow. I've drafted the email.

855
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,700
-你已经检查过了吗  -是的
- You looked this over? - Yes.

856
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,790
法律上我们没有问题
We're okay on the legal front.

857
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,670
但我们不该等人质危机结束吗
But shouldn't we wait until this crisis is over first?

858
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,560
绝不  这是我们的绝佳机会
No. This is perfect timing for us.

859
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,770
汤姆说得对  趁他不备  攻他不意
Tom's right. Let's hit him while he's distracted.

860
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,760
怎么样
How is it?

861
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,900
很好吃
Perfect.

862
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,280
你冰箱里实在是没什么可做的
Well, you didn't have much to work with in your fridge.

863
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,250
你得去买点吃的了
You need to do some grocery shopping.

864
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,180
-我不常做饭  -看出来了
- I don't cook a lot. - Obviously.

865
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,880
你需要的话就回去照顾孩子吧
If you have to get back to your kids...

866
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,070
没事
No, it's fine.

867
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,160
哈莉16岁了  有需要的话她会打给我的
Haley's 16. She'll call me if she needs anything.

868
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,090
他们看新闻了吗
Have they been watching the news?

869
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,620
看了  他们吓坏了
Yeah... and they're freaked out by it.

870
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,870
谁不怕呢  但是他们现在承受能力强多了
I mean, who isn't? But they've got thick skin by now.

871
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,230
比他们的同龄伙伴们镇静多了
Handling it a lot better than some of their friends.

872
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,490
我知道有好多父母
I know a lot of parents aren't

873
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,570
明天甚至都不打算让孩子出门了
even letting their kids out of the house tomorrow.

874
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,300
连学也不上了
Not even to go to school.

875
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,380
不过我的孩子还是会去的
My kids are gonna go, though.

876
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,300
我不会让这些畜生毁了我们的生活
I'm not gonna let these monsters rule over our lives.

877
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,130
-多谢你过来  -客气
- Thanks for coming over. - Of course.

878
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,240
我就算躺床上也只会盯着天花板发呆
I know I'd just be staring at the ceiling if I tried to sleep.

879
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,210
你的工作太繁重了
Well, you have a lot on your shoulders.

880
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,150
一般我会去参加个互助会什么的
Yeah, normally, I'd go to a meeting.

881
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,860
我只是...
I... I just, uh...

882
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,460
你只是希望能有人照顾你
You just wanted someone to take care of you.

883
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,060
能照顾别人也挺好的
And it's nice to take care of someone.

884
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,620
早上好  州长
Good morning, Governor.

885
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,960
你的电话
Your phone.

886
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,410
喂
Hello?

887
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,830
我们拍到一辆车
We have video of a car

888

901
00:43:47,600 --> 00:44:07,600
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}与人们印象中的"不与恐怖分子谈判"不同
美国政府处理人质绑架事件的原则实际上是
"不妥协  不让步"
就是说  美国政府未必不会与恐怖分子或恐怖组织
就人质问题进行协商
2015年6月  奥巴马政府通过总统行政命令的形式
进一步修改和明确了相关政策
允许美国政府官员代表人质家属同绑架者进行协商
但是法律仍然规定  美国政府不会向绑架者支付赎金
很多时候  "谈判"的界限在这种协商和交流中被模糊
有时候  美国政府也会为特定人质的获释付出很大代价

903
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:22,600
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}最近的一则例子  发生在2016年1月
三名美国公民在伊拉克被绑架
经调查  绑架者为当地什叶派军事武装人员
背后有伊朗支持
事发后  美国政府向伊拉克政府寻求帮助
在伊拉克情报机构和军方的斡旋下
三名人质于一个月后被释放
美国政府称  在寻求人质释放的过程中
他们没有直接同绑架者接触
但具体的谈判过程  绑架者是否得到赎金  外界不得而知

905
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:37,600
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}另一桩引起广泛关注的绑架案  涉及一名美国现役军人
2009年  美军士兵鲍尔·伯格道在阿富汗前线失踪
后确认被塔利班绑架
美军曾经组织多次营救行动  但均未成功
有特种兵战士在营救任务中阵亡
经过美国政府同塔利班的长期谈判
2014年5月31日  伯格道被塔利班释放
美国总统奥巴马亲自在白宫宣布了这一消息
作为交换  美国释放了五名被关押在关塔那摩监狱的塔利班囚犯
据媒体报道  这五名囚犯被俘前均在塔利班武装中担任重要职务

907
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:47,600
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}伯格道获释后  他的一些战友向媒体透露
他是擅自离开前线后被塔利班俘获的  是一名逃兵
部分美国国会成员和媒体对奥巴马政府
用五名高危恐怖分子换取一名"逃兵"的行为非常不满
白宫因此承受了很大压力
目前伯格道因叛逃罪正在接受军事法庭的审判
