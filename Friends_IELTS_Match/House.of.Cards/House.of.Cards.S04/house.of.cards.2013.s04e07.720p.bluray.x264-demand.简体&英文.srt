21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,650

I won't be able to complete the work I set out to achieve.

闹剧而非出路
a distraction rather than a solution...

25

早上好
Good morning.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,850
早上好
Good morning.

34
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,870
妈妈
Mommy?

35
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,320
你好  亲爱的
Hello, darling.

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,880
-我想吃早餐  -你想吃早餐
- I want breakfast. - You want breakfast?

37
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,080
-爸爸呢  -他在准备上班
- Where's Daddy? - Oh, he's getting ready for work.

38
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,250
我要给你剪头
I'm gonna cut your hair.

39
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,970
-不不不  -我要给你剪头
- No! No! No! - I'm gonna cut your hair.

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,510
-不不不  -为什么说"不"啊
- No! No! No! No! - What do you mean "No"?

41
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,260
不
No!

42
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,340
我要把你剪成小秃子
I'm gonna make you a little bald boy.

43
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,050
不  剃妈妈的头  别剃我的
No! No, shave Mom's head, not mine!

44
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,010
剃妈妈的头  好吧
Shave Mom's head? Okay.

45
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,710
-不  不  -我来剃妈妈的头

46
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,550
-不  -我来剃妈妈的头
- No. - I'll shave Mom's head.

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,560
我们最近太急了
We've been moving so quickly.

48
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,100
或许该退后一步  好好考虑一下
Maybe we should take a step back. Think this through again.

49
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,390
我们不能跟彼此别扭  克莱尔
We can't afford to be weird with each other, Claire.

50
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,180
别扭  什么意思
Weird? What do you mean?

51
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,170
我在厕所里看到你了  那么看着我
I saw you in the bathroom... looking at me.

52
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,520
不是第一次了
It's not the first time.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,540
有时候我想说些话  却不知该说什么
Sometimes I want to say something, I just don't know what to say.

54
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,230
-这很不舒服  -或许会永远如此
- It's uncomfortable. - Maybe it will always be like that.

55
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,130
但我们得排除那些  不能让它影响我们的计划
But we have to separate that out. It can't affect our plan.

56
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,770
因为这是唯一
Because that's the one thing...

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,470
我们已经想明白了的
that we have figured out.

58
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,460
沃克和瓦斯奎兹
When Walker and Vasquez...

59
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,160
背叛我们
betrayed us,

60
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,350
把说好给我的国务卿给了别人时
pulled the Secretary of State right out from under my feet,

61
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,700
当时不容我们有疑虑  是你提醒了我
there was no room for doubt, and you made me remember that.

62
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,380
我们走上了一条路
We took a path...

63
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,700
一条艰难的路
a difficult one,

64
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,980
因为完全无法保证这条路会通往何方
because we had no guarantee where it was going to lead us.

65
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,840
那需要莫大的勇气
It took a steel goddamn stomach,

66
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,750
自此之后我们不得不做的一切都是如此
and so has everything else we had to do since.

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,410
所以现在别去担心你和我
So don't worry about you and me now.

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
找到你的勇气  克莱尔
Find your steel, Claire.

69
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,730
感谢大家前来
Thank you all very much for coming.

70
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,140
你看到这个了吗
Have you seen this?

71
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,800
哈里发国  哈里发帝国组织
ICO. Islamic Caliphate Organization.

72
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,270
领袖是艾哈迈德和尤瑟夫·艾哈迈迪
Ahmed and Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

73
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,320
他们一直精明地分开行动
They've been smart about keeping split up.

74
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,190
万一一个死了  另一个就接管
If one dies, the other takes over.

75
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,520
但他们要在北叙利亚召开策划会议
But they're holding a planning session in northern Syria.

76
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,770
现在两人都在那里
Both are there right now.

77
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,820
约旦河谷的事我被整得很惨
I got my ass handed to me over the Jordan Valley.

78
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,850
我不能批准发动导弹袭击
I'm not gonna launch a missile strike

79
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,590
除非我相信国家安全受到严重威胁
unless I believe that there's an overwhelming national security threat,

80
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,110
而我不认为他们构成这种威胁
and I'm just not convinced that they pose one.

81
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,780
总统认为哈里发国是严重威胁
The president believes ICO to be a serious threat.

82
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,250
我们认为他们在积极地招募美国民众
We believe they are actively recruiting American citizens.

83
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,110
因此  政府要申请
Accordingly, the government is requesting

84
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,580
{\an3}在主干网上拦截电话和网络流量

85
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,580
702章上游监控令
a Section 702 upstream surveillance order.

86
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,790
-国内监控  -监控流量  不是个人
- Domestic surveillance. - Monitoring traffic, not individuals.

87
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,530
上前
Approach the bench.

88
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,770
外国情报监视法法庭  机密判决的闭门的
The FISA Court. Classified rulings behind closed doors.

89
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,420
就连他们都不知道我们今早派去了律师
Not even these men know we have a lawyer in there this morning.

90
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,200
哈里发国已经控制了三个油田
ICO already has three oil fields under their control.

91
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,820
俄罗斯减产时
They made a fortune selling crude

92
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,410
他们靠卖原油大挣了一笔
when Russia cut down production.

93
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,220
这是间接后果  先生  我们有责任做出回应
It's blowback, sir. It's our responsibility to address it.

94
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,110
如果我们发动袭击  只会让更多极端分子疯狂
If we launch strikes, we radicalize even more extremists.

95
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,960
先生  他们的军队会壮大的
Sir, their army will grow.

96
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,980
艾哈迈迪兄弟是前复兴社会党党员
The Ahmadis are former Baathists

97
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,810
有很硬的生意关系
with strong business ties.

98
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,570
如果现在出击  可以趁他们还没壮大砍下它的头
We can cut the head off before they get bigger if we strike now.

99
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,850
如果威胁等级提升  我们再重新考虑
If the threat level increases, we'll reassess.

100
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,980
先生  我们时机有限
Sir, we have a very limited window.

101
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,040
将军  总统已经决定了
General, the president's made his decision.

102
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,690
非常感谢  二位先生
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

103
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,380
我是批过一些比较过分的申请  史蒂夫
I have rubber-stamped some borderline requests, Steve,

104
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,990
-但这也  -我知道
- but this is very-- - I know.

105
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,290
我也觉得惊讶
I was surprised, too.

106
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,640
但这是直接来自白宫的意思
But it's straight from the White House.

107
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,290
这得要点时间了
Well, this is going to take some time.

108
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,060
我得好好审核一下
I have to do a proper review.

109
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,970
这把枪是一个职业罪犯非法地
This gun was illegally obtained by a career criminal

110
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,550
在一个不强制背景审查的枪展上购得的
at a gun show where background checks aren't mandatory.

111
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,870
这把枪在一次常规交通违章处理中
This gun killed Officer Dempsey's partner

112
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,940
打死了邓普西警官的搭档
at a routine traffic stop.

113
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,230
这把是在网上购得  完全没有背景审查
This one was ordered on the Internet. No background checks.

114
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,660
这把枪打死了鲍勃和苏·格兰特14岁的儿子
This gun killed Bob and Sue Grant's 14-year-old son.

115
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,300
这是打死了艾德华·密查姆特工的那把枪
And this is the gun that killed Agent Edward Meechum.

116
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,730
没几个特勤局特工能葬在阿林顿国家公墓
Not many Secret Service agents buried at Arlington.

117
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,270
我认为这是他应得的
I'd say he earned his place.

118
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,950
我没有意识到  他对我是多么重要
I took it for granted, how important he was to me,

119
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,700
我多么依赖他
how much I leaned on him.

120
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,510
现在他死了  我才看明白
It's clear to me now, now that he's gone.

121
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,300
我不想对你犯同样的错误  唐纳德
I don't wanna make the same mistake with you, Donald.

122
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,340
什么意思
How do you mean?

123
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,750
我之前没意识到我多么倚重你
I didn't realize how much I lean on you.

124
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,390
我中枪之后  你应对一切的手腕
The way you handled everything after I was shot,

125
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,650
堪称大师
it was masterful.

126
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,180
我...也就是勉强维持吧
Well, I... I guess I kept my head above water.

127
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,260
克莱尔跟我说了你给予了多大的支持
Claire told me how supportive you were,

128
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,670
证明了自己是怎样一位天生的领导者
what a natural leader you proved to be.

129
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,400
我想要这样的人留在身边  唐纳德
I want that by my side, Donald,

130
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,850
就像密查姆生前那样  我想要你做我的竞选搭档
the same way that Meechum was, as my running mate.

131
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,740
你要我做竞选搭档
You want me on the ticket?

132
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,440
据总统只有一步之遥  现在得严肃对待了
A heartbeat away from the presidency is a serious matter now.

133
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,160
康威是个不好对付的对手
Conway is a tough opponent.

134
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,870
我没想到你会想要我
I never expected you'd want me.

135
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,450
我以为我只是个占座的
I thought I was just a placeholder.

136
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,480
不  我们能赢的  唐纳德  你和我联手
No, we can win, Donald. You and I, together.

137
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,510
这行吗  弗兰克
I don't know, Frank.

138
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,820
你需要一个对此十分渴求的人
You need someone who's hungry for this.

139
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,070
我不是很会竞选
I'm not a great campaigner.

140
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,870
-佛蒙特州帮不上你  -你有很深的责任感
- Vermont doesn't help you. - You have a deep sense of duty,

141
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,560
就像这里埋葬的所有为国捐躯的男男女女
like all the men and women here who served their country,

142
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,910
这对我来说比策略重要多了
and that's far more important to me than strategy.

143
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,670
老实说  我不知道我是不是想要  弗兰克
To be honest, I don't know if I want it, Frank.

144
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,600
我接手的时候  那份压力  责任
When I had to take over, the stress, the responsibility...

145
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,960
两周的总统已经是我的承受极限了
Two weeks as president was about as much as I can handle.

146
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,560
我好失望  唐纳德
I'm disappointed, Donald.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,370
但我理解
But I understand.

148
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,460
我不会逼迫你
And I won't pressure you.

149
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,390
我们开始吧
Should we do this?

150
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,040
好了
Okay.

151
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,780
如果不是我  你有其他人选吗
Do you have other folks in mind, if it isn't me?

152
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,680
我们或许该联系一下领导层
Well, we should probably reach out to the leadership,

153
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,210
询问他们的意见
and get their advice.

154
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,280
但你是对的
But you're right.

155
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,140
不管是谁  得是一个对此十分渴求的人
Whoever it is, they need to be hungry for it.

156
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,330
这些死亡本都可以避免
All of these deaths could have been prevented.

157
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,520
因此
And that's why

158
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,490
我在跟一个参议员联盟合作  出台一部法律
I'm working with a coalition of senators to introduce a law

159
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,160
对所有枪支交易都进行背景审查
that will extend background checks to all gun transactions,

160
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,660
包括枪支展和在线销售
including gun shows and online sales.

161
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,660
我想说清楚  这不是针对枪支持有的打击
And let me be clear, this is not an assault on gun ownership.

162
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,720
而是对非法持有枪支的打击
It's an assault on illegal gun ownership.

163
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,550
我现在将回答问题
I'll now take questions.

164
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,670
有请下任美国总统
The next President of the United States,

165
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,080
我的挚爱  一个母亲最好的伴侣
the love of my life, the best father a mother could hope for,

166
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,480
我丈夫  威尔·康威
my husband, Will Conway.

167
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,120
康威  康威  康威
Conway! Conway! Conway!

168
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,290
纽约  你们好
Hello, New York!

169
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,600
他在所有战场州都以两位数领先
He's ahead by double digits in every battleground state.

170
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,660
共和党全国委员会筹集了我们两倍的钱
The RNC is raising two-to-one what we have.

171
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,410
-这人是个摇滚明星  -我们需要自己的摇滚明星
- This guy is a rock star. - We need our own rock star.

172
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,410
您在考虑谁  总统先生
Who are you thinking of, Mr. President?

173
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,810
唐纳德·布莱斯
Donald Blythe.

174
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,300
您不觉得有策略上更好的选择吗
Uh, don't you think there's a more strategic choice?

175
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,090
这就是出于策略考虑
I am being strategic.

176
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,850
邓巴退出是一码事
Look, it's one thing that Dunbar's dropped out,

177
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,310
但我们得拉拢她的支持者
but we have to get her supporters.

178
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,300
唐纳德·布莱斯一身清廉
And Donald Blythe, he oozes integrity.

179
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,480
他可以帮我们把那些
He can help us get all of those

180
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,430
幻想破灭的选民拉回我们的阵营
disillusioned people back into our camp.

181
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,120
大选中的温和派呢
What about moderates in the general?

182
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,480
我们需要一个来自摇摆州的人
We need somebody from a swing state.

183
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,940
而且有殷实的筹款途径
With deep fundraising pockets.

184
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,110
我们可以拿唐纳德的经验做卖点
Well, look, we can sell Donald's experience.

185
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,630
他已经替过班
He's filled the shoes.

186
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,860
为什么要半途换马啊
I see no reason to change horses midstream.

187
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,600
他的资质不够多
He doesn't check off enough columns.

188
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,820
我们需要个斗士  而不是个教授
We want a fighter, not a professor.

189
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,430
我同意  先生  我们能找到比布莱斯更好的
I agree, sir. We can do better than Blythe.

190
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,600
我实在想不出还有谁比
Well, I am hard-pressed to come up with anyone better

191
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,130
真正坐在过那张桌子后面的人更有资格
than a man who actually knows what it's like to sit at that desk.

192
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,010
我们可以给您提几个名字
We can offer you some names.

193
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,240
-他会很难过的  -我去跟他谈
- He'll be devastated. - Let me talk to him.

194
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,560
不  还是我来  我去找他谈吧
No, it's better that I do. Let me talk to him.

195
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,730
我们马上给您准备名单
We'll get you that list right away.

196
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,710
好吧  如果你能想到其他人选
Well, all right. If you can come up with some alternatives,

197
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,210
我绝对愿意听听  多谢各位
I'm certainly willing to listen. Thank you all very much.

198
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,330
我认为最好的政府  是职权最有限的
And I believe the best government is that which governs least.

199
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,330
这并非新的思想  而是个老的
That's not a new idea. It's an old one.

200
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,210
是我党创始人  杰弗逊说的
The founder of our party, Jefferson, said it.

201
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,010
我们得赋予它新生
We need to make it new again.

202
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,780
我们需要一个不干扰人民生活的政府
We need a government that doesn't interfere with people's lives,

203
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,710
不打扰他们的自由  他们对幸福的追求
with their liberty, with their pursuit of happiness.

204
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,570
这不正是我们需要保护的吗
Isn't that what we need to protect?

205
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,970
是的
Yes.

206
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,560
而这正是安德伍德总统最让我们失望之处
And that's where President Underwood is failing us the most.

207
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,830
道格  那个进展...
Doug, where are we on the, uh--

208
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,400
外国情报监视法法庭还得要一阵  法官不太情愿
FISA Court could take a while. The judge was reluctant.

209
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,100
我还是应该安排一次会面
I should set up a meeting anyway.

210
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,250
我一直不喜欢这个计划  先生
I've never liked this plan, sir.

211
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,830
我觉得拿到法庭裁决之前我们不该妄动
I don't think we should do anything until we get the court ruling.

212
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,750
A计划已经启动了  我们先看看结果吧
Plan A is in motion, let's let that pan out first.

213
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,830
如果A计划成功  那么波利跳就不是问题了
If plan A works, then fine, Pollyhop is no longer a problem,

214
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,990
但如果不成功  我得开始打基础了
but if it doesn't, I need to start laying the groundwork.

215
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,190
-麦卡伦没那么好说服  -我们不了解此人
- Macallan could take some convincing. - We don't know this man--

216
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,760
我们现在并不非得扩大圈子
Yeah, we don't absolutely need to widen the circle right now.

217
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,440
是非得  先生
We do, sir.

218
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,650
光是启动这样的监控行动就得要好几周
Just to get this sort of surveillance operational can take weeks.

219
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,540
但道格说得对
Yeah, but Doug is right.

220
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,160
我们不了解他  他对我们是个陌生人
We don't know him. He's a stranger to us.

221
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,690
他是国内  或许是全世界最棒的数据科学家
He is the top data scientist in the country, maybe the world.

222
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,620
-他曾研究行为浸染...  -行了
- He was exploring behavior adoption and immersing... - Stop.

223
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,590
这可是国内监控  莉安
We are talking domestic surveillance, LeAnn.

224
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,470
我唯一在乎的理论就是风险和票数的比例
And the only theory I'm interested in is risk versus votes.

225
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,710
他能帮我们拉到票
And he gets us the votes.

226
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,130
您没听到领导层的话吗
Didn't you hear the leadership?

227
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,240
他们说康威要把我们灭掉了
They said Conway is destroying us.

228
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,310
麦卡伦能逆转这一点  他能帮我们拿下选举
Macallan reverses that, he wins us the election.

229
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,040
"哈里发国占领了库尔德要塞"
"ICO occupies Kurdish stronghold."

230
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,840
有多少人听说过哈里发国
How many of you have heard of ICO?

231
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,870
他们是穆斯林极端分子  在叙利亚攻占油田
They're Muslim extremists taking over oil fields in Syria.

232
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,390
媒体对他们几乎鲜有报道
The media is barely covering them

233
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,460
就因为白宫对此睁一只眼闭一只眼
because the White House is turning a blind eye.

234
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,060
作为纽约州长
As the Governor of New York...

235
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,300
我无法对恐怖主义视而不见
I can't turn a blind eye to terrorism

236
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,410
因为它曾发生在我们家门口
because it's been right here on our doorstep.

237
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,730
知道911发生时我做了什么吗
You know what I did when 9/11 happened?

238
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,270
我加入了空军  因为我想为国尽忠
I joined the Air Force because I wanted to serve my country,

239
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,720
就像我祖父那样
just like my grandfather did

240
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,610
他当年就在这个码头登上了一艘运输舰
when he boarded a transport ship on this very dock

241
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,720
前往太平洋  与日本人作战
and sailed to the Pacific to fight the Japanese.

242
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,620
等我的孩子长大了
When my children grow up...

243
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,080
查理和莉莉
Charlie and Lily...

244
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,010
我希望我能看着他们的眼睛
I wanna be able to... to look them in the eye...

245
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,130
告诉他们  我曾为你们而战
and tell them that I fought for you.

246
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,410
我曾为你们的未来而战
I fought for your future.

247
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,730
在我看来  那个未来很明确
And to me, that future is clear.

248
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,560
就是小政府  减税收
Less government, less taxes,

249
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,170
更加自由  保护自由
more freedom, protect that freedom!

250
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,330
非常感谢  谢谢  谢谢
Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.

251
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,900
州长  能否说说您和搜索引擎
Governor, can you comment on your relationship

252
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,680
波利跳的关系
with the search engine Pollyhop?

253
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,480
波利跳是否真的在向您提供选民数据
Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?

254
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,000
-马上把格兰特叫来  -他好像在加州
- I want Grant here, right away. - Uh, he's in California I think.

255
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,840
他有两架私人飞机  选一架飞过来
He's got two Gulf Streams. Have him pick one.

256
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,240
非常感谢  谢谢你  保重
Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you, take care.

257
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,050
波利跳是否真的在向您提供选民数据
Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?

258
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,440
-提问被人拍下了  -他回应了吗
- The question was caught on camera. - Did he answer it?

259
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,760
没有  网上已经有很多关注了
No. It's getting a lot of traction online.

260
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,240
到早上应该报道满天飞了
Should be all over the news by morning.

261
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,230
让赛斯把目前为止的报道和简报都拿给我
Have Seth send me all the stories and clips so far.

262
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,990
我觉得我现在不需要去见莉安的人
I don't think I have to meet LeAnn's guy now.

263
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,030
-A计划会好使的  -不不
- Plan A's gonna work. - No, no, no.

264
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,620
去见他  这并不能定下来什么
Meet with him. Look, it doesn't commit us to anything.

265
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,790
-先生  -听着  我跟你一样也不想走这条路
- Sir- - Look, I don't wanna go down this route any more than you do,

266
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,830
但至少也算面面俱到了
but at least we'll have our bases covered.

267
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,310
是  先生
Yes, sir.

268
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,530
想象一个决斗在我和康威之间展开
Imagine a duel. Me and Conway.

269
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,650
康威有一把厉害的枪  一个搜索引擎
Now, Conway has a powerful gun, a search engine.

270
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,130
之所以厉害  是因为靠它
And it's powerful because with it,

271
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,910
他就能知道你在想什么  你想要什么
he can tell what you think, what you want,

272
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,660
你在哪  你是谁
where you are and who you are.

273
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,100
他可以把这些搜索都变成票
He can turn all those searches into votes,

274
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,190
这些子弹足够打死我的胜算
and that's enough bullets to kill my chances of winning.

275
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,030
但我有把更大的枪  叫做国家安全局
But I have an even bigger gun. It's called the NSA.

276
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,740
这就是做总统的优势之一
It's one of the perks of being president.

277
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,400
如果法庭批准我进行监控的话
That is, if the courts allow my surveillance request.

278
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,340
我猜挂在这墙上的男人
I imagine the men hanging on these walls

279
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,380
也希望他们当时有那样的一把枪
wished they'd had a gun like that available to them.

280
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,180
你的手机  你身旁那个人的手机
Your phone, the phone of the person sitting next to you,

281
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,910
你邻居的手机  你认识的每个人
your neighbor's phone and everyone you know

282
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,980
和你不认识的三亿美国人
and the 300 million Americans you don't know.

283
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,660
我能看到你  我能用我所见  操纵这次选举
I can see you, and I can use what I see to rig this election.

284
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,090
当然  这样的武器
Now, of course, a weapon like that,

285
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,920
可以想见  风险有多大
well, you can imagine how risky it is.

286
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,760
可能他那样的老坏蛋都会觉得犹豫呢
Huh, it might have even given pause to an old crook like him.

287
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,600
就因为监听了水门大厦的
I mean, they roasted him on the spit

288
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,020
几个房间  他就被人吊打
for tapping into a few rooms at the Watergate.

289
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,010
我可是要监听每一个美国家庭
I'm talking about tapping into every single home in America.

290
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,440
这样的武器  有可能在我手中爆炸
And a weapon like that could blow up in my hand

291
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,700
所以这是B计划  A计划要安全得多
and that's why it's plan B. Plan A is much safer.

292
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,110
曝光康威在违法使用他的枪
Expose that Conway is using his gun illegally

293
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,220
将他的武器从他手中夺下
and remove the weapon from his hand.

294
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,180
我们三个都挨过子弹
All three of us took bullets.

295
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,070
我知道我们为什么要笑  我们活下来了
Well, I know why we're smiling. We survived.

296
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,830
艾丹  这位是道格·斯坦普
Aidan. This is Doug Stamper.

297
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,170
嗯  我知道他是谁
Yeah, I know who he is.

298
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,370
为什么找我来
Tell me why I'm here.

299
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,630
国内监控  我们要赢下一场选举
Domestic surveillance. We need to win an election.

300
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,320
-你认真的吗  -如果是呢
- You serious? - What if we were?

301
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,120
国安局
The NSA...

302
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,660
-你愿冒这样的险  -如果你值得信任
- You'd take that risk? - If you can be trusted.

303
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,580
你的每一条理论
Every theory you have ever had,

304
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,520
你想检验的一切
everything you have ever wanted to test.

305
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,200
作为回报  你得到什么
And in return, you get what?

306
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,550
选民数据  好知道该针对谁
Voter data? So you know who to target?

307
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,240
以及如何找到他们  影响他们
And how to target them, to influence them.

308
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,930
给他们洗脑吗
To brainwash them?

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,430
这是为了康威  波利跳的事
Oh, this is about Conway, the Pollyhop thing.

310
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,640
-我就不该告诉你的  -我们是在浪费时间吗
- I never should've told you that. - Are we wasting our time?

311
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,130
我不能安排任何人去做
I couldn't put a single person on this.

312
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
-不  这太危险  -谈话结束
- No. It's radioactive. - We're done.

313
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,730
-到此为止  -要怎么做啊
- This is over. - How would this even work?

314
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,590
获得主干网权限...
To get backbone access requires--

315
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,190
我们在争取一个外国情报监视法判决  反恐
We're getting a FISA ruling, counter-terrorism.

316
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,700
我从未在国安局中过标
I've never won a bid from the NSA--

317
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,580
-莉安  我们走吧  -你能赢
- LeAnn, let's go. - You'd win the bid.

318
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,120
这就是你想要的  艾丹
This is what you want, Aidan.

319
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,230
老天
Jesus.

320
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,940
你来是想看能不能信任我
You came here to see if you can trust me.

321
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,690
我怎么知道我能信任你
How do I know I can trust you?

322
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,910
我不在乎你是不是信任我
I don't care whether you trust me or not.

323
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,320
但如果我们走上这条路
But if we go down this road,

324
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,150
万一出事  你得背锅
you take the fall if anything goes wrong.

325
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,790
不是我们  不是总统  是你
Not us, not the president. You.

326
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,410
只能这样
It's the only way this works.

327
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,310
告诉我你觉得是不是值得
So you tell me if you think it's worth it.

328
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,160
价值
The worth.

329
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,610
你根本不了解
You have no idea.

330
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,010
多谢你能来
Thank you so much for coming.

331
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,720
-杰弗里  -州长
- Jeffrey! - Governor.

332
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,120
你怎么样  多谢你
How you doing? Thank you so much.

333
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,140
卖下了一整张桌子  你对我们太好了
Buying a whole table. I mean, you've just been so great to us.

334
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,290
为你什么都行  州长  能合个影吗
Anything for you, Governor. Can I get a photo?

335
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,290
当然
Of course.

336
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,750
你怎么样  里奇
How you doing, Rich?

337
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,840
波利跳的事是真的吗
Is this, uh, Pollyhop thing true?

338
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,530
汉娜也一起拍吧  汉娜
Let's get Hannah in this. Hannah.

339
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,820
-杰弗  -汉娜  见到你真高兴
- Oh, Jeff. - Hannah, good to see you.

340
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,120
-我也是  你怎么样  -格兰特先生来了
- Good to see you. How are you? - Mr. Grant is here.

341
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,300
我很好  你呢
I'm good, how are you?

342
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,350
杰弗里  我回头再找你  我就回来
Jeffrey, I'm gonna come find you, okay? I'll be right back.

343
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,170
-好  -我们拍吧
- Okay. - Let's do it.

344
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,070
我接到了《纽约时报》的电话
I'm getting calls from The New York Times.

345
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,280
这事现在是瞒不住了
There is no way we can keep a lid on this now.

346
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,560
我们接到了来自各方的电话
We're getting calls from everyone.

347
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,410
如果媒体真的深挖
If the media really digs their feet in,

348
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,450
别考虑公众的反应了
forget about the public response.

349
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,660
我们得担心司法部了
We need to worry about the Justice Department.

350
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,110
你说我们的做法并不违法
You said what we're doing wasn't illegal.

351
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,340
不  我说是灰色地带  不受监管
No, I said it was gray, that it's unregulated.

352
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,500
我们的数据是私有的
Our data is proprietary.

353
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,270
我们如何使用  是我们的特权
How we want to use it, it's our prerogative.

354
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,550
如果他们给分享那些数据的利益估价
If they put a value on the benefits of sharing all that data,

355
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,830
肯定要超过所有竞选经费上限
the figure would break all campaign finance caps there are.

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,570
这事怎么泄露出去的
How the fuck did this get out?

357
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,970
先生  那名记者不是我们记者团的
Sir? That reporter's not in our press pool.

358
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,610
-我们没给他认证  -那么他为谁工作
- We didn't credential him ourselves. - So, who does he work for?

359
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,570
我们还在努力查证
We're still trying to track that down.

360
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,700
把你的手机给我
Give me your phone.

361
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,190
我这就给您接通  先生
I'll connect you now, sir.

362
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,650
您在跟总统通话了
You are now on with the president.

363
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,170
我得说  我很失望
I must say, I'm disappointed.

364
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,170
我还希望我们第一次见面会是当面见呢
I was hoping the first time we met would be in person.

365
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,120
-我们见过的  -是啊  对了
- We've met before. - Oh, yes, that's right.

366
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,080
你知道我打来是为什么事  总统先生
You know why I'm calling, Mr. President.

367
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,980
不知道  但我的确读到了一些有趣的文章
No, but I have been reading some curious articles.

368
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,160
你觉得这些报道要多久就会成为主流
How long before you think it becomes mainstream?

369
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,000
你安排了那名记者
You planted that reporter.

370
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,730
我可没有  你是谬赞我了
I did not. You're giving me far more credit than I deserve.

371
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,130
如果你把司法部扯进来
If you bring the Justice Department into this,

372
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
我会在滥用职权上对你穷追猛打
I'll come down hard on you for abuse of power,

373
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,080
那对你的伤害不会少于对我的伤害
and that'll hurt you just as much as it hurts me.

374
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,000
我不用  他们跟其他人一样
I won't have to. They read the newspapers,

375
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,770
也会看报纸
just like everyone else.

376
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,820
那你最好拉住他们
Well, then you better hold them back.

377
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,300
我提醒你一下  州长
Let me remind you, Governor,

378
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,570
以防你哪天真当上了总统
in case you do become president one day,

379
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,910
司法部是自主的
the Justice Department is autonomous.

380
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,040
我干涉可是违法的
If I were to intervene, it would be illegal.

381
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
就像你抢了联邦应急管理署那次吗
Just like when you raided FEMA?

382
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,680
瞧  全国都想相信你腐败
See, the country wants to believe that you're corrupt,

383
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,050
我会画道线把你和...
and I'll draw a very clear line between you--

384
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,460
你做吧  这事闹得越大越好
Go ahead. The more volume on this, the better.

385
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,200
你提出指控  我就让媒体以事实回应
You hurl accusations, I'll let the press hurl facts.

386
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,340
但你究竟想做什么呢
But what did you really hope to achieve?

387
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,340
我觉得你浪费了时间
I think you've wasted your time.

388
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,200
你真有筹码的时候该打给我的
You should have called me when you had some actual leverage.

389
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,060
但我得说  听到你如此激动真是令人喜出望外
But I must say, it is a treat to hear you so worked up.

390
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,560
多谢了
I do thank you for that.

391
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,910
"华盛顿  杰弗逊  林肯
"Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.

392
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,240
高个子能当好总统"  我们初遇时你对我说的
Tall men make good presidents." You said that when we first met.

393
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,750
是的  我记得
Yes, I remember what I said.

394
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,140
你当时怕了
You were intimidated.

395
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,090
我并不低估你  州长  但怕你
I don't underestimate you, Governor. But intimidated?

396
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,040
光是海拔和自大可不足以让我害怕
Takes a lot more than height and arrogance to intimidate me.

397
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,960
你赶快回你的律师身边吧
You better get back to all your lawyers.

398
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,650
罗马将军苏拉
When the Roman general Sulla,

399
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,750
大约我现在这年纪时
who was about the same age I am now,

400
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,660
向罗马进军  清除城内叛军
marched on Rome to purge the city of usurpers,

401
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,260
当时血流成河
it was a bloodbath.

402
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,550
他最大的对手是一个叫马吕斯的年轻人
His greatest rival was a young man named Marius,

403
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,450
才26岁
who was just 26 years old.

404
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,090
苏拉杀了他之后
And after Sulla had him killed,

405
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,190
他在广场上举起了他的头
he held up his head in the forum

406
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,640
盯着男孩无光的眼睛说
and looked into the boy's dead eyes

407
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,840
"首先  你得学会摇桨
and said, "First, you must learn to pull an oar.

408
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,700
然后才能掌舵"
Only then can you take the helm."

409
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,500
高压110  低压80  不赖嘛
110 over 80. Not bad.

410
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,280
威尔
Will.

411
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,300
我打给了总统
I called the president.

412
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,570
是个错误
It was a mistake.

413
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,460
好吧
Okay.

414
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:09,440
听着  我们回楼上去
Look, um... why don't we go back upstairs

415
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,390
筹点钱吧
and collect some money?

416
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,800
好吗  大家都想见你
Okay? Everyone wants to see you.

417
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,990
-走吧  -你会想出对策的
- Let's go. - You'll figure it out.

418
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,490
康威打来了  想跟我做交易
Conway called. He wanted to make a deal.

419
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,790
肯定很有意思吧
I'm sure that was enjoyable.

420
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,970
等司法部插手了
It will be even more so

421
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,420
会更有意思的
once the Justice Department gets involved.

422
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,810
那是...
Is that the, uh...

423
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,950
同款  不是同一个
Same model. Not the actual one.

424
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,040
-特勤局居然允许...  -那个
- Surprised the Secret Service let - Well,

425
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,310
他们拔了撞针
they removed the firing pin.

426
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,000
比我想的要轻
It's lighter than I imagined.

427
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,620
这么小的东西居然能造成那么大的伤害
It's amazing something this small could do that much damage.

428
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,420
我本想明天带上的
I was gonna bring it tomorrow,

429
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,880
但或许太戏剧化了
but I think it might be too theatrical.

430
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,250
要我帮你练习吗
You want me to help you practice?

431
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,540
好
All right.

432
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,230
早上好  安德伍德夫人
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

433
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,420
早上好  梅尔曼女士
Good morning, Ms. Melman.

434
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,080
-不  她叫什么  -茱莉亚
- No, what's her first name? - Julia.

435
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,740
-叫这个  -我们不认识
- Use that. - We've never met before.

436
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,150
让她知道第一夫人是谁
Remind her who the First Lady is.

437
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,480
早上好  茱莉亚
Good morning, Julia.

438
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,030
早上好  安德伍德夫人
Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

439
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,490
请坐吧
Please, have a seat.

440
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,520
我们想有包容性
We want to be inclusive.

441
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,610
我们希望全国步枪协会与我们合作让法案通过
We'd like the NRA to work with us on getting this bill passed.

442
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,670
我们在两党都广受支持
We have major support on both sides of the aisle.

443
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,080
那是现在  但今后未必
Well, you do for now, but not for long.

444
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,100
即便是20个孩子死于校园枪击
You can have 20 kids massacred in a school shooting.

445
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,990
公众会愤怒呼吁枪支改革
There's always the usual public outcry, demands for gun reform.

446
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,610
但几个月后  人们就会忘记
But a few months go by and people forget.

447
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,450
这份法案会迅速通过国会
Well, this will move through Congress quickly.

448
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,110
我们在两党都广受支持
We've got major support on both sides of the aisle.

449
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,850
那也不足以抵抗阻挠议事
Not enough to break a filibuster.

450
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,850
我们会把此事拖到大选
We'll drag this out till the election.

451
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,900
我们会阻挠参议院其他所有的法案
We'll tie up every other bill in the Senate.

452
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,450
我跟很多参议员谈过  他们...
Well, I've spoken to a lot of Senators and they--

453
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,160
不  别跟她纠缠那个
No, don't get bogged down there.

454
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,800
把重点直接戳到最高法院
Pivot right to the Supreme Court.

455
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,750
你打算连最高法院提名也拖延吗
You plan on holding up the Supreme Court nomination, as well?

456
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,950
除非你打算提名一位全国步枪协会的成员
Unless you're going to nominate an NRA member.

457
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,760
-你知道那不可能  -雅各布斯不好预测
- You know we can't do that. - Jacobs was unpredictable.

458
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,470
这次我们不会冒险了
This time we're not taking any chances.

459
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,530
如果你让政府停摆
If you bring the government to a standstill,

460
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,720
我们就把全国步枪协会作为选举重点
we're gonna make this election about the NRA.

461
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,690
你拼不过一个亿的广告
You can't match $100 million in ad buys.

462
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,750
去吧  把你的钱都浪费掉吧
Go for it. Flush your money down the drain.

463
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,460
民主党数十年前就输了这场仗了
The Democrats lost that battle decades ago.

464
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,480
你还会再输一次
And you'll lose it again.

465
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,140
总统任党鞭时未提出过一项枪支改革法案
The president never offered up one gun reform bill while he was whip.

466
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,870
因为那当时并非他的首要考虑
Well, because it wasn't a top priority for him--

467
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,870
不不不  更强势点
No, no, no, no, no. Make it, uh, stronger.

468
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,510
比如  "总统挨了颗子弹"  弄成私事
Say, uh, "The president took a bullet!" Make it personal.

469
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,950
我对您丈夫遭枪击感到遗憾
I'm sorry your husband got shot.

470
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,150
但不至于因此妥协
But not enough to roll over.

471
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,840
我们不是叫你妥协
Oh, we're not asking you to.

472
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:22,980
我们是希望你站在历史正确的一方
We're inviting you to be on the right side of history.

473
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,660
这不错  但你得拿出致命的招数
Yeah, that's good, but you wanna go in for the kill.

474
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,230
我们要这女人气得夺门而出
We want this woman storming out of that door,

475
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,810
口吐白沫
foaming at the mouth.

476
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,660
好吧  别丢人了  茱莉亚
All right. Don't disgrace yourself, Julia.

477
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,340
-想想未来  -不  再强硬点
- Think about the future- - No, tougher.

478
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,950
再狠点  再强硬点
Stronger, tougher!

479
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,010
好吧  那这样如何
All right, what about...

480
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,920
三十年后  当你接受临终护理  奄奄一息时
Thirty years from now when you're dying in hospice care...

481
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,910
你可以回首人生  为你拯救的生命而自豪
you can look back and be proud of all the lives you saved.

482
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,020
也可以被历史遗忘
Or you can be forgotten...

483
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,910
用你冰冷僵硬的双手紧紧抓住过去
clutching onto the past with your cold, dead hands.

484
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,920
我自己出去吧
I'll show myself out.

485
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,720
这就是我说的那份勇气
That's exactly the steel goddamn stomach I was talking about.

486
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,900
是皮特·德雷尔吗
Was it Pete Dreyer?

487
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,650
德雷尔议员是我多年的导师
Congressman Dreyer's been a mentor for years.

488
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,890
-他无权告诉你  -他完全有权
- He had no right to tell you. - He had every right.

489
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,780
如果众议院情报委员会的成员
If a member of the House Intelligence Committee

490
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,290
决定对我透露情报  他有这个权利
chooses to share information with me, he's at liberty to do so.

491
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,350
我们的谈话是私下的
Our conversation was in confidence.

492
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,610
这让我很不舒服
I don't feel comfortable with this.

493
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,040
议员跟你一样觉得不满
The Congressman is just as frustrated as you are,

494
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,330
他找到我是因为想帮忙
and he spoke to me because he wants to help.

495
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,260
我也想帮忙  将军
And so do I, General.

496
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,300
州长  我是名士兵  我不玩政治
Governor, I'm a soldier. I'm not going to play politics.

497
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,940
你对皮特开口的时候就是在玩政治了
You played politics the moment you opened your mouth to Pete.

498
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,740
-你看到我昨天的讲话了吗  -是的
- Did you see my speech yesterday? - Yes, I did.

499
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,920
我都是真心的
I meant every word of it.

500
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,760
你我都曾为我们国家而战
Now, you and I have both fought for our country.

501
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,370
安德伍德可没有
Underwood hasn't.

502
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,810
他根本不懂  不能理解
He has no idea. He doesn't understand.

503
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,770
所以我得当上总统
And that's why I need to be president,

504
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,680
这样我们才能在需要的时候出击
so we can strike when we need to strike.

505
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,790
听着  我可以帮你  但我需要你的帮助
Look, I can help you, but I need your help to do so.

506
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,590
我从未向媒体透露过机密信息  从没有过
I've never leaked classified information to the press. Not once.

507
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,810
我的同事干过  我没有过
My colleagues have. I haven't.

508
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,120
有个更好的办法
There's a better way.

509
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,270
你起初会觉得不太好
You're not gonna like the sound of this at first,

510
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,330
但听我说完  我们是可以回击的
but if you hear me out, we can fight back on this.

511
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,130
-将军  -总统先生
- General. - Mr. President.

512
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,880
收回去吧  我不接受你的辞职
You can take this back. I am not accepting your resignation.

513
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
请坐
Please, sit.

514
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,160
我曾在黎巴嫩作战  先生
I fought in Lebanon, sir.

515
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,200
在索马里  波斯尼亚
Commanded troops in Somalia,

516
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,970
两次海湾战争和阿富汗带过兵
in Bosnia, in both Gulf Wars, in Afghanistan.

517
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,080
我不希望我们再在那样的冲突中陷入困境
I just don't wanna see us bogged down in another conflict like those.

518
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,980
哈里发国就是下一个基地组织和塔利班
ICO is the next Al Qaeda and Taliban.

519
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,840
而你辞职不会有任何用
And you accomplish nothing by resigning your commission.

520
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,760
您现在的政策才是毫无用处
We've accomplished nothing with your current policy.

521
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,560
我不禁觉得
You know, I just can't help but think that...

522
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,990
这时机  太巧了
the timing of this, it's just a bit coincidental.

523
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,530
-什么  -康威昨天发表了一番高谈阔论
- Sir? - Well, Conway gave a big speech yesterday.

524
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,380
他把哈里发国吹得很大  是吧
I mean, he made a big meal out of ICO, didn't he?

525
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,990
他应该是意识到了他们多么危险
I suppose he realizes just how dangerous they are.

526
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,130
不知这情报他是从哪得来的
I wonder where he's getting that information.

527
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,640
我不知道  先生
I've no idea, sir.

528
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,720
我从未跟他说过话  我也不会那么做
I've never spoken to the man, nor would I.

529
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,980
那是机密
It's classified.

530
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,020
那么你的话是发自良心
And you're speaking from your conscience.

531
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,610
是  先生
Yes, sir.

532
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,520
良心有种标志性的臭味儿
Conscience has an unmistakable stink to it,

533
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,260
就像生洋葱和早上的口臭
sort of like raw onions and morning breath.

534
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,770
但谎言的臭味儿
But a lie stinks even more

535
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,850
从一个不习惯撒谎的人身上散发出来  格外浓烈
when it's coming from someone who isn't used to lying.

536
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,310
就像臭鸡蛋和马粪
It's more like rotten eggs and horseshit.

537
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,810
-我们多快能采取行动  -您想采取行动吗
- How soon can we move on this? - You want to conduct the mission?

538
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,860
这能避免你辞职吗
Would it keep you from resigning?

539
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,700
我...
Well, I--

540
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,390
我需要你的专业知识和经验
I need your expertise and your experience,

541
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,480
如果两者都告诉我我错了
and if both are telling me I'm wrong,

542
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,050
那么比起我自己  我更相信你的直觉
I'd rather trust your instincts than mine.

543
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,530
现在还有机会吗
Do we still have an open window?

544
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,660
集会将于明晚结束
The gathering is set to end by tomorrow night.

545
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,550
我先去跟参联会主席和国防部长谈谈
Let me talk to the Chairman and the Secretary of Defense

546
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,000
-然后再签署命令  -当然  先生
- before I sign off on the order. - Of course, sir.

547
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,100
将军  跟总统针锋相对  真是勇敢
General, it takes a brave man to stand up to a president.

548
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,860
如果您批准行动  我们就拿不到裁决了
If you authorize the mission, we won't get our court ruling.

549
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,420
哈里发国如果被消灭
There is no way to justify

550
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,650
就不能作为国内监控的理由了
domestic surveillance once ICO is eliminated.

551
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,520
这没关系  媒体压力越来越大
Which is fine, because media pressure is mounting.

552
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,280
康威别无选择  只能跟波利跳撇清关系
Conway has no choice but to distance himself from Pollyhop.

553
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,290
我们不知道结局会如何
We don't know how that's gonna play out.

554
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,580
我可以告诉你们布洛哈特的辞职结局会如何
Oh, I can tell you how Brockhart's resignation is gonna play out.

555
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,860
每个摇摆州30秒的广告
Thirty-second ads in every swing state.

556
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,260
一位功勋卓著的老兵
A decorated war veteran

557
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,850
痛击我们不重视国家安全
pulverizing us for being weak on national security.

558
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,740
波利跳对我们的打击会远胜于布洛哈特
Pollyhop is gonna pulverize us more than Brockhart ever could.

559
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,090
如果康威要忙着应付公众批评就不会了
Not if Conway is busy fighting public outcry.

560
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,140
想想他们已经收集到的数据
Think about the data they have already gathered.

561
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,040
你向我们提出时  说这是没办法的办法
When you sold us this, you said it was going to be a last resort,

562
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,360
而非唯一的办法
not the only resort.

563
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,170
获得监控批准毫无风险
There is no risk in getting surveillance approved.

564
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,850
然后我们要么用  要么不用
Then we either use it or we don't.

565
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,130
但如果您下令打击  先生  我们就没选择了
But if you order this strike, sir, we don't even have the option.

566
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,400
-你见过麦卡伦了  -是  先生
- You've met with him, Macallan. - Yes, sir.

567
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,410
-他值得信任吗  -我真说不准
- So, can he be trusted? - I honestly can't say.

568
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,800
他比您更明白其中的风险
He understands the risks even better than you do.

569
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,720
-我要下令打击  -先生
- I'm gonna authorize the strike. - Sir...

570
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,100
你的人是无名小卒
Your guy's an unknown.

571
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,830
-布洛哈特可不是  -夫人
- Brockhart isn't. - Ma'am...

572
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,680
-我支持弗兰西斯  -给我接国防部长
- I agree with Francis. - Get me the Secretary of Defense.

573
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,600
我叫克莱尔今天一起来
I've asked Claire to join us today

574
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,740
因为这直接与她
because this directly affects

575
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,240
想要通过的法律相关
the legislation she's trying to get passed.

576
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,240
你们竞选搭档的三个首选
Your top three choices for running mate,

577
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,260
都是反对枪支管制说客的朋友
they're all tight with the gun lobby.

578
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,120
安德伍德夫人
Mrs. Underwood...

579
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,650
你知道这屋里的人都赞同你想要的改革
You know everyone in this room agrees with the reforms you want,

580
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,810
但我们要考虑大选
but we're thinking about the general election,

581
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,390
而跟全国步枪协会交恶可很不明智
and the NRA is a terrible enemy for us to make.

582
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,800
惠特克会关注摇摆州  筹款
Yeah, now Whittaker's gonna focus on swing states, fundraising...

583
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,520
这时我就唱白脸
That's where I'll play the bad cop.

584
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,910
而你唱脸更白的  等我们打乱了他们的阵脚
You play the worse cop. Then when we get them off balance...

585
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,210
你就再重新唱起红脸
You come back in again as the good cop.

586
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,790
没错  所以我就先说
Exactly. So I will start with...

587
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:42,040
我觉得这些选择发出的讯息很混乱
Well, I feel that these choices send mixed messages.

588
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,760
我们支持枪支改革  他们不支持
We're for gun reform, they're not.

589
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,580
如果竞选搭档两个人都是狂热的枪支管制支持者
If both names on the ticket are gun-control fanatics,

590
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,230
那整个竞选的重点就成了
then the whole election becomes about...

591
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,580
说私事  就像你让我对付梅尔曼那样
Get personal, the way you told me to with Melman.

592
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,960
四个总统里就有一个遭过枪击
One out of four presidents gets shot at.

593
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,590
十个总统里有一个死于枪伤
One out of every ten dies from a bullet wound.

594
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,890
再强势点
Better than that.

595
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,290
我看着艾德华·密查姆就死在我眼前
I saw Edward Meechum die before my very eyes.

596
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,800
-很好  你很幸运  -我很幸运
- Good. You were lucky. - I'm lucky.

597
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,510
数据对这些人来说毫无意义
Statistics don't mean anything to these people.

598
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,430
他们认为这条路只会通往没收
They see this as a one-way road to confiscation.

599
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,830
如果我选择这样的立场会立刻失去席位
I lose my seat in a heartbeat if I take this stance.

600
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,970
-现在我要唱红脸了  -好  博奇说
- Now, this is where I will play good cop. - Okay, so Birch goes,

601
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,760
"我们希望您能考虑全局  总统先生"
"We're asking you to look at the bigger picture here, Mr. President."

602
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,110
你说得对  鲍勃
You're right, Bob.

603
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,740
-克莱尔  -他们说得都对
- Claire! - They're all right. They are.

604
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,100
我跟全国步枪协会的见面并不顺利
My meeting with the NRA did not go well.

605
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,720
他们打算全力以赴地阻挠此事
They're going to fight this tooth and nail.

606
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,060
当然了
Well, of course they are.

607
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,800
而且这项法案很可能不会通过
And... and the chances are the legislation won't pass.

608
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,030
会通过的  因为你们要让法案
Oh, it'll pass. Because you are going to push it

609
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,370
通过参众两院  成为立法
until it goes through both houses and gets on the books.

610
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,720
我们现在虽然获得支持
We may have support now...

611
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,600
但等法案进行表决的时候
But by the time this bill gets onto the floor...

612
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,680
你就专注于法案措辞吧  议员
You focus on the language, Congressman.

613
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,230
把说服美国人民交给我们
Leave convincing the American people to us.

614
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,250
如果你愿意在法案上与我们合作
Now, if you wanna work with us on this bill,

615
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,430
我就能容忍一个爱枪的候选人
I can stomach a gun-friendly candidate.

616
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,120
你呢  弗兰西斯
What about you, Francis?

617
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,930
致命杀
The kill.

618
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,520
只有一个条件  克莱尔
Only on one condition, Claire.

619
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,200
我不希望我们为法案通过忙里忙外
I don't want us to work our asses off getting this bill passed

620
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,490
却在法院被否决
just to see it knocked down in the courts.

621
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,250
这事我们无从控制  先生
We don't have any control over that, sir.

622
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,220
我们还得找人接替雅各布斯呢
We still need to fill Jacobs' seat.

623
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,070
如果你能找到反枪法官
If you can confirm an anti-gun justice,

624
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,470
我就让爱枪人士做竞选搭档
I'll put a gun-lover on the ticket.

625
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,090
大选期间确认最高法院提名
A Supreme Court confirmation in the middle of an election?

626
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,350
拜托  有点胆子  鲍勃
Oh, come on, grow a pair, Bob.

627
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,620
我们都随你的心了  也满足我们一下嘛
We're giving you what you want. Give us what we want.

628
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,680
你在考虑谁
Who are you thinking about?

629
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,640
没人跟你来吧
Nobody followed you?

630
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,310
没人  我确定
No one. I'm positive.

631
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,120
有时候我会觉得我的学生不对劲
You know, sometimes I have a student and something seems off.

632
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,460
上大学有点太老了  知道吗
They look a little too old, you know? To be in college.

633
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,810
-那是什么  -阿普唑仑[镇静剂]
- What is that? - Xanax.

634
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,460
卢卡斯来过
Lucas came up here.

635
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,020
来校园
To the campus.

636
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,340
他求我帮忙  我拒绝了
He wanted my help and I said no.

637
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,410
如果我答应了  或许他...
Maybe if I had, he wouldn't have...

638
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,710
太傻了
So stupid.

639
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,810
他出来了
He got out.

640
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,600
为什么要那么做
Why did he do this?

641
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,740
这就是我想查明的
That's what I'm trying to find out.

642
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,360
都是真的  汤姆
It's all true, Tom.

643
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,750
-你怎么知道  -我就是知道
- How do you know? - Because I know.

644
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,640
卢卡斯没在遗书中提到你
Lucas didn't mention you in his suicide letter.

645
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,910
肯定是为了保护我
I'm sure it was to protect me.

646
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,340
如果你有任何证据  现在就该拿出来了
If you have any proof, now's the time to share it.

647
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,300
如果我有  你觉得还会发生这样的事吗
If I did, do you think any of this would've happened?

648
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,290
-你可以公开声明  -我签了宣誓书
- You could go on record- - I signed an affidavit.

649
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,180
我现在说什么都一文不值了
Anything I say now is worth shit.

650
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,170
或许就因为这个他们才没再来找我
That's probably why they've left me alone.

651
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,800
不不  别再吃药了
No, no. No. No more pills.

652
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,730
-答应我你会小心  -我保证
- Promise me you'll be careful. - I promise.

653
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,240
如果可以帮忙  我会的
I would help if I could, I--

654
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,570
你就好好照顾自己就行
You just focus on taking care of yourself.

655
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,730
过来  过来
Come here. Come here.

656
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,430
我能说服你改主意吗
Is there anything I can do to make you reconsider?

657
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,380
是  先生  我理解
Yes, sir, I understand.

658
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,170
我也对发动打击感到高兴
I'm pleased the strike's on, as well.

659
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,390
多谢提醒  再见
Thank you for the heads up. Bye.

660
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,240
该死
Fuck!

661
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,070
-怎么了  -他屈服了
- What's wrong? - He caved.

662
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,190
-将军吗  -是的
- The general? - Yes.

663
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,830
爸爸  什么时候开始
Daddy, when is it?

664
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,420
什么时候开始  本
When is it? Ben?

665
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,380
我对这个没把握  威尔  或许我们该取消
I'm not sure about this, Will. Maybe we should cancel it.

666
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,330
我的律师认为这主意糟透了
My lawyers are saying it's a terrible idea.

667
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,390
不是我们  就是司法部
If it's not us, it's the Justice Department.

668
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,500
-我为公司投入了一切  -相信我吧
- I've put everything into this company. - Just trust me on this.

669
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,500
威尔
Hey, Will.

670
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,470
-往我图片分享上放  -嗯
- For my Insta. - Yeah.

671
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,530
笑一个查理
Okay. Smile, Charlie.

672
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,810
笑吧
Smile.

673
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,440
-好了  -真棒
- All right. - Great.

674
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,560
好了
Here we go.

675
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,360
你个小家伙
You little...

676
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,800
过去
Scoot over.

677
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,240
都好了吗
Are we all set?

678
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,810
是的  先生  就等你了
Yes, sir. Ready whenever you are.

679
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,690
开始喽
Here we go.

680
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,370
好
Okay.

681
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,870
准备好了吗  准备好了吗
You ready? You ready?

682
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,570
嗯
Yep.

683
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,300
开始了
Here we go.

684
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,130
美国  你们好  我是威尔·康威
Hello, America. I'm Will Conway,

685
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,040
共和党总统候选人
Republican candidate for president,

686
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,070
这是我儿子查理
and this is my son, Charlie.

687
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,690
跟大家打个招呼啊  查理
You wanna say hi to everyone, Charlie?

688
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,060
打个招呼  打个招呼吧
A little hi. Can we get a little hi?

689
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,500
不吗  就这样了  就这样了
No? That's all we get? That's all we get.

690
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:15,000
这是我妻子汉娜  我们的小淘气莉莉
And this is Hannah, my wife. And our little rascal Lily.

691
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,800
她已经不小了
Well, she's not so little anymore,

692
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,200
但绝对还是个小淘气
but definitely still a rascal.

693
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,410
是吧  亲爱的
Aren't you, sweetheart?

694
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,170
我们正在我们奥尔巴尼的家中进行网络直播
And we are webcasting from our home here in Albany.

695
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:28,540
大家可以看到  我们不住在州长府
As you can see, we don't live in the governor's mansion.

696
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,630
我们跟你们很多人一样  住在普通的民居中
We live in a regular house, just like many of you.

697
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,070
这是我们的起居室
And this is our living room.

698
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,500
一切都是汉娜自己装修的
Hannah has decorated everything herself.

699
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,080
除了玩具
Well, except for the toys.

700
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,420
那是孩子们添加的装饰
That's the... That's the kids' addition to the decor.

701
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,920
好多玩具
A lot of toys.

702
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,460
你们很多人都在新闻中看到或听说了
Now, many of you have seen or read in the news

703
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,090
关于我们竞选团队跟搜索引擎波利跳合作的传言
rumors about my campaign teaming up with the search engine Pollyhop,

704
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,430
我今天想跟大家谈谈这些传言
and I'd like to speak to you today about those rumors

705
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,490
因为那根本不是传言
because they're not rumors at all.

706
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,520
是事实  绝对真实
They're facts. One hundred percent accurate.

707
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,390
这位是我的好朋友本杰明·格兰特
And here is my good friend Benjamin Grant.

708
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,440
他是波利跳的创始人
He's the founder of Pollyhop,

709
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,100
他会跟大家讲讲我们的合作
and he's gonna tell you about our partnership.

710
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,790
很多大公司都不参与政治
Well, a lot of big companies stay out of politics.

711
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,380
他们不想得罪人  但波利跳不是如此
They don't want to offend anyone. But not Pollyhop.

712
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,290
我们不遮掩我们的政治立场
We're not shy about who we support,

713
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,630
我们很骄傲能支持威尔·康威
and we're proud to support Will Conway.

714
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,940
他知道这个国家需要什么  将走向何方
He knows what this country needs and where it's going.

715
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,260
好了
Now...

716
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,870
我知道这可能会吓到很多人
I realize this might scare a lot of people.

717
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,600
我们是否知道你的私人信息
Do we know your personal information?

718
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,570
我们是否能看到你们搜索了什么
Can we see what you're searching for?

719
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,870
我们是否在读你们的邮件
Are we reading your emails?

720
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,310
答案是否定的  我们并未追踪个人
The answer is no. We're not tracking individuals.

721
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,970
我们要的是元数据
We're looking at metadata,

722
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,660
宏观浏览规律  搜索潮流  地域特征
large-scale browsing patterns, search trends, regional portraits.

723
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,200
因为本是对的
'Cause Ben is right.

724
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,090
一位总统应该了解他的选区
A president should know his constituents.

725
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,170
而网络是了解的最佳工具
And the Internet is the best tool for that.

726
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,800
我见过数千人  跟很多人握过手
Now, I've met thousands of people and shaken a lot of hands,

727
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,630
但我不可能跟每个人见面
but I can't meet everyone.

728
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,210
这就是我倾听数百万人心声的办法
So this is my way of listening to millions of you.

729
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,360
如果我了解了你们
Now, it's only fair if I get to know you better,

730
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,080
那么你们也该了解我
you should get to know me better.

731
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,480
所以我虽然没有读你们的私人信件
So while I'm not reading your personal correspondence,

732
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,110
我希望你们能查看我的
I want you to have access to mine.

733
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,200
从今日起
So, from this point forward,

734
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,950
我通过这部手机发的邮件  短信
every email, text message, photo, or video

735
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,630
拍摄的照片和视频
that I use on this phone,

736
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,050
你们都能看到  包括我当上州长后的一切
you can see it all, including everything since I became governor.

737
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,480
你们只需要登录我的竞选网站  网址是
Now, all you have to do is go into my campaign website at...

738
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,120

739
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,420
没错  你就能看到链接
That's correct. And you'll find a link right there.

740
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,530
我们的生活就是你的生活
Our life is your life.

741
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,260
你的未来是我们的未来
And your future is our future.

742
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,110
谢谢  天佑美国
Thank you, and God bless America.

743
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,650
-真不错  -是啊  不错
- That was good. - Yeah, that was good.

744
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,220
干得好  干得好
Well done. Well done.

745
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,750
不客气  州长
You got it, Governor.

746
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,570
好了  我们拭目以待吧
All right. Now we wait and see.

747
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,470
他的诚实和坦诚造成了不小的影响
His honesty and openness have made quite an impact,

748
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,410
美国也竖起了耳朵
and America is paying attention.

749
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,700
康威网络直播后三小时内
Just three hours since Conway's webcast,

750
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,300
就有超过两百万人登录了他的网站

751
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,570
公众的广泛关注让波利跳点击量暴增
The massive public interest has driven traffic to Pollyhop.Com.

752
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,470
波利跳执行总裁本杰明·格兰特
Pollyhop CEO Benjamin Grant

753
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,310
称搜索量达到了平时的三倍

754
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,630
手机视频全部上传到了康威竞选网站
All of the cell phone footage is on the Conway campaign website.

755
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,650
有超多的历史影像
There's a ton of archived clips.

756
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,380
有些已经被疯传  包括这段
Some have already gone viral, including this one,

757
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,320
就拍摄于今天早上
filmed just this morning,

758
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,000
画面中是康威和他美丽的妻子汉娜  好嫉妒啊
of Conway with his gorgeous wife Hannah, so jealous,

759
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,540
以及他萌爆的儿子查理
and his totally adorable son Charlie.

760
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,410
剃妈妈的头  别剃我的
Shave Mom's head, not mine!

761
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,140
剃妈妈的头
Shave Mom's head?

762
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,490
-好吧  -不
- Okay. - No!

763
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,460
猜对了  我还是讨厌孩子
You guessed it. I still hate children.

764
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,330
大家根本不在乎自己的隐私
People don't care about their privacy.

765
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,990
他们希望他看
They want him to have access.

766
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,340
他依然违反了竞选经费法规
He's still breaking campaign finance regulations.

767
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,630
但他得到的报道都是正面的
But he's getting good press,

768
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,280
而不是我们所期望的民愤
not the public outcry we had hoped for.

769
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,440
您不能让司法部调查
You can't let the Justice Department investigate.

770
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,020
只会适得其反
It'll backfire on us.

771
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,310
您得取消空袭
What you need to do is call off the air strike.

772
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,660
先生  您已经签署了命令
Sir, you've already signed the order.

773
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,950
飞机都升空了
We've got planes in the air.

774
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,070
我的工作是赢下竞选  我得...
My job is to win a campaign, I need to have--

775
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,730
-我的工作是保护总统  -够了
- And my job is to protect the president. - Enough!

776
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,400
老天爷
Jesus Christ.

777
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,170
走吧  我得跟他谈谈
Go. I need to speak with him.

778
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,230
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

779
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,540
当它只是B计划时我还能接受
That I was fine with this when it was just plan B,

780
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,450
但这是国内监控
but this is... domestic surveillance.

781
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,470
我们都不认识这人
I mean, we don't even know this guy.

782
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,040
你说得对  我们不认识他  但我们知道
You're right, we don't know him. What we do know...

783
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,860
如果不采取措施  我们会输
is we'll lose if we do nothing.

784
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,910
他们真美  是吧  康威夫妇
They're beautiful, aren't they? The Conways.

785
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,630
他们的青春  他们的两个孩子
Their youth, their two little children.

786
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,220
这国家爱上了他们
The country is falling in love with them.

787
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,660
他们不会那样爱我们的
They won't fall in love with us like that,

788
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,730
但我们有他们没有的东西
but we have something they don't.

789
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,360
我们愿比任何人都走得更远
We are willing to go one step farther than everyone else.

790
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,510
将军  说句话
General, a word.

791
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,450
我们还有两小时...
We're approximately two hours out--

792
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,040
-中止行动  -总统先生
- Abort the mission. - Mr. President?

793
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,480
-我命令你中止  -但您说
- I'm ordering you to abort. - But you said--

794
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,530
别逼我再说一遍了  也别威胁要辞职
Don't make me say it a third time, and don't threaten to resign,

795
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,850
因为我知道你不会的
because I know you won't,

796
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,720
因为你无法想象做个平民的滋味
because you can't even fathom what it means to be a civilian.

797
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,570
-执行我的命令  -是  先生
- Execute my order. - Yes, sir.

798
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,300
-先生  -已经下令了
- Sir. - It's done.

799
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,750
-先生  -我中止了
- Sir. - I aborted.

800
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,690
这么晚不睡
You're up late.

801

Hannah's last moments of 2012.

803
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,250
够了  我在狼吞虎咽呢
Stop, I'm stuffing my face.

804
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,400
你在喂长身体的女孩嘛  小宝宝  你好啊
You're feeding a growing girl. Hello, little baby.

我以为你今晚要去时代广场呢
I thought you'd be in Times Square tonight.

820
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,320
德卢卡州长最后一年任职了
It's Governor De Luca's last year in office.

821
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,290
我觉得不该抢他的风头
I thought he should have the spotlight to himself.

822
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,650
你太有风度了
Well, that's very classy of you.

823

824
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,190
在华盛顿结交新朋友的机会

真是聪明  你见过加勒特了吗

831
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,010
贱民差不多
More like a pariah.

832
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,040
-这里有好多民主党人  -也有不少共和党人
- There's a lot of Democrats here. - Plenty of Republicans, too.

833
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,310
这是弗兰克张罗的
Frank made sure of that.

834
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,650
如果想在国会取得进展
Well, if you wanna push the sludge through Congress,

835
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,310
就得两边都有朋友
it's best to have grease on both sides of the aisle.

836
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,050
抱歉  我得走了  时间要到了
Oh, I'm sorry, I have to go. It's almost time.

838
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,010
你真是在911第二天就入伍了吗
So, is it true that you joined up a day after 9/11,

839
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,590
还是只是一种说法
or is that just something you say?

840
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,200
24小时内  对天发誓
Within 24 hours, honest to God.

841
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,480
真是了不起
That's incredible.

842
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,330
我才25  刚从法学院出来
I was 25, just out of law school.

843
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,780
想步入仕途
You want a career in politics

844
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,750
偏巧赶上双子塔的事
and the Twin Towers fall in your lap?

845
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,680
时机简直再好不过
Timing couldn't have been better.

846
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,140
我明白你是怎么获胜的了
Oh, I see how you won.

847
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,640
-他肯定像站在世界之巅  -我无法想象

Oh, really? How old are you? Thirty-five?

849
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,250
36岁
Thirty-six.

850
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,980
你夜深人静的时候从没想过吗
Oh, you've never thought about it, late at night?

851
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,020
-白宫吗  -还能是什么
- The White House? - What else?

852
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,610
-你呢  -谁没想过
- Have you? - Haven't we all?

853
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:06,050
我不急  谁知道呢  或许有一日吧
I'm in no rush. Who knows? Maybe, one day.

854
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:12,630
华盛顿  杰弗逊  林肯  高个子能当好总统
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln. Tall men make great presidents.

855
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,300
你就好像希望我竞选似的
It's like you want me to run.

856
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,800
天呐  可不  你竞选
Oh, goodness, no. You running?

857
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,280
那对民主党绝对是灾难
That would be a disaster for the Democrats.

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}2012年12月14日  康涅狄格州纽顿市发生特大枪击案
20名六七岁的小学生被枪杀
事发后奥巴马委任副总统拜登组织特别委员会
推动新枪支控制法案
但经过数月的运作  新法案仍全无机会通过国会
奥巴马大发雷霆  但也束手无策
不久前  奥巴马决定通过行政命令的方式
绕过国会  推动枪支管控
但这样的努力即使成功  影响也非常有限

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}伊斯兰国出现早期  美国政府和军事机构就向白宫做过汇报
当时奥巴马对这个恐怖组织非常轻视
认为他们是不入流的流寇  并轻蔑地讽刺说
一个中学校队队员穿上洛杉矶湖人队的队衣
也不会就变成科比·布莱恩特
目前包括曾经在奥巴马政府任职的外交专家都认为
如果奥巴马当初及时采取行动  伊斯兰国不会发展到今天这样
如此迅速地扩张成为历史上最危险的恐怖组织
不仅在中东肆虐  也不放过在欧洲和美国发动大规模袭击的机会
