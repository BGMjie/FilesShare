这样美好的上午  这样和谐的教堂
You know, it's on a morning like this, in a church like yours,

49
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,390
让我为做个南卡人骄傲

"你们有多少人开车来教堂的
"How many of you drove to church?

51
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,740
我先问各位一句
Let me start by asking,

52
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,990
今天早上你们有多少人是开车来的"
how many of you drove to church here this morning?"

53
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,080
你们今早有多少人是开车来教堂的
How many of you drove to get to church here this morning?

54
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,540
你们有多少人是拼车来的呢
And how many of you drove together?

55
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,870
我理解拼车的各位
Well, I can appreciate that.

56
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,990
这年头的油价
Gas prices right now

57
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,080
快把大家都烧穷了
are putting a strain on everybody's pocketbooks.

58
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,210
你们说对不对
Isn't that true?

59
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,540
我想加夫尼的油价尤其高
I think maybe more here in Gaffney,

60
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,830
至少我对加夫尼尤其感同身受
at least I feel it here in Gaffney more than anywhere else.

61
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,250
"尤其是在加夫尼
"Especially here in Gaffney.

62
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,980
作为总统  我觉得对此负有责任
Now, as president, I feel responsible for that.

63
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,290
或许  我对这里的责任感更强烈
Or maybe, I feel even more so here.

64
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,840
我们这里向来就不怎么富裕
You know, we've never been a rich town.

65
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,170
我小的时候常常琢磨
You know, a lot of times in my childhood, I thought to myself,

66
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,410
'为什么我们这里在世人眼中就跟空气似的呢
'Why, we just, we were almost like an invisible town to people...

67
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,870
我们无关紧要'"
We didn't matter.'"

68
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,860
我们无关紧要
That we didn't matter.

69
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,650
当然了  我还是个白人小子呢
And, of course, I was a white boy.

70
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,870
虽然我家挺穷的
And as poor as my family was,

71
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,540
但还是比在座的许多家庭宽裕不少
we still were a lot better off than a lot of your families...

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,650
你们不仅要和贫穷斗争
who not only had to struggle through poverty

73
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,570
还得和种族歧视斗争
but had to fight racism as well.

74
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,850
你们有多少人还记得1973年
Now, how many of you remember 1973?

75
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,130
"你们有多少人还记得1973年
"Now, how many of you remember 1973?

76
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,810
那年的汽油价格跟今天一样飙涨
When gas prices were as bad as they are today,

77
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,870
我们为了加油  得排队排好几里地
and we had to wait hours just to fill our tank.

78
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,350
石油输出国家组织当时想要挟我们
Why, OPEC was trying to hold us hostage then

79
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,520
就像今天  俄罗斯也想故技重施
just as Russia's trying to hold us hostage now.

80
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,400
但是不知怎地
But somehow...

81
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,030
我们这个小社区团结了起来  是不是
our little community, why, we came together, didn't we?

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,010
我们团结了起来  是不是"  是的
We came together, didn't we?" Yes.

83
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,830
我们互帮互助  同舟共济
We looked out for each other. We were there for each other.

84
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,190
也许我们对国内其他地方无关紧要
Now, maybe we didn't matter to the rest of the country,

85
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,590
但我们对彼此却至关重要
but we sure as heck mattered to each other.

86
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,600
我们还在和贫穷斗争
We're still struggling with poverty,

87
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,610
我们仍然需要和种族歧视斗争
and racism is still something we have to fight against.

88
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,480
但是我知道  这地方非常重要
But I know that this town does matter.

89
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,910
你们都非常重要
That all of you matter.

90
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,080
我这么说可不仅仅是因为非裔
And I don't just say that because African Americans

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,230
手里握着全州一半的选票
represent half the vote in this state.

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,050
我这么说是因为  尽管有种种问题
I say that because, despite our troubles...

93
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,650
我们仍然团结一体
we are one community.

94
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,330
我们仍是一家人
One family.

95
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,240
这给了我们力量
And that gives us strength.

96
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,910
这股力量无比强大
That strength is a powerful thing.

97
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,890
不容忽视
It's not invisible.

98
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,650
光芒万丈
It radiates.

99
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,290
我相信上帝会给我目标
I place my faith in God to give me purpose.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,640
我希望你们给我力量
I put my hope in you to give me strength.

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
嗯  先生
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,560
而明天你们投票的时候
And come tomorrow, when you vote...

103
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,840
我也希望你们能信任我
I hope that you will place your trust in me...

104
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,420
让我们继续带领这个国家前行
...to help continue to lead this country

105
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,040
就像我们在这里齐心协力  共建家园
as we have led this community, together.

106
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,150
非常感谢你们
Thank you all very much.

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,180
我是莉安·哈维  去华盛顿
I'm LeAnn Harvey, traveling to Washington.

109
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,780
第一夫人还没来  哈维女士
The First Lady isn't here yet, Ms. Harvey,

110
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,390
不过如果你愿意的话可以先登机
but you're welcome to board the plane, if you'd like.

111
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,330
不了  我还是等她来吧  谢谢
Uh, no, I'll wait until she gets here. Thank you.

112

艾丹
Aidan.

113
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,010
我刚把调研报告发过去了
Hey, I just sent the research.

114
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,850
-结果怎么样  -遮天怒火啊
- What's the gist? - The anger, it's biblical.

115
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,330
-油价闹的吗  -是啊  上学烧汽油
- Uh, gas prices? - Yeah, gas is school.

116
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,030
上班烧汽油
Gas is work.

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,350
全家去迪士尼乐园也得烧汽油
Gas is the family trip to Disneyland.

118
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,820
油价每涨一毛钱  愤怒指数就涨6个百分点
Every cent it goes up is another six points on the anger index.

119
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,990
我们预测油价升至7元每加仑  就会全民暴动
We predict that $7 a gallon will get you riots.

120
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,320
第一夫人呢
What about the First Lady?

121
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
她的形象比她丈夫积极多了
Oh, she's faring better than he is.

122
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,330
主要是同情她母亲病重
Sympathy for the sick mother.

123
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,990
多谢你们加急赶出来
Thanks for the rush job on this.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,530
你是朋友嘛  再说这个要比
Well, you're a friend. And this is far more interesting than...

125
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,750
调查五岁小孩的抗抑郁药名  或者
testing names of anti-depressants for five-year-olds, or...

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,250
中产家庭主妇垂涎什么颜色的跑步机有趣多了
what color cross trainers soccer moms will drool over.

127
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,070
-我还以为你讨厌政治  -没错
- I thought you hated politics. - I do.

128
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,140
但是愤怒和诱惑
But anger? And seduction?

129
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,070
这些可好玩得很
Those are interesting.

130
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,220
-母亲  我的耳环  -怎么
- Mother, my earrings. - Yes?

131
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,490
被你拿了
You took them.

132
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,610
我才没拿
I did no such thing.

133
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,530
我说了不是我...
I said I don't...

134
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,670
你要拿我的钱  我也拿点你的东西
You're taking my money. I took something of yours.

135
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,210
克莱尔
Claire...

136
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,620
你今天走了就别回来了
When you leave today, I don't want you coming back.

137
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,440
我想来就来  想走就走  母亲
Oh, I'll come and go as I please, Mother.

138
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,300
太滑稽了
This is unreal.

139
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,970
你确定我们能指望这人
You sure we can count on this guy?

140
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,020
他厌恶弗兰西斯  这一点绝对可以指望
He loathes Francis. That we can count on.

141
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,880
但是你也多留意
But use your best judgment.

142
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,850
这是谁做的调查
Who compiled this?

143
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,730
和我有合作的一家分析公司
An analytics firm I contract with,

144
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,500
国内顶尖
one of the best in the country.

145
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,590
他们可靠吗
They can be trusted?

146
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,500
可靠  我直接和老板接洽的
Yes. I work directly with the owner.

147
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,050
弗兰西斯很需要拿下南卡罗莱纳
Francis really needs this win in South Carolina.

148
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,620
当然了
He sure does.

149
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,760
再向市场投放些战略储备吧
Let's release more of the strategic reserve.

150
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,160
这也许能减缓涨价势头  但遏制不住的
That might slow down the price inflation, but it won't halt it.

151
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,470
两位女士可喜欢这道肋排啊
How are you two ladies enjoying those ribs?

152
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,470
吃完之后我得美美地睡一会儿
Mmm, I'm gonna need a nap after this.

153
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,360
那你们慢用
Well, you'll have time.

154
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,440
我还得打两小时的电话筹款
I have two hours of fundraising calls to make.

155
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
非常感谢您
It was very nice of you

156
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,810
让我们在您家落脚  总统先生
to let us stay at your house, Mr. President.

157
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,280
我们加夫尼人就是这么好客
Well, that's how we do things here in Gaffney.

158
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,200
先生
Sir?

159
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,250
听着  我决不会和他谈救市计划
Listen, I am not gonna negotiate a bailout

160
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,670
除非他在私有化问题上让步
if he won't budge on privatization.

161
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,530
他想饿死自己的人民  随他的便
If he wants to let his own people starve, so be it.

162
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,640
他或许会转向北京求助  那样就会
He may look for relief from Beijing, and that would--

163
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,770
他恨中国胜过恨我们
The only thing he hates more than us is China.

164
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,670
他不会对北京扣头的
He won't kowtow.

165
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,560
但如果佩特罗夫真向北京低头
But if Petrov does cave to them,

166
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,620
那全球能源市场就会...
that puts the global energy--

167
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,590
凯茜  我待会儿再打给你
Look, Cathy, I have to call you back.

168
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,490
-什么时候  -半小时前吧
- When? - About 30 minutes ago.

169
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,300
-这是您的保险柜  433号  -谢谢
- So this will be your box, number 433. - Thank you.

170
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,860
您要不再在我们这里再开个储蓄账户
Would you like to open up a savings account with us?

171
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,780
-借记卡什么的  -不了  保险箱就好
- Debit card? - No, the box is fine.

172
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,570
好吧
Okay.

173
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,910
我能不能自己...
Would you mind if I...

174
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,510
当然可以  我回避一下
Oh, sure. I'll give you some privacy.

175
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,560
谢谢啦
Thank you.

176
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,110
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

177
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,380
我也是  弗兰西斯
You, too, Francis.

178
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,650
真没想到
I'm surprised.

179
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,760
一直没你的消息  然后你突然就来了
I don't hear from you, then you just show up.

180
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,310
说实话  直到飞机落地  我都不确定要不要来
Mmm, to be honest, I wasn't sure until I landed.

181
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,190
你有点晒黑了
You've gotten some sun.

182
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,350
昨天去田间地头拉票来着  该戴顶帽子的
Tractor-pulling event yesterday. I should've worn a hat.

183
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,480
-桃瑞丝和西莉娅也在吗  -来过
- Are Doris and Celia here? - They were.

184
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,800
我在客房里为她们加了两张床
I set up cots for them in the guest room,

185
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,490
但我一听你要来  就让她们住酒店去了
but when I heard you were coming, I sent them off to a hotel.

186
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,710
我想着你可能会想住客房
I figured you'd want that room for yourself.

187
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,740
多谢你费心了
That's very thoughtful.

188
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,720
你马上还有活动吧
You have an event now.

189
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,870
莱姆斯顿学院
Limestone College.

190
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,750
那我和你一起去
Well, I'll join you.

191
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,440
她们也会去  如果你不想见...
They'll be there, if you'd rather not see--

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,490
没事
It'll be fine.

193
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,480
除非你不想让我去
Unless you'd rather I not go.

194
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,230
怎么会  我很乐意你一起去
No, I'd love you to come.

195
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,980
如果他知道跟我有关
If he knows I'm involved...

196
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,450
那就别让他知道
So make sure he doesn't.

197
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,330
我能看看吗
Can I see it?

198
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,980
我的天
Oh, boy.

199
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,330
这下有好戏看了
Now, this could get interesting.

200
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,590
明早之前办好
We need it done by tomorrow morning.

201
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,220
我表亲有个朋友  开了家工业打印店
Well, my cousin has a friend, owns an industrial print shop,

202
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,990
但这么大幅的
but a job that size...

203
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,280
这些应该够了
This should cover it.

204
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,990
绰绰有余
And then some.

205
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,380
想不到希瑟·邓巴也会玩这一套
Oh, I didn't know Heather Dunbar had it in her.

206
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,430
认识你很高兴  蔡斯先生
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Chase.

207
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,580
真不喝点冰茶吗
Well, are you sure you wouldn't like some iced tea?

208
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
谢谢  不喝了  我还有事
Thank you, no. I should get going.

209
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,160
要不留下玩玩吧
How about some fries with that shake?

210
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,460
照我说的把事情办好  别让我再跑一趟了
Get done what I want done. Don't make me come back here.

211
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,470
-曼尼怎么说的  -我代你的班  哥们
- What did Manny say? - I got your shift, bro.

212
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,970
-那车呢  -那辆蒙迪欧
- What about the car? - The Fusion.

213
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,360
我可以重设里程表
I can reset the odometer,

214
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,150
下班之后停到你家门口
park it in front of your place after work.

215
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,560
不过  你明晚之前必须还回来
But, hey... you gotta get it back by tomorrow night.

216
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,040
-不然等他们清点库存...  -我保证
- Otherwise, when they do the inventory-- - I promise you.

217
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,760
好吧
All right.

218
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,290
说说报酬吧
So the cost.

219
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,600
等我工资发下来我就...
As soon as I get my paycheck, I'll--

220
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,190
不  我不想要钱
No. I don't want money.

221
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,260
其他在这儿干活儿的人我都看不上眼
Most of the other guys work here, they ain't much to look at.

222
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,540
但你
You?

223
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,320
我怎么都看不够
Keep lookin' over.

224
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,250
哥们  你别...
Hey, man, listen...

225
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,490
-你还想不想用车  -我自己想办法吧
- You want the car or not? - I'll find some other way.

226
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,610
我知道你的底细
I know about you.

227
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,770
我见过你的假释官来查你的岗
I seen your parole officer come check in on you.

228
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,190
如果他知道你偷了一辆车  会怎么办你
What would he say about you taking one of these cars?

229
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,460
来吧
Come on.

230
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,390
上车
Get in.

231
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,180
我今天刚刚了解到  莱姆斯顿学院
I just learned today that Limestone College,

232
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,740
创立于1845年
founded in 1845,

233
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,740
是南卡罗莱纳第一所招收女生的学校
was the first women's college in South Carolina,

234
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,560
在全国也是最早的几所之一
and one of the first in the nation.

235
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,520
这非常了不起
And that's something to be proud of.

236
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,460
自那时起  这所学校和她的学生成就斐然
And since then, this school and its students have flourished.

237
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,710
这个年轻向上的群体
A young, eager community

238
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,590
超越种族  性别和背景
of men and women of all races and backgrounds,

239
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,970
是美国未来的最佳写照
a true reflection of America's future.

240
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,440
他是怎么说服你回来的
How did he convince you to come back?

241
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,760
我自己说服了自己
I convinced myself.

242
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,350
我丈夫去世时我们结婚已有46年
Forty-six years I was married to my husband before he passed.

243
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,930
但如果他像弗兰克对你那样对我
But if he'd pulled on me what Frank pulled on you,

244
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,330
他会早死很多年
he would've been long gone.

245
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,780
我认为这样对大家都有好处
I think it's worked out for the best.

246
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,720
您女儿将会是一位出色的众议员
Your daughter is going to make a fabulous congresswoman.

247
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,970
谢谢
Well, thank you.

248
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,550
还有两分钟
Two minutes.

249
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,500
弗兰克·安德伍德了解我们对平等的渴求
Now, Frank Underwood understands the need for equality,

250
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,330
无论是教育平等  还是生活中的平等
in education and throughout our lives.

251
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,160
最重要的是  他相信给每个美国人
Most of all, he believes in giving every American

252
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,240
谋生计的机会
the opportunity to earn a living.

253
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,990
他以前就践行了这一信念  他也会坚持下去
He put this belief into action before and he will again,

254
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,360
弗兰克·安德伍德
and Frank Underwood

255
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,050
决不会允许他的奋斗止步于莱姆斯顿
will not allow this journey to end with Limestone.

256
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
你们将步入世界
You will go out into this world

257
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,900
让世人惊艳于你们的才智
and astonish us all with your intellect,

258
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,890
你们的价值  和你们的力量
your... your worthiness, and your strength.

259
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,170
现在请允许我请出我见过的最坚强的女人
Now, I would like to introduce two of the strongest women I know.

260
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,550
你们俩真是  亲密无间啊
Well, don't you look thick as thieves.

261
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,060
以及美国的第一夫人  克莱尔·安德伍德
...and the First Lady of the United States, Claire Underwood.

262
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,980
就好像她从没离开过
It's as though she never left.

263
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,420
我担心的就是这个
And that's what I'm afraid of.

264
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,650
来吧  我们尽快干完
All right, let's hurry on up, now.

265
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,650
布加耶夫告诉我他们愿意
Bugayev is telling me that they are willing

266
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,280
在下月1日之前
to reduce their oil output by

267
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,180
再减产20%的原油
another 20% by the first of next month.

268
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,280
油价走势预测如何
What are the projections on gas prices?

269
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,370
每桶原油超过150美元
North of 150 a barrel for oil.

270
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,990
汽油每加仑6到7块
Six, maybe $7 a gallon for fuel.

271
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,010
我的电话都快被打爆了  先生
My phone has been ringing off the hook, sir,

272
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,070
从英国到波兰都打个不停
from the U.K. to Poland.

273
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,930
国际货币基金组织希望
The IMF wants to help us

274
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,710
帮助我们制定债务免除方案
with the debt relief solution.

275
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,710
先生
Sir?

276
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,390
我们得以暴制暴
We need to respond to strength with strength.

277
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,260
我不知道我们还要怎么"暴"
Well, I don't know how we could be any stronger,

278
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,050
除非入侵俄罗斯
other than to invade Russia.

279
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,960
如果我们那么做了呢
And what if we do?

280
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,440
-什么  先生  -不是动用军队
- Excuse me, sir? - Not with troops.

281
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,130
而是用恐惧
With fear.

282
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,110
他从未信任过我们
He's never trusted us.

283
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,740
他已经觉得我们操纵了米尔金失败的政变
He already thinks we're behind Milkin's failed coup.

284
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,500
如果我们让米尔金有机会取得成功呢
What if we put Milkin in a position to succeed.

285
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,120
我并不在乎米尔金是不是真能成功
Now, I don't care if Milkin actually succeeds.

286
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,240
解冻他一切财产  让他飞去接壤国家
Unfreeze all his assets. Fly him to a border country.

287
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,690
让他跟其他异见者见面
Put him in a room with other dissidents.

288
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,020
得让佩特罗夫知道我们不会罢休
Petrov needs to know that we'll stop at nothing.

289
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,780
先生  这样的行为将造成外交影响...
Sir, the diplomatic repercussions of such an action--

290
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,600
我只想装装样子
All I want is the appearance.

291
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,980
尽快估计一下最好和最坏的结果
Let's look at best and worst case scenarios as soon as possible.

292
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,160
多谢了
Thank you very much.

293
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,790
抱歉  我以为
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were--

294
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,900
那床太硬了
That bed was too stiff.

295
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,380
-那我过去睡吧  -就睡这儿吧
- I'll sleep in there then. - Sleep in here.

296
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,060
我们以前在地板上铺床垫
We had the mattress on the floor.

297
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,480
什么
What?

298
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,000
头一年  床垫还有邦邦硬的枕头
That first year, the mattress and those lumpy pillows.

299
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,010
你大半夜还老偷我的
Which you used to steal from me in the middle of the night.

300
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,140
还不是因为你把被子都拽走了
Well, because you would hog all the covers.

301
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,170
天呐  我们当时过得真够差的
God, we were living like heathens.

302
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,820
那是因为我们把一切都投入了竞选
Well, because we were spending everything we had on the race.

303
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,670
但我记得我以前把这里想作宫殿
I remember I used to think this place was a palace, though.

304
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,430
-这里是座宫殿  -跟农场没法比
- It was. - Not compared to the ranch.

305
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,970
是座宫殿  是因为它属于我们
Well, it was a palace because it was ours.

306
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,850
晚安  弗兰西斯
Good night, Francis.

307
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,780
媒体都包围了房子
The press has surrounded the house.

308
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,190
我根本出不去
I can't leave the damn place

309
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,030
得先想好我究竟该说什么
until I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

310
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,260
我们得取消您的活动
We need to cancel your events.

311
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,800
当然得取消了
Of course we need to cancel my events.

312
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,950
-我脸上的表情...  -怎么回事
- The expression on my face is a-- - What's going on?

313
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,420
...拍摄地点未知
...taken in a nondescript location,

314
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,900
似乎并非是直接对三K党的支持
does not seem to be a direct endorsement for the KKK.

315
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,580
-天呐  -我父亲
- My God. - My father.

316
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,370
先生  琼斯议员女士要回德州了
Sir? Congresswoman Jones is heading back to Texas.

317
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,290
马上给我接通她的电话
Get her on the phone for me, right now.

318
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,660
密查姆  你得去帮我个忙
Meechum, I need you to do me a favor.

319
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,160
现在尚不清楚
There are no clues at the moment

320
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,300
此事是谁所为
as to who may be responsible,

321
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,270
加夫尼警察正在取下照片
but Gaffney PD is taking the canvas picture down

322
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,820
一小时内就能完成  以备进一步调查
within the hour for further examination.

323
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,750
就在初选这天
On primary day.

324
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,540
我现在无法证实任何事  那是谁
I can't verify anything yet in terms of who it is,

325
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,720
或者照片是否是真
or even whether it's real, or--

326
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,260
新罕布什尔前一天  是婚姻问题的报道
The day before New Hampshire, there's a marriage story,

327
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,120
现在在南卡罗来纳又闹这事
and now in South Carolina we have this?

328
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,050
我们为什么会遭偷袭
Uh, how are we getting blindsided?

329
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,850
-我该接一下  -让它响去吧
- I should get that-- - Let it ring.

330
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,650
听着
Look...

331
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,970
吵架的事还是你告诉我我才知道
I didn't even know about the fight until you told me.

332
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,250
你怎么能指望我知道照片的事
And how was I supposed to know about this photo?

333
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,760
因为预防这种烂事就是你的职责
Because it is your job to get out ahead of this shit.

334
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,520
这事该是对手研究团队去挖  竞选就是如此
The oppo team should've tracked this down. That's the campaign.

335
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,730
如果沃恩不知道  或是如果总统没告诉他
So, if Vaughn didn't know, or the president didn't tell him...

336
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,390
肯定是他身边的人  能掌握很多情况的人
It has to be somebody close to him. Someone with a lot of access.

337
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,490
总统打来了
The president's on the line.

338
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,220
先生  是道格  赛斯也在
Sir, it's Doug. I'm in here with Seth.

339
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,020
我要说实话  我要说那是我父亲
I'm gonna tell the truth. I'm gonna say it is my father.

340
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,360
如果能说得好
That's probably the best response,

341
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,830
这样回应或许最好
if you have a good way to frame it.

342
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,260
我知道该说什么  问题是在哪说
I know what to say. The question is where.

343
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,240
一对一  独家采访
One-on-one. Something exclusive.

344
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,120
不能跟媒体说
Not in front of the media.

345
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,690
我得直接对选民说
I need to connect directly to the voters,

346
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,000
非裔选民
the African American voters.

347
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,740
总统先生  国务卿打来了
Mr. President, I've got the Secretary of State.

348
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,850
我回头再打过去
I'll call her back.

349
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,800
稍等  密查姆
Hang on, boys. Meechum?

350
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,290
还在这儿  先生
It's here, sir.

351
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
你都了解到了什么
What can you tell me?

352
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,830
昨天  一个叫莱斯利·麦金泰尔的女人
Yesterday, a woman named Leslie McIntyre

353
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,860
开了个新保险箱
opened a new box.

354
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,850
我正在查这个名字
I'm having the name run now,

355
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,660
但她似乎用了假社保号
but it looks like she used a fake social.

356
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,200
监控录像呢
What about security footage?

357
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,810
他们每天早上重置摄像头
They reset the cameras every morning.

358
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,840
我问了她长什么样
I asked what she looked like

359
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,520
经理只说是个白人黑发女人
and all the manager said is that it was a Caucasian brunette.

360
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,700
没什么异常之处
Nothing strange about her.

361
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,520
好吧  把盒子拿回来
All right. Bring the box back here.

362
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,140
一刻别让它离开你的视线范围
Don't let it out of your sight.

363
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,610
就我所知  只有一张照片
As far as I know, there's only one photograph.

364
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,440
密查姆说照片还在银行
Meechum says it's still at the bank.

365
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,590
先生  是我一个人了
Sir, it's just me.

366
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,330
你跟我想到一起了吗
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

367
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,800
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

368
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,010
你盯住他
Well, you keep an eye on him.

369
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,860
我要白宫所有人的邮件和电话记录
I want emails and phone records of everyone in the White House.

370
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,450
包括你的
Including yours.

371
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,360
我的  你真觉得...
Mine? You honestly think--

372
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,530
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

373
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,400
没有
No.

374
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,300
很好
Good.

375
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,130
真是不幸
It's unfortunate.

376
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,500
邓巴女士  邓巴女士
Ms. Dunbar! Ms. Dunbar? Ms. Dunbar?

377
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,520
这样的画面
The imagery...

378
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,810
居然有人靠如此卑劣的手段
That anyone would try to inflame racial discord

379
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,810
企图煽动种族不和
by doing something so base.

380
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,350
那是不是凯文·安德伍德根本不重要
Whether it's Calvin Underwood isn't the point.

381
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,160
即便是  这一点我们无法确认
If it is, and we have no confirmation on that,

382
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,030
那么是谁挂上去的  为什么要这么做
I mean... Who put this up? And why?

383
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,390
谁知道呢
Who knows.

384
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,590
而且父亲的罪未必是孩子的罪
And the sins of the father aren't necessarily the sins of the son.

385
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,950
但  这令人不安  十分不安
But... it's troubling. Very troubling.

386
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,130
这样的伎俩很可能揭开旧疮疤
Stunts like these have the potential to open old wounds.

387
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,430
我们不能允许那样的事发生  我们得不受其影响
We can't let that happen. We need to rise above it.

388
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,240
要明白  不管你支持谁
Make clear, no matter who you support,

389
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,970
这样的行为是不可容忍的
that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated.

390
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,950
给我接克拉克牧师和吉恩·克兰希
Get me Reverend Clark and Gene Clancy on the phone.

391
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,150
他们要你去大巴那边
Hey, they want you out by the bus.

392
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,480
大巴那边
By the bus?

393
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,330
-你是谁  -抱歉
- Um, who are you? - Sorry.

394
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,970
巴特勒县办公室的马克
Mark from the Butler County office.

395
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,330
他们要辛辛那提的志愿者
They want all the Cincinnati volunteers

396
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,240
都去大巴那边集合跟邓巴合影
to gather by the bus for a photo with Dunbar.

397
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,700
珍告诉我我不能离开岗位的
Jenn told me I wasn't supposed to leave--

398
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,930
所以她叫我过来喊你
That's why she sent me.

399
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,660
她不希望你错过合影  去吧
She didn't want you to miss the photo. Go.

400
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,000
大巴那边吗
Out by the bus?

401
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,570
她叫我替你
She told me to cover for you.

402
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,950
好
Okay, um...

403
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,900
有几个人没来
well, there were a couple of no-shows,

404
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,410
其他人都来了
but, you know, otherwise, everyone's here.

405
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,720
-好  谢谢  -太棒了  谢谢
- Okay. Thanks. - Very convenient. Thanks.

406
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,640
快去吧
Enjoy.

407
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,160
我是《克利夫兰老实人报》的戴维·格里姆斯
I'm David Grimes with the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

408
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,150
你的证件呢
Where's your credential?

409
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,790
我蠢得把证件忘在车里了
I was an idiot and left it in the car.

410
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,880
不过前台签到处的人认识我
They recognized me at the check-in desk, though.

411
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,660
我可以带你去等候处
I can direct you to the bullpen,

412
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,070
但是这一区不对媒体开放
but this area is off-limits to the press.

413
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,270
我其实是来采访辛西娅·德里斯科尔的
I'm actually supposed to do an interview with Cynthia Driscoll.

414
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,360
先遣人员叫我来这边
The Advance guys said I should come this way.

415
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,030
在这里等一下
Wait here.

416
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,110
抱歉  总统先生  我们做不到
I'm sorry, Mr. President, we just can't do it.

417
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,910
这里45%的选票在非裔手中
Forty-five percent of the vote here is African American.

418
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,210
你和你母亲对我的支持
You and your mother standing by my side

419
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,380
会有很重要的作用...
would go a long way to put this--

420
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,960
我在一个非裔及拉丁裔的选区竞选议员
I am running for Congress in a black and Latino district.

421
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,800
我母亲曾在游行时被暴打  被水冲
My mother was beaten and hosed down in marches.

422
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,220
你想让我们替一个三K党人的儿子作担保吗
You want us to vouch for a man whose father was in the KKK?

423
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,360
-不  他不是三K党  -照片上那个就是他
- No, he was not in the Klan. - That was him in that picture.

424
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,780
对  可这个我已经解释过了
Yes, but I've explained that.

425
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,840
内战就是在本州掀起的
This is the state where the Civil War started,

426
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,100
有些人汽车保险杠上还贴着南军旗贴纸
where you can still see rebel flags on bumper stickers.

427
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,000
这里曾有很严重的种族暴行  总统先生
There is a history of racist brutality here, Mr. President.

428
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,790
那种符号影响很大
Those sort of symbols matter.

429
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,240
能让你母亲接电话吗
Could you put your mother on, please?

430
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,400
妈妈
Mom?

431
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,890
他想跟你说话
He wants to speak to you.

432
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,750
总统先生
Mr. President.

433
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,470
听着  我们需要团结  我为西莉娅背书了
Listen, we need to stand together. Now, I've endorsed Celia.

434
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,910
克莱尔在德州能给她帮很大忙
Claire can do a great deal for her in Texas.

435
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,280
现在远离安德伍德一家对她更好
She's better off without the Underwoods at this point.

436
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,720
那你的诊所呢
But what about your clinic?

437
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,070
你要是拿我们的诊所要挟我  别人会怎么看
Imagine how that would look, holding our clinic for ransom.

438
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,220
我是想博取您的好意  议员女士
I'm appealing to your goodwill, Congresswoman.

439
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,080
等我们不再遭受殴打和枪击
When we stop getting beaten and shot...

440
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,530
我会好意待您的  总统先生
you'll have my goodwill, Mr. President.

441
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,390
再见
Goodbye.

442
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,210
再接吉恩·克兰希
Get me Gene Clancy again.

443
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,140
会不会是奥林·蔡斯  弗兰西斯
What if it's Oren Chase, Francis?

444
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,400
他也可能拿到一份副本
He could've gotten his hands on a copy.

445
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,780
照片可能不止一张
There may be more than one.

446
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,070
先打给密查姆  然后克兰希
Meechum first, then Clancy.

447
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,190
卢卡斯
Lucas?

448
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,910
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

449
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,440
-我还以为你...  -是的  不过已经出来了
- I thought you were--  - I was. I'm... I'm out now.

450
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,100
这很重要
This is important.

451
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,140
总统先生  您父亲是种族主义者吗
Mr. President, was your father a racist?

452
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,410
您父亲是种族主义者吗
Was your father a racist?

453
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,930
安德伍德夫人  你母亲还好吗
Mrs. Underwood, is your mother okay?

454
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,770
总统先生
Mr. President!

455
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,690
-蔡斯先生  -你是谁
- Mr. Chase? - Who are you?

456
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,600
特勤局的
United States Secret Service.

457
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,160
我们要的不是你  蔡斯先生
We're not after you, Mr. Chase.

458
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,870
我们是想要指使你这么干的人
We're after whoever put you up to it.

459
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,960
指使我做什么
Put me up to what?

460
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,380
你可以现在回答我
You can answer me here,

461
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,980
或者我们可以去问哥伦比亚办事处
or we can go to the Columbia field office for questioning.

462
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,460
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

463
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,060
请您跟我来一下  先生
All right, I need you to come with me, sir.

464
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,290
-等等  -请出来  先生
- Now, hold on. - Step outside, sir.

465
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,780
我要找律师
I wanna talk to a lawyer.

466
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,730
4126号需要支援
I need backup at 4126.

467
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,440
-没必要这样吧  -除非你合作  先生
- Come on, that's not necessary. - Not if you cooperate, sir.

468
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,810
我告诉你不会惹麻烦吧
If I talk to you, I won't get in trouble?

469
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,690
我向上帝起誓  邓巴女士  这都是真的
I swear to God, Ms. Dunbar. It's all true.

470
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,810
证据呢
Then where's the proof?

471
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,520
我没办法找证据  但你可以
I don't have the means, but you do.

472
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,810
你调查过他  你知道他很危险
You've investigated him before. You know he's dangerous.

473
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,610
古德温先生
Mr. Goodwin--

474
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,850
如果我不是查到了真相  他为什么要针对我
Why would he go after me if I wasn't onto something?

475
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,120
这是一起高级钓鱼执法
This was a high-level sting operation.

476
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,170
为此调动了大量资源
Major resources were dedicated to it.

477
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,660
我原本是个记者  没有犯罪记录
I'm... I was a journalist, no criminal record.

478
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,440
怎么突然就成了威胁  除非我...
How am I suddenly such a threat, unless I'm--

479
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,810
就算我相信你
Even if I did believe you,

480
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,520
我已经不是司法部的了  现在只是个普通市民
I am no longer part of the DOJ. I am a private citizen now.

481
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,860
正在竞选总统
Who's running for president--

482
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,260
你来这儿不违反证人保护计划的规定吗
Aren't you breaking WITSEC protocol by being here?

483
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,900
我不想再跟他谈了
I am no longer comfortable with this.

484
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,930
你是我最后的机会  求你了
You're... you're my last chance. Please!

485
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,460
-我建议你还是回家吧  -我  可是我
- I suggest that you go back home. - I'm... The things I've--

486
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,690
-别逼我们叫保安  -求你了  就
- Don't make us get security involved.  - Please. Just--

487
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,180
你得在这儿等五分钟  让她先离开
Just give us five minutes until she's out of the building.

488
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,910
求你了  求你听我说
Please. Please listen to me.

489
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,690
我求你了
I'm... I'm begging you.

490
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,410
帮帮我
Just help me...

491
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,080
帮帮我
Help.

492
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,340
求你了  求你了
Please, please...

493
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,760
天呐
Oh, God...

494
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,210
你怎么能让我跟他见面
How could you put me in a room with him?

495
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,090
我并不知道他想要说什么
I didn't know what he was gonna say.

496
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,840
不过我以为他这么煞费苦心
But I assumed that if he went to such great lengths--

497
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,100
他只有酒驾的证据  那什么都不算上
The DUI, that's all he has proof of. That's nothing.

498
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,210
我都帮过别人逃脱酒驾的惩罚
Even I have helped people get off for that.

499
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,650
-还有外遇  -没证据
- There's the affair... - With no evidence.

500
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,350
他又扯什么谋杀  还杀了两个
Then he leaps to murder... Two murders?

501
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,830
这人有病
The man is troubled.

502
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,630
他那眼神我们都看见了
We saw the look in his eye.

503
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,670
我以为他有什么真凭实据呢
I thought he might have something real.

504
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,110
他以前做编辑做得挺好的
He used to be a good editor.

505
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,130
可他现在是个定了罪的重犯
And now he is a convicted felon.

506
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,190
你说要想尽一切办法的
You said no stone unturned.

507
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,410
对不起  我应该想得更周到一些的
I'm sorry, I should have thought better of it.

508
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,750
是啊  你是应该
Yes, you should have.

509
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,030
就这样吧  我们在南卡罗来纳情况如何
Let's let it go. How are we doing in South Carolina?

510
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,540
早期出口民调结果不错
Early exit polls are good.

511
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,650
-我们有机会赢  -真能赢吗
- We have a shot at winning. - Actually winning?

512
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,920
那个广告牌造成了不小的破坏
That billboard's done real damage.

513
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,230
你能这么做我很感激  吉恩
I appreciate you doing this, Gene.

514
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,020
你真是救了我一命
You're really saving my life here.

515
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,340
等我竞选县长的时候你记着就行
Just remember it when I run for county executive.

516
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,250
你随时需要我随时过来
I'll be down here whenever you need me.

517
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,640
重点不在时间  而是给什么和给多少
Oh, it's not the when, it's the what. And how much.

518
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,470
下午好  奥林
Afternoon, Oren.

519
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,990
-总统先生  -坐吧
- Mr. President. - Have a seat.

520
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,460
上次大桃子的事你还没长记性啊
Didn't you learn your lesson with all that Peachoid nonsense?

521
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,250
你说了要帮我搞定第4选区的
Well, you promised to help me with the 4th.

522
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,580
我被怨恨蒙蔽了
I let my bitterness get the better of me.

523
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,310
谁找的你  一个女的吗
Who specifically approached you? A woman?

524
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,720
-黑头发  -对
- Brunette?  - Yeah.

525
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,910
大概这么高  挺好看的
Uh, about so tall, good-looking.

526
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,070
也不告诉我名字
Wouldn't give me her name.

527
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,280
我们应该把所有的
We should get photos

528
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,950
邓巴团队里符合描述的人的照片找来
of everyone in Dunbar's staff that fits that description.

529
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,400
已经在整理了  夫人
Already compiling it, ma'am.

530
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,560
至于你嘛
And as for you...

531
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,570
你要去上电视  越多越好
you're gonna plant yourself in front of as many TV cameras

532
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,870
愿意拍你的都去上
that can gather around that bony ass of yours.

533
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,680
你要表现出万分愧疚  然后良心发现
You're gonna be wracked with guilt and overcome with conscience.

534
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,600
你做好了  我就确保你不会被起诉
And you do that and I'll make sure that you aren't charged.

535
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,520
你想让我说是邓巴指使的吗
You want me to say it was Dunbar?

536
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,680
拜托  聪明点  奥林  她会告你诽谤的
Come on, be smarter than that, Oren. She'll sue you for slander.

537
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,800
说你被收买了就行
Just say you were bought

538
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,160
剩下的大家自己就能琢磨出来
and people will connect the dots on their own.

539
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,450
把他带走吧
Get him out of here.

540
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,180
我希望你不会像
I hope you don't Welsh on

541
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,250
对待奥林那样违背对我的诺言
your promise to me the way you did with Oren.

542
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,620
你是家人  吉恩  我决不会背叛家人
You're family, Gene. I would never betray one of the family.

543
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,800
走吧
Shall we?

544
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,230
准备好了吗
Ready?

545
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,220
你们很多人曾选我当市长
Many of you voted for me for mayor

546
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,630
是因为你们认识我一辈子了
because you've known me your whole lives.

547
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,610
而我认识弗兰克·安德伍德一辈子了
Well, I've known Frank Underwood my whole life.

548
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,550
他是我的朋友  我信任他
He's my friend and I trust him,

549
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,900
我不在乎那个广告牌上挂了什么
and I don't care what's on that billboard.

550
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,120
我为他是我的总统感到自豪
I'm proud he's my president,

551
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,140
我也为今天能同他站在一起而自豪
and I'm proud to have... be standing with him here today.

552
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,820
谢谢  吉恩
Thank you, Gene.

553
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,500
昨天  我站在这个教堂里
Yesterday, I stood in this church...

554
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,110
我提到了我们这个群体
and I talked about community.

555
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,260
我提到了我们集体的力量
I talked about our collective strength,

556
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,320
无论是黑人还是白人  在危机时刻走到一起
black and white, coming together during times of crisis.

557
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,420
今天肯定有很多人觉得我是个伪君子
And today there's probably a lot of you who think I'm a hypocrite.

558
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,860
一个父亲是三K党的人  怎么可能站在这里
How can a man whose father was in the KKK stand up here

559
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,070
真心实意地说出那些话呢
and mean the things he said?

560
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,610
没错  照片上的人是我父亲
Yes, that is my father in that photograph,

561
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,240
我不会否认
I'm not going to deny it.

562
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,330
但事实是  他不是三K党的人
But the truth is he wasn't in the Klan.

563
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,500
拍照片的那年
The year that photo was taken,

564
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,330
我父亲需要五千美元偿还债务
my father needed $5,000 to pay off our debts,

565
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,740
不然银行就要没收我们的农场
or the bank was gonna foreclose on our farm.

566
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,080
父亲跑遍了这附近
Now, my father went to every other bank

567
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,690
方圆百里内的所有银行
within a hundred miles of here,

568
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,510
没一个愿意贷款给他
and no one would give him a loan.

569
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,680
他向朋友  向亲戚借
He asked friends, he asked family,

570
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,520
但没人有那么多钱
but nobody had that kind of money.

571
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,790
我们马上就要倾家荡产了
And we were about to lose everything.

572
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,590
当时  加夫尼第一银行的行长
Now, at the time, the owner of the Gaffney First Bank

573
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,160
是三K党的成员
was a member of the Klan.

574
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,420
这在座的一些人知道
Some of you know that.

575
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,780
他完全听从三K党的指挥
And he would do whatever the Klan told him to do,

576
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,330
我父亲也清楚这一点
and my father knew that.

577
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,860
所以父亲就做了他不得不做的
So my father did what he had to do.

578
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,780
他参加了一次集会并乞求那个分会的头头
He went to a meeting and begged the leader of that chapter

579
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,600
在银行行长面前说句话
to talk to the owner of the bank.

580
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,750
照片就是拍摄于那次集会
And at that meeting, that's when that photograph was taken.

581
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,790
他出现在那里仅仅是为了挽救我们的农场
The only reason he was there was to try to save our farm.

582
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,160
凯文·安德伍德痛恨自己参加了那次会议
Now, Calvin Underwood hated himself for going to that meeting.

583
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,050
也痛恨自己拍下了那张照片
He hated himself for taking that photograph.

584
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,220
但会让他更痛恨自己的  是不能保住我们的农场
But he would've hated himself even more if he'd lost our farm...

585
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,930
是不能养活自己的家人
if he hadn't been able to provide and support his family.

586
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,740
我不会试着让你们原谅他
Now, look, I'm not trying to ask you to forgive him

587
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,160
出现在那张照片中
being in that photograph.

588
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,190
他大概以为永远不会有人看到这照片
He probably thought no one would ever see it.

589
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,940
但我恳请大家同情他的困境
But I am asking you to empathize with his predicament.

590
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,400
并扪心自问...
And ask yourselves...

591
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,600
你们会为挽救自己的家庭做些什么
what would you do to save your family?

592
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,460
那盗取了照片  破坏了广告牌的人
Now, whoever stole that photograph and vandalized that billboard,

593
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,380
他们的目的不是要揭露关于我过去的重大丑闻
they're not trying to unearth some big scandal about my past,

594
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,790
因为真相并非如此
'cause it just isn't true.

595
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,460
他们的目的是让我们分裂
What they're trying to do is divide us.

596
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,520
他们真正要达到的目的
What they really wanna succeed in doing

597
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,990
是确保大家今天不把票投给我
is making sure you don't vote for me today.

598
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,530
他们为玷污我的形象
They've gone to a whole lot of trouble

599
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,030
真是煞费苦心
to make me look pretty bad.

600
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,170
但这就是政治
But that's politics.

601
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,660
我今天来到这里
My hope in coming here today...

602
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,690
开诚布公地对这件事发表声明  是希望
and speaking openly and honestly about this...

603
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,970
我们能够保持团结
is that we can stay united.

604
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,220
因此我打算一直待在这里
So my plan is to stay here as long as it takes,

605
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,350
跟每一个人单独交谈
to speak to each one of you individually,

606
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,170
解答你们所有的疑问
and answer every question that you might have.

607
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,260
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

608
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,380
非常感谢  女士
Thank you very much, ma'am.

609
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,540
安德伍德总统
President Underwood,

610
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,850
在他家乡南卡罗来纳州加夫尼发表现场讲话
speaking live in his home town of Gaffney, South Carolina,

611
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,910
回应称其父
addressing claims that

612
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,710
是三K党成员的言论
his father was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

613
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,670
昨晚当地一块公告牌遭到破坏
A billboard there was vandalized late last night

614
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,650
被挂上了一张总统父亲站在一名
with a photo of his father standing

615
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,570
身着三K党长袍的男子旁边的照片
next to a man in Klan robes

616
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,650
并配文  "安德伍德2016"
with the caption, "Underwood 2016."

617
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,000
正如我们刚刚所看到的  总统没有否认
As we've just seen, the president did not deny allegations

618
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,960
其父亲与该组织有联系的指控
that his father had some connection to the organization,

619
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,610
反而解释说凯文·安德伍德只参加了一次集会
instead explaining that Calvin Underwood attended one meeting

620
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,840
是为避免家族桃园遭没收  不得已而为之
as a last resort to save his family's peach farm from foreclosure.

621
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,030
今早其家人被指与三K党
The president was subject to widespread criticism

622
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,960
有关联的消息一经传出  总统便饱受批评
after news of his family's alleged Klan connection broke this morning.

623
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,050
今天的初选结果将会...
Today's primary result will show--

624
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,700
我不知道她的名字  我问过  但她没说
I don't know her name. I asked, but she wouldn't tell me.

625
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,770
我深感懊悔
And I deeply regret

626
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,680
我让我的政治倾向影响了判断力
that I allowed my political leanings to compromise my better judgment.

627
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,470
我想对可能侵犯到的人道歉
I want to apologize to anyone I might have offended

628
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,270
抱歉翻出了如此痛苦的画面
by hoisting up such painful imagery.

629
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,650
有人打电话问是不是我们做的
We're getting calls asking if it was us.

630
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,040
-你觉得是我们团队的人吗  -绝对不会
- Do you think someone from our team-- - Absolutely not.

631
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,250
我觉得是安德伍德叫他这么说的
I think Underwood put this guy up to it.

632
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,110
他想反过来坑我们
He's trying to turn this back around on us.

633
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,320
我们必须坚决否认
We need to deny, forcefully.

634
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,250
我已经在下一场活动安排了媒体采访
I'm already putting a press avail together at your next event.

635
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,630
可能我们得再考虑一下古德温了
Maybe we need to reconsider Goodwin.

636
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,170
-你怎么想的  -我也不确定
- What do you have in mind? - I'm not sure.

637
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,610
看这个
Look at this.

638
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,620
是从白宫泄露的
It came from the goddamn White House!

639
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,590
我们在讯问摄影师了  先生
We're questioning the photographer now, sir.

640
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,900
我准备好了声明
I've got a statement prepared that

641
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,320
这只是个普通活动
this was a run-of-the-mill event,

642
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,830
您和许多参与内战重演的演员合过影
that you took photos with lots of re-enactors.

643
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,620
你怎么解释都没用
It doesn't matter how you spin it.

644
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,680
我刚刚在教堂
I just stood in front of

645
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,730
对一群非裔发表讲话
a group of African Americans in a church

646
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,200
请他们相信我
asking them to believe in me.

647
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,560
他们看到我父亲和三K党人并立已够糟了
It's bad enough they see my father next to a Klansman.

648
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,360
现在又看到我和奴隶制的象征站在一起
Now they see me next to a symbol of slavery.

649
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,050
我要查出是谁泄露的
I wanna find out who's leaking this shit,

650
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,920
把他的头钉在木桩上
and I want their head on a goddamn stake!

651
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,860
先生  我有个想法
Sir, I have a theory.

652
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,040
我觉得...
I think...

653
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,110
我觉得可能是艾德华·密查姆
Well, I think it might be Edward Meechum.

654
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,910
密查姆
Meechum?

655
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,560
他知道您和第一夫人发生了争吵
He knew about the argument between you and the First Lady.

656
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,220
弗吉尼亚那次他也跟去了
He was there on that trip to Virginia.

657
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,300
他绝不会做出这种事来
He would never do something like this.

658
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,970
邓巴有很多钱
Dunbar has a lot of money.

659
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,270
向各大电视台发布声明
Put out a statement to the networks

660
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,340
我不会发表落选讲话了
that I won't be giving a concession speech.

661
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,780
先生  您不觉得这样看起来像在逃避
Sir... don't you think that might look like you're running from--

662
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,240
我刚刚输了我的家乡
I just lost my home state.

663
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,320
我不想再折腾我自己了
I'm not gonna rake myself over the coals.

664
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,370
密查姆
Meechum?

665
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,890
我不能排除任何人
I'm not ruling anyone out.

666
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,900
先生
Sir?

667
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,100
我把银行保险箱拿来了
I brought the safety deposit box for you.

668
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,450
放下吧
You can put it down.

669
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,840
-密查姆  -是  先生
- Meechum. - Yes, sir?

670
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,360
我有没有给过你任何伤害我的理由
Have I given you any reason to hurt me?

671
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,270
伤害您  先生
Hurt you, sir?

672
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,950
我有没有过对不起你的时候
Have I done you wrong in any way?

673
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,750
抱歉  先生  我不明白
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

674
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,460
看着我的眼睛  密查姆
Look me in the eyes, Meechum.

675
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,520
-先生  -密查姆
- Sir... - Meechum, shh.

676
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,950
您还好吗  先生
Are you all right, sir?

677
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,830
不怎么样
I've been better.

678
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,460
我还在执勤
I'm still on duty.

679
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,040
有什么...
Is there...

680
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,130
我能做的吗
anything I can do?

681
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,610
你可以出去帮我多投些票
You could go out and stuff some ballot boxes for me.

682
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,310
-您能缓过来的  -真能就好了
- You'll bounce back from this. - I sure hope I can.

683
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,800
我之前被国会警察...
Uh, when I got fired...

684
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,120
开除以后
from the Capitol Police...

685
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,710
我知道这不能相提并论  但是...
I mean, I know it doesn't compare, but...

686
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,050
我特别难过
I felt pretty bad.

687
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,780
我以为我的职业生涯终结了
I thought my career was over.

688
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,220
然后您扭转了一切
Then you turned everything around.

689
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,930
在选举中  没有第二次机会
You don't get second chances in elections.

690
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,920
我知道
I know.

691
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,290
但还有很多场初选
But there's a lot of primaries ahead.

692
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:46,730
还没有结束  您能过这一关的
All I'm saying is it's not over. You'll get through this.

693
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,940
-抱歉  听起来一定很蠢  -没有
- I'm sorry, that must sound so stupid. - No, it doesn't.

694
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,530
我很感激
I appreciate it.

695
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,160
我去外面车队那里了  先生  有事叫我
I'll be out by the motorcade, sir, if you need anything.

696
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,720
谢谢  密查姆
Thank you, Meechum.

697
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,730
我就知道  但是不愿相信
I knew it, but I didn't wanna believe it.

698
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,700
只是个伤口罢了
It's only a wound.

699
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,960
并不致命
It's not fatal.

700
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,060
我的家乡  克莱尔
My home state, Claire.

701
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,730
坐
Have a seat.

702
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,700
我终结了你的竞选  所以你以牙还牙
I end your race so you end mine?

703
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,130
-听我解释  弗兰西斯  -赌气  报复
- Let me explain, Francis. - Spite, revenge!

704
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,040
坐下吧  我们得谈谈
Please, sit down. We need to talk.

705
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,950
现在生气也没用
Nothing is going to come from anger right now.

706
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,700
昨晚聊天的时候  你说这座房子是宫殿
Last night when we were talking, you called this house a palace.

707
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,490
这是我们开始的地方
This is where we began.

708
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,230
你还记得我母亲差点离开了爸爸
And do you remember when my mother almost left Daddy

709
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,530
就因为他资助了你的竞选吗
because he funded your campaign?

710
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,790
她就是那么讨厌你
That's how much she hated you.

711
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,770
但我当时不在意
But I didn't care,

712
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,580
因为我看到了你的潜质  我看到了未来
because I saw something. I saw a future.

713
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,930
我们的未来
Our future.

714
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,800
你开始摧毁一切之前  我们原本还有未来
We had a future until you started destroying it.

715
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,050
要不你不会听的
Well, you wouldn't have listened otherwise.

716
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,010
我一直都听你的
I always listen to you.

717
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,940
只在我说了你想听的的时候
Only when it's what you want to hear.

718
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,640
好吧  克莱尔  我现在在听
Well, all right, Claire. I'm listening now.

719
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,830
你有什么话这么想说
What is it you so desperately needed to say?

720
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,620
三十年来我们从没输过竞选
We've never lost a race in 30 years.

721
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,530
我们从这里开始  所向披靡
We started here and we've always won.

722
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,920
你我一起
You and I, together.

723
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,830
但你要输了  弗兰西斯
But you are losing, Francis.

724
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,610
人们承受不起高价油
People are getting killed at the gas pumps.

725
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,800
《美国就业法案》不及预期
America Works is falling flat.

726
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,920
你的竞选经理看不清现在的形势
Your campaign manager is ten years behind ten years ago.

727
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,570
你没有值得考虑的竞选搭档
You don't have a viable running mate.

728
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,000
我们都清楚不能是唐纳德·布莱斯
We both know it can't be Donald Blythe.

729
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,580
当然不能
Well, of course not.

730
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,620
但我连名都提不上
But I have to win the goddamn nomination

731
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,460
还考虑什么输赢
before I can start worrying about winning.

732
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,090
就算我没这么做
Even if I hadn't done what I did,

733
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,320
你的竞选也问题重重
your race is in real trouble.

734
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,710
你需要我  弗兰西斯
You need me, Francis.

735
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,160
我的支持率比你高
My approvals are higher than yours.

736
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,860
我能帮你赢下德州
I can help you win Texas.

737
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,050
没错  所以我不希望你在达拉斯竞选
Exactly. Which is why I didn't want you running in Dallas.

738
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,110
我需要你在我身旁
I need you at my side.

739
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,270
没错  但是以另一种方式
Yes, but in a different way.

740
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,770
什么方式
Different how?

741
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,370
我们能相互扶持  让彼此更强  对吧
We make each other stronger, can we agree to that?

742
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,980
那得步调协调  但现在不是这样
When it's working, but it's not working.

743
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,500
我们能协调好
We can make it work.

744
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,100
我们能实现当初结婚时我看到的未来
We can accomplish that future I saw when we first got married.

745
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,220
我们作为搭档  真正的搭档
It was us, as partners, real partners.

746
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,940
我们再一起竞选吧
Let's run together, again.

747
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,670
不只作为夫妻
Not just as husband and wife.

748
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,520
你不是指...
You don't mean...

749
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,060
没错
Yes.

750
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,250
我很担心你  克莱尔
I'm worried about you, Claire.

751
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:35,130
你在说疯话  你被自负蒙蔽了
You're not making any sense. You've let your ego get in the way--

752
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,090
我一直都是你的竞选搭档
I've always been your running mate.

753
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,830
-你只是不愿承认  -当我的副总统吗
- You just didn't wanna see it. - As my vice president?

754
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,380
-天啊  你知道这...  -我反复考虑过了
- Jesus. Do you have any idea--  - I've put a lot of thought into this.

755
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,860
你肯定没想清楚
You can't have thought it through.

756
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,450
-如果你真想透彻了  -她没经验
- Because if you did, you'd come up - She has no experience.

757
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,810
-就能想到千万个理由  -她从没竞选过
- with a million reasons-- - She's never run for anything.

758
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,850
无子  任人唯亲  傲慢  我都考虑过了
No children, nepotism, arrogance, I've run through them all.

759
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,380
没我你赢不了
You can't win without me.

760
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:00,990
我宁愿选懦弱的唐纳德·布莱斯当我的副总统
I would rather have a spineless Donald Blythe as my vice president

761
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:04,010
也强过一个没当选过公职的女人
than a woman who's never held elected office.

762
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,070
你要输给一个没当选过公职的女人了
You're losing to a woman who's never held elected office.

763
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,680
你不配
You don't deserve it.

764
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,280
你没尝过一无所有的滋味
You have no idea what it means to have nothing.

765
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,760
你不重视我们的成就
You don't value what we have achieved.

766
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,760
我这辈子事事都要靠自己努力争取
I have had to fight for everything my entire life.

767
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,380
你知道我为什么留着这张照片吗
Do you know why I kept this?

768
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,090
你知道吗
Do you know?

769
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,650
因为这是我唯一一次为我父亲骄傲
Because it's the one time I was proud of my father.

770
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:42,370
因为这个男人在这一刻  虽然可鄙
Because this man, in this moment, as despicable as it was,

771
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,630
在为生存而奋斗
is fighting to survive.

772
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,320
他不惜一切
He is doing whatever it took.

773
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,620
有没有你  我也会这样
And so will I, with or without you.

774
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,460
所以我不要跟你谈下去了
So no, I will not have this conversation.

775
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,250
我不会再纵容你了
I will not indulge you any further.

776
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,700
你得放弃
You have to let this go.

777
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,790
我可以参与你的竞选  也可以终结你的竞选
I can be a part of your campaign, or I can end it.

778
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,440
我也会不惜一切  就像你父亲那样
I'll do whatever it takes, too. Just like your father.

779
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,150
但我不会放弃
But I will not let this go.

780
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,030
给我备辆车去格林维尔机场
I'll need a car to the Greenville Airport.

781
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,950
去达拉斯  没错
To Dallas, yes.

783
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:54,400
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}在最先举行初选的几个关键州中
南卡罗来纳是黑人选民数量最多的一个州
尤其在民主党选民中  黑人更是占有非常大的比例
在2016年2月27日刚刚结束的南卡罗来纳州民主党选举中
出口民调显示61%的选民为黑人
所以民主党候选人只有赢得黑人的支持  才有可能拿下南卡
在本届选举的民主党初选中
希拉里·克林顿凭借丈夫在黑人社区中多年累积的人气和政治资本
赢得了86%的黑人选票
最终以84%对16%大胜对手佛蒙特州参议员桑德斯

785
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:34,400
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}在2016年大选中  也有候选人因与3K党的瓜葛而制造了大新闻
臭名昭著的前3K党头目戴维·杜克公开号召支持共和党候选人
纽约地产大亨唐纳德·特朗普
而特朗普在接受CNN专访时  在主持人的反复追问下  却拒绝同3K党划清界限
访谈播出后  引发了一波讨伐特朗普的声浪
虽然他过了很久后终于愿意同3K党划清界限
但许多共和党内的人士都认为他不适合继续参加总统竞选
在上届大选中赢得共和党党内初选的前马萨诸塞州州长米特·罗姆尼
高调发表讲话  号召党内选民不要投票给特朗普
然而共和党选民中黑人选民数量相对来说少得多
而特朗普在共和党初选中支持率高居不下
一定程度上是因为一些排斥移民并歧视少数裔的白人对他忠心耿耿
所以3K党访谈事件虽然让特朗普损失了一些粉丝
却没能阻止他在党内初选中继续领先

787
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:54,400
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}另外值得一提的是  在总统选举中
一个共识是候选人赢得"家乡州"是基本底线
弗兰克输掉了新罕布什尔  又在家门口栽了跟头  对他影响很大
在2016年的大选中  共和党候选人中特朗普一家独大
几个最有希望挑战他的党内候选人均面临很大压力
媒体认为除特朗普外的其余3名共和党候选人
如果不能在自己的家乡州取胜  那么将很难获得党内提名
