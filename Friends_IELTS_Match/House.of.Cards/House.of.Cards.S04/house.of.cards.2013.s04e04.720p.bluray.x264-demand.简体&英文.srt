但如果我们能扭转局面呢
But if we can move the needle...

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
提升40个百分点吗
Forty points?

35
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,160
要看我们怎么说
It's how we frame it.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,680
她的支持率不错  比我还高
Her favorables are decent. They're better than mine.

37
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,570
是对人不对事  就她作为联合国大使而言
In a void, but when it comes to her time as the UN ambassador,

38
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,470
支持率就猛跌了
they fall off a cliff.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,750
表现和经验是重要因素
Performance and experience are big factors.

40
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,610
那我们得强调她的优点而非软肋
Then we have to amplify her strengths, not her weaknesses.

41
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,310
我们需要一个有价值的副总统
We're looking for a VP who's an asset.

42
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,960
这项调查表明她不是
This research proves she isn't.

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,460
你的工作不是劝我放弃  而是想办法说服大家
Your job is not to dissuade me, but to figure out how we sell it.

44
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,200
先生  可选的人很多
Sir, there are so many people to choose from.

45
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,190
如果目标是获选
If the goal is to win,

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,190
-我们在不遗余力...  -赛斯
- and we're bending over backwards-- -Seth.

47
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,890
总统要我们制定计划
The president asked us to develop a plan,

48
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,330
那我们就制定计划
so that's what we'll do.

49
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,830
去我办公室等我
I'll meet you in my office.

50
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,820
-您知道他是对的  -当然了
- You know he's right. - Well, of course he's right.

51
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,150
或许我们可以给她点别的
Maybe we offer something else.

52
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,590
她不会听的
She won't listen.

53
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,720
莉安呢
What about LeAnn?

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,950
我也在考虑那个
Yes, I was thinking that, too.

55
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,190
问题是怎么让她配合
Question is how to co-opt her.

56
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,570
她喜欢支票
She likes paychecks.

57
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,750
不  光钱不行  她想要政治影响力
No, it's gotta be more than money. She wants coattails.

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,740
我跟克莱尔交换
We swap Claire's for mine.

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,310
-竞选经理吗  -我们需要新鲜血液
- Campaign manager? - We could use some fresh blood.

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,340
这我同意  但莉安
That I agree with, but LeAnn?

61
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,870
没法保证我们能控制她
I mean, there's no guarantee that we can control her.

62
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,700
但如果她能说服克莱尔改主意
Yeah, but if she can convince Claire to change her mind,

63
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,260
那对我就足够了
that's all I need.

64
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,730
是
Yes.

65
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,440
战况室都等您了  先生
They're ready for you in the Situation Room, sir.

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,690
我就过去
I'll be right there.

67
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,240
如果有必要你可以跟她合作
You could work with her if you had to.

68
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,560
我不非得喜欢她才能跟她合作
I don't have to like her to work with her.

69
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,370
-很好  打电话吧  -您还想让赛斯知情吗
- Good, make the call. - You still want Seth on the plan?

70
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,460
是的  直到莉安同意  我需要担心他吗
Yes, until LeAnn's on board. Do I have to worry about him?

71
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,570
我们挖得很深  他的电邮和手机记录没问题
We dug pretty deep. Nothing in his emails or phone records.

72
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,650
他聪明  知道掩盖踪迹
He's smart enough to cover his tracks.

73
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,650
我去跟他谈谈
I'll talk to him.

74
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,340
-你觉得这幅画如何  -我不知道
- What do you think of this painting? - I'm not sure.

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,240
沃克和我有一晚曾坐在这里  盯着挂在这儿
Walker and I sat here one night, stared up at a painting,

76
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,490
现在在总统办公室的那副蓝色的画看
the blue one that's in the Oval now.

77
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,300
这副是后换的
They replaced it with this.

78
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,370
那不是美国国旗
That's not the American flag.

79
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,380
不  是南军的旗
No, it's the rebel flag...

80
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,740
沉入虚无
sinking into oblivion.

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,530
那是闪电吗
Is that a lightning bolt?

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,550
我以为是的...
Oh, I assume...

83
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,530
除非是想把船画成独角兽还没画好
Unless it's just a bad attempt at making the ship a unicorn.

84
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,660
你看出来了吗
Do you see that?

85
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,710
色彩不错
Colors are nice.

86
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,520
我真不喜欢
I hate it.

87
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,010
那我也不喜欢
I guess I hate it, too.

88
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,550
我想在白宫
I suppose it's not a good idea to have

89
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,720
挂联邦旗大概不是个好主意
the Confederate flag hanging here in the White House

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
尤其经历了南卡的事
after everything that's happened in South Carolina.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,760
虽然它是在下沉
Even if it is sinking.

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,740
你觉得我们该挂什么
What do you think we should put up?

93
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,850
我不知道  您更喜欢的东西
I don't know. Something you like better.

94
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,480
你带那支我签字的马克笔了吗
Do you have that marker I sign things with?

95
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,920
把你的手放在墙上
Put your hand up on the wall.

96
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,330
-先生  -放在墙上
- Sir? - Put it on the wall.

97
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,390
手指伸开一点
Spread your fingers a little bit.

98
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,380
等等  好了
Wait. Okay.

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,620
嗯  今天就玩到这儿吧
Yeah... That's enough fun for today. -

100
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,850
道格  我不知道该怎么做到他要我做的事
Doug, I don't know how to do what he's asking me to do.

101
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,260
-没有魔法...  -泄露事件
- There is not some magical-- - The leaks.

102
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,180
-是你吗  -你认真的吗
- Was it you? - Are you serious?

103
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,360
非常认真
Very.

104
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,160
我像其他人一样上交了我的通讯记录
I handed over all of my correspondence, just like everyone else.

105
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,840
那不能证明什么
Doesn't prove anything.

106
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,530
我是在挽救他的竞选
I'm trying to save this campaign.

107
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,350
如果我想搞破坏  让总统自己来就好
If I wanted to sabotage it, I'd let the president do it himself,

108
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,450
而不是在副总统的事上跟他对着干
instead of fighting back on this VP thing.

109
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,710
或许那只是装样子
Or that's just a cover.

110
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,150
去年你不在的时候
I've been in the trenches for the past year

111
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,220
我一直在第一线  现在你还怀疑我
while you've been gone, and now you doubt me?

112
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,000
我不需要这套
I don't need this.

113
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,740
你得到这份工作是靠挖丑事
You got this job by digging up dirt.

114
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,580
如果你到现在还不信任我
If you can't trust me by now,

115
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,950
我不知道我还在这儿干吗
I don't know what I'm doing here.

116
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,110
你是说你想辞职吗
Are you saying you wanna resign?

117
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,080
那是我最不想的了
That is the last thing that I want,

118
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,990
但你没有给我留下的动力
but you're not giving me any incentive to stay.

119
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,810
好吧  去它的
All right. Fuck it.

120
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,240
赛斯  我现在选择信任你
Seth, I'm choosing to believe you right now,

121
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,560
但如果我有一日感到后悔了
but if I come to regret that decision--

122
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,980
你不会的  因为不是我干的
You won't, because it's not me.

123
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,920
我还是认为密查姆有可能
I still think it could be Meechum.

124
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,050
不是他
It wasn't.

125
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,170
-你确定  -完全确定
- You're sure? - I'm positive.

126
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,950
总统也确定
And so is the president.

127
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,680
我可以走了吗
May I go?

128
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,730
还是你想谈谈第一夫人的计划
Or did you want to discuss the plan for the First Lady?

129
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,200
我要打电话  我稍后去你办公室
I have some calls to make. I'll come to your office after.

130
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,220
给我接莉安·哈维
Get me LeAnn Harvey.

131
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,380
米尔金将住在他家  安东·考斯基
Milkin will be staying with this man, Anton Khalski.

132
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,530
他原本拥有俄罗斯第二大的银行
He owned the second-largest bank in Russia

133
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,890
直到2013年被佩特罗夫查抄
until Petrov seized it in 2013.

134
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,980
考斯基逃出国境去了爱沙尼亚
Khalski fled across the border to Estonia.

135
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,210
我们让米尔金的飞机飞往首都塔林
We'll have Milkin's plane fly to Tallinn,

136
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,160
然后他会乘船去萨拉马考斯基的夏季别墅
then he'll travel by boat to Khalski's summer house on Saaremaa.

137
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,160
明天  我们将解冻米尔金的美国财产
Tomorrow we'll unfreeze Milkin's American assets

138
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,600
并转移至考斯基的瑞士账户
and transfer them to Khalski's Swiss accounts.

139
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,050
考斯基会联络他的俄罗斯军队朋友
Khalski will reach out to his Russian military friends

140
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,800
然后开始收买他们
and then start buying them off.

141
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,810
俄联邦安全局在监控考斯基吗
Are the FSB monitoring Khalski?

142
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,000
密切监控  他们会知道是我们在支持他
Closely. They'll know we're behind this.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,320
-莫斯科如果质问我们呢  -当然是否认
- When Moscow confronts us? - We'll deny, of course.

144
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,410
如果佩特罗夫反应过激  我们是否有所准备
Are we prepared if Petrov overreacts?

145
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,210
第六舰队在博斯普鲁斯海峡附近有部属
The Sixth Fleet has a presence near the Bosphorus,

146
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,830
我们在北海也有巡航
we have patrols in the North Sea.

147
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,830
-起草命令吧  -先生  可以说一句吗
- Draft the order. - Sir, if I may?

148
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,990
-我们讨论过了  凯茜  -是的  先生
- Yeah, we've discussed this, Cathy. - Yes, sir.

149
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,660
我觉得我必须
I feel obligated

150
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,900
要提出强烈的反对  这将给我们带来的外交影响
to raise my very strong objections. The diplomatic cost to us--

151
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,060
如果外交好用
If diplomacy were working,

152
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,680
我们根本就不需要考虑这么做了  是吧
we wouldn't have to consider this course of action, would we?

153
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,890
-我已经提出了担忧  -谢谢大家
- I've voiced my concerns. - Thank you, everyone.

154
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,090
你不会突然让
You're not going to surprise me

155
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,220
总统接电话打我个措手不及吧
by putting the president on, are you?

156
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,020
不  只有我们  但他告诉我了
No, it's just us. He filled me in, though,

157
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,450
-关于第一夫人的要求  -怎么样
- on the First Lady's request. - And?

158
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,050
我们想让你当竞选经理
We wanna make you campaign manager.

159
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,280
看你的邮件
Look at your email.

160
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,800
-是什么  -我们的调研
- What is this? - Our research.

161
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,130
结果是一样的
It all boils down to the same thing.

162
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,390
你们做了几个民调  又如何
You ran a few polls, so what?

163
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,130
-还有焦点小组  -毫无意义
- Focus groups, too. - Meaningless.

164
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,610
这么低的数字可不是毫无意义
Not these numbers.

165
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,080
克莱尔不能参选  你很清楚
Claire can't be on the ticket. You know she can't.

166
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,450
这事不是孤立的
This isn't something you can isolate on its own.

167
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,620
如果油价飙升至6美元/加仑  你们就完了
If gas prices hit $6 a gallon, you're fucked.

168
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,050
-你们会失去所有关键人群  -我们很清楚
- You lose every key demo. - We're well aware.

169
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,820
但如果总统让克莱尔做他的竞选搭档
But if the president makes Claire his running mate,

170
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,260
那么话题会转向策略而非经济
it makes the conversation tactical instead of economic.

171
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,020
这就给了你们时间处理俄罗斯危机
That buys you time on the Russia crisis.

172
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,980
你们解决了那事  对总统的自信
You solve that, confidence in the president

173
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,100
就能转变成对总统选择的自信
translates into confidence in his choice--

174
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,930
我打给你不是想听你游说
I didn't call you to be convinced.

175
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,000
我打来是想给你份工作
I called to offer you a job.

176
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,150
-是为了拆安德伍德夫人的台  -不仅是因为她
- Only to get to Mrs. Underwood. -This isn't just about her.

177
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,920
我们需要你  你能扭转竞选局势
We need you. You'll turn this campaign around.

178
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,710
我好惊讶  道格  我以为你不怎么喜欢我呢
I'm surprised, Doug. I didn't think you were very fond of me.

179
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,130
我喜欢人才  总统也是
I'm fond of talent. So is the president.

180
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,930
我忠于第一夫人
My loyalty is to the First Lady.

181
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,200
我只求你跟她谈谈
All I'm asking is that you talk to her.

182
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,500
这样吧  如果你把我的调查给总统看
I'll tell you what. I'll show Claire your research

183
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,270
我就把你的调查给克莱尔看
if you show the president mine.

184
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,070
这我可以同意
I can agree to that.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,210
我根本不该跟你说话的  希瑟
I shouldn't even be talking to you, Heather.

186
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,490
我非常担忧有滥用职权的现象
I'm seriously concerned that there's been an abuse of power.

187
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,850
司法部长女士  斯坦普先生可以见您了
Madam Attorney General? Mr. Stamper, um, is ready to see you now.

188
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,030
我就去
I'll be right there.

189
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,690
我得挂了
I gotta go.

190
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,280
负责行动的探员
The agent in charge of the operation

191
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,900
事后马上得到了晋升
got a promotion directly after.

192
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,700
-听着  -玛莎  如果总统
- Listen-- - Martha, if the president,

193
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,890
或他的手下  如果有人强迫联调局
or one of his staff... If anyone strong-armed the bureau

194
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,810
追查卢卡斯·古德温
into pursuing Lucas Goodwin,

195
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,140
你知道  那就是滥用职权
then you know that's an abuse of power.

196
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,760
我就为总统工作
I work for the president.

197
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,210
我正要跟他的幕僚长面谈
I am about to sit down with his Chief of Staff.

198
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,240
-法律就是法律  -这是政治  不是法律
- The law is the law. - This is politics, not the law.

199
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,750
不对  你让我担任
Not true. You brought me on

200
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,040
副检察长是因为我正直
as solicitor general because of my integrity.

201
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,120
而我来找你  是因为你也一样
I am bringing this to you because of yours.

202
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,420
司法部长女士
Madam Attorney General.

203
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,910
我真的得挂了
I really need to go.

204
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,600
如果古德温的故事有一丝真实性
If a sliver of Goodwin's story holds up...

205
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,950
你怎么知道的
How did you even find this?

206
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,930
你的对手研究团队联络过证人保护计划的人吗
Did your oppo team speak to someone in WITSEC?

207
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,310
如果是那样  这种违法行为...
Because if that's the case, then that sort of breach is not--

208
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,430
-我跟他本人谈过  -什么
- I spoke to him myself, personally. - You what?

209
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,310
他来找我的  他找到了我
He came to me. He tracked me down.

210
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,300
我不要沾这事  希瑟
I'm not touching this, Heather.

211
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,160
道格  真是抱歉
Doug, sorry about that.

212
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,080
-没事  -我刚刚在跟首席法官通话
- No-- - I was just on with the Chief Justice.

213
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,810
-没事的  快进来吧  -谢谢
- Don't be silly, come on in. - Thank you.

214
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,420
-这边请  -谢谢你
- This way. - Thanks so much.

215
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,120
我不知道  她当大使时表现可不怎么样
I don't know. She didn't do that well as ambassador.

216
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,750
经验不够
She wasn't experienced enough.

217
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,440
等等  她做过大使
Hold on, she was an ambassador?

218
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,460
-联合国大使  -克里斯  你不看新闻吗
- At the United Nations. - Chris, don't you watch the news?

219
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,390
你们多少人也有同感
How many of you feel the same?

220
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,170
除了缺乏经验  有其他原因吗
Any other reasons, besides lack of experience?

221
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,300
她在莫斯科情绪失控时很冲动
Well, she was really impulsive when she had that outburst in Moscow.

222
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,350
她根本就不该去
Well, she never should've been there in the first place.

223
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,520
参议院都否决了她
I mean, the Senate voted her down,

224
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,040
她丈夫还是任命了她
and then her husband just appoints her?

225
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,340
哪能这样
That's not right.

226
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,860
瞧  我喜欢她这个人  但我同意
Okay, see, I like her as a person, but I agree,

227
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,670
她该继续做她的第一夫人
she should stick to being First Lady.

228
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,360
他是希望你来劝我放弃
So, he's hoping you'll convince me to let it go.

229
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,650
我能挣得比你给的多得多
Look, I'd make a killing compared to what you've paid me,

230
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,390
但我们谈过要有所成就
but you and I talked about making a real mark.

231
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,790
我父亲真的很喜欢弗兰西斯
My father really liked Francis.

232
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,970
但作为我父亲  我们结婚前一天  他跟我说
But as my daddy, he said to me, the day before we got married,

233
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,840
"你只有一次人生  克莱尔
"You have one life, Claire.

234
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,760
你确定你要跟这个男人共度此生吗"
Are you sure this is the man you wanna spend it with?"

235
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,220
你怎么说的
What did you say?

236
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,760
我说我不想在怀疑中度过人生
I said I didn't want to live my life full of doubts.

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,210
我觉得弗兰西斯想让我怀疑自己
Well, I think Francis wants me to doubt myself.

238
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,770
-怎么回事  -我母亲  杀蜥蜴呢
- What was that? - My mother... killing a lizard.

239
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,770
-我给您开门  夫人  -我自己能开
- I'll get the door for you, ma'am. - I can open the door myself.

240
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,690
小心脚下  地上有血
Watch your step. There's blood on the floor.

241
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,390
我要你亲自把这个交给总统
I want you to take this to the president, in person.

242
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,080
-如果可以  今晚飞过去  -当然
- Try to get on a plane tonight if you can. - Of course.

243
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,460
这是给你的
This one's for you.

244
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,740
-是温的  -至少是免费的
- It's warm. - At least it's free.

245
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,600
我或许得要你们兑现保险了
I may need to cash in my insurance.

246
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,290
怎么了
What's going on?

247
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,390
如果她拿下提名  我会得到什么位置
Tell me what my position would be if she wins the nomination.

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,100
是司法部长吗
Is it the attorney general?

249
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,690
-什么  -算了
- The what? - Never mind.

250
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,130
做竞选搭档吗
For running mate?

251
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,980
现在考虑竞选搭档太早了  他还没赢呢
It's way too early for running mates. He hasn't even won.

252
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,580
-我们说的是一件事吗  -你先说
- Are we talking about the same thing? - You go first.

253
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,460
事不是那么办的
It doesn't work that way.

254
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,050
是你想找工作
Well, you're the one looking for a job.

255
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,350
你要么告诉我
You can either involve me,

256
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,030
要么就等着
or you can start reading

257
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,460
报纸头条报道邓巴泄露婚姻消息
headlines about Dunbar pushing a marriage story.

258
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,830
那会害死你的
That would blow you up.

259
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,460
道格已经起疑了  我没什么好怕的
Doug's already suspicious. I've got nothing to lose.

260
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,010
怎么样
So which is it?

261
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,070
卢卡斯·古德温
Lucas Goodwin.

262
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,120
他是《先驱报》的编辑  是那个...
He was an editor... at The Herald, the one who--

263
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,710
-我们跟他谈过  -他不是在蹲监狱吗
- We spoke to him. - Isn't he in prison?

264
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,640
出来了
Not anymore.

265
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,460
他将于9:30出发
He's scheduled to depart at 0930 hours.

266
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,020
破晓前不久就能到塔林
That'll put him in Tallinn shortly before dawn.

267
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,170
我们的站长与去萨拉马的护送队在待命了
Our station chief is standing by with the escort to Saaremaa.

268
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,810
这是行政命令
This is the executive order.

269
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,230
-长官  -凯茜  我已经决定了
- Sir-- - Cathy, I've made my decision.

270
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,450
-他到达后每小时报告一次  -是  先生
- Hourly updates once he lands. - Yes, sir.

271
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,190
非常感谢
Thank you all very much.

272
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,110
告诉道格我准备好了
Tell Doug I'm ready.

273
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,900
请坐吧  莉安
Please, have a seat, LeAnn.

274
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,070
我很高兴你同意加入了
I'm delighted you've agreed to come on board.

275
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,270
据我所知是有条件的
It's my understanding there is a condition attached.

276
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,770
是的
Well, yes.

277
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,330
她明白这个条件吧  你跟她谈过了
And she understands that condition? You've spoken with her?

278
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,360
抱歉  先生  我没说清楚
Oh, my apologies, sir. I wasn't clear.

279
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,730
我是指我们的条件  不是你们的
I meant our condition, not yours.

280
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,550
在初选日
On Super Tuesday.

281
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,060
这么大老远亲自送来啊
It's a long trip to deliver this in person.

282
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,520
这种东西
Well, it's not the sort of thing

283
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,690
可不能落入旁人手中
you'd want to end up in the wrong hands.

284
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,190
你要留在华盛顿吗
Are you staying here in Washington?

285
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,200
不  我马上回去
No, I'm going straight back.

286
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,280
有什么话需要我带给第一夫人吗
Is there anything you'd like me to tell the First Lady?

287
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,820
告诉她今晚就能回复她
Tell her she'll have her answer by this evening.

288
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,240
谢谢  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

289
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,050
归程一路顺风  哈维小姐
Have a safe trip back, Ms. Harvey.

290
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,010
我自己出去吧
I'll show myself out.

291
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,200
相当长的一段时间以来  我和总统已经渐渐疏远
For quite some time, the president and I have been growing apart.

292
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,750
让密查姆进来
Have Meechum step in here.

293
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,710
我们曾企图挽救我们的婚姻
We've attempted to save our marriage,

294
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,540
但虽经过很多努力  我最终认识到
but after great effort, I've come to the conclusion

295
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,280
我们的婚姻已不可挽救
that it can't be saved.

296
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,460
我今天很遗憾地宣布
It is with great regret that I announce today

297
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,800
我将申请离婚
I'm filing for divorce.

298
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,250
-我们得阻止她  -在她到机场之前吗
- We have to stop her. - Before she gets to the airport?

299
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,020
不是  克莱尔
No, I mean Claire.

300
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,250
您找我  先生
You asked for me, sir?

301
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,780
进来
Come in.

302
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,730
手机和固话...
Both the cell and the landline--

303
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,030
我们进入了封锁  夫人  我们屏蔽了...
We're on lockdown, ma'am. We had to scramble all the--

304
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,870
封锁  你在说什么呢
Lockdown? What are you talking about?

305
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,590
请您待在房内
I'm gonna need you to stay in the house.

306
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,490
-什么  -抱歉  夫人
- What-- - I'm sorry, ma'am.

307
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,950
你不能强迫我留在屋内
You can't force me to stay in here.

308
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,340
现在有针对您很可信的威胁...
There is a current, highly credible threat to your life--

309
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,660
我要跟你的上级说话
I need to speak to your supervising--

310
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,490
我是您在达拉斯的保安主管  夫人
I am the head of your detail here in Dallas, ma'am,

311
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,050
我得到命令要保护您安全留在屋内
and I've been ordered to keep you securely in this house.

312
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,700
安德伍德加油
Go Underwood!

313
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,420
-听啊  -笨蛋伍德  笨蛋伍德
- Listen. - Blunderwood! Blunderwood!

314
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,020
知道他们喊什么吗  "笨蛋伍德"
Do you know what they're chanting? "Blunderwood."

315
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,040
如果我是他们的英语教授
And if I were their English professor,

316
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,480
我会给他们的小聪明打A
why, I would give them all an "A" for cleverness...

317
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,970
但准确性打D
...but a "D" for accuracy.

318
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,480
但做总统就是如此
But that's part of being president.

319
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,330
会树敌
You make enemies,

320
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,580
大家此刻就能听到我的一些敌人在外面呐喊
and you can hear some of mine just outside, right now.

321
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,350
所以我很感激你们每个人
So, I am grateful to each and every one of you

322
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,290
今天前来表示对我的支持
for coming out and showing your support today.

323
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,220
因为你们  我们能拿到提名
It's because of you we will win this nomination,

324
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,930
所以我今天来你们大学
and that's why I came to your college today.

325
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,900
当然了  我知道
Now, of course, I knew

326
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,300
今天会有抗议者来
that there would be protesters here today...

327
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,930
我本可以不来
and I could've chosen not to come,

328
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,080
也可以选择离开时避开他们
or I could choose to avoid them as I leave,

329
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,140
但我不打算那么做
but I'm not going to do that,

330
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,440
因为外面那些学生  你们的同学
because those students out there, your fellow classmates,

331
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,420
我也是他们的总统
I'm their president, too.

332
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,340
不管他们是不是为我投票  我也得带领他们
And whether they vote for me or not, I have to lead them as well.

333
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,850
所以  一定得倾听他们  跟他们说话
So, it's important to hear them, to talk to them,

334
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,160
听他们的想法
to listen to their ideas,

335
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,740
因为就像你们在大学学习
because, just as you're learning in college,

336
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,610
思想的多样化让我们都更加明智
a diversity of ideas makes us all wiser,

337
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,840
对你们的总统来说也是如此
and that holds true even for your president.

338
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,010
真正的领导
True leadership

339
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,170
不是逃避与你意见相左的人
is not running away from those who disagree with you,

340
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
而是要接纳他们
but embracing them,

341
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,990
今天结束后  我就打算这么做
and that is exactly what I intend to do when I'm done today.

342
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,650
我要出去接纳那群人
I'm gonna go out and embrace that entire crowd.

343
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,610
我们不该坐军用飞机吗
Shouldn't we be taking a military plane?

344
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,880
那会吸引注意
That would draw attention.

345
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,540
放松
Relax.

346
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,590
一切都安排好了  你不会有事的
Everything's been worked out. You're in good hands.

347
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,120
给  睡会儿吧
Here, get some sleep.

348
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,910
今晚要走很久
It's gonna be a long trip tonight.

349
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,680
笨蛋伍德  笨蛋伍德
Blunderwood! Blunderwood!

350
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,500
-有消息吗  -都安排好了  先生
- Any news? - Everything's secure, sir.

351
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,630
我们爱你  安德伍德
We love you, Underwood!

352
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,540
感谢大家前来
Thank you all for coming out,

353
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,030
包括那些不完全支持我的人
even those of you who don't entirely support me.

354
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,940
-总统先生你真棒  -谢谢
- Way to go, Mr. President! - Thank you.

355
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,970
我想尽量听听你们究竟反对我什么
I wanna try to hear what it is that you disagree with me about.

356
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,090
我知道不是每个人都支持我
I understand not everyone's for me.

357
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,430
-停止战争  -滚回加夫尼去吧
- No more wars! - Go back to Gaffney!

358
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,630
你好吗  谢谢你能来
Hello, how are you? Thank you for coming out.

359
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,840
你好  谢谢你能来
Hello, thank you for coming out.

360
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,310
-你很棒  -我们知道你的真实面目
- You're doing a great job! - We know what you are!

361
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,760
你好
Hello.

362
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,220
好了  我来是想听听你们的声音
All right, I'm here to try to listen to you,

363
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,060
但是一个一个说可能会比较好
but probably one at a time is gonna be a little better.

364
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,320
也许我们应该进行一对一的对话
Okay, maybe we could have a conversation, more one-on-one.

365
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,760
这样很难听清
It's difficult to hear you.

366
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,760
我知道你们不喜欢什么  但你们支持什么呢
I understand what you don't believe in, but what are you for?

367
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,470
这样问也许比较好  你怎么样
That would be a good question. All right, how about you?

368
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,280
你已经冲我喊了有一会儿了
You've been yelling at me for a little while.

369
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,810
你觉得我该在哪些方面有所改变
What do you think I should be doing differently?

370
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,100
-你应该辞职  -好吧
- You should resign. - Well, now,

371
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,680
我没在请求你为我投票
I'm not asking for your vote,

372
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,660
但如果你是总统  你会怎么做呢
but what would you do if you were president?

373
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,410
你在毁掉我们的国家
You're ruining our country!

374
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,790
我来这里是想听你们的心声
I came out here to try to listen to what you wanna say,

375
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,230
但如果你们只是一直尖叫下去
but if all you're gonna do is scream--

376
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,750
有枪
Gun!

377
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,780
-快走  -快带他走
- Let's go! - Get him out of here.

378
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,750
-快走  快走  -走走走
- Move! Move! - Go, go, go!

379
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,000
有人企图刺杀总统
There has been an attempted assassination of the president.

380
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,520
弗兰克·安德伍德总统遭到了枪击
President Frank Underwood has been shot.

381
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,330
大约十分钟前发生于华盛顿特区
It occurred about ten minutes ago during a campaign event

382
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,520
哈蒙德大学的一场竞选活动中
at Hammond University in Washington, D.C.

383
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,060
我们尚不清楚总统的伤情有多重
We do not yet know how severely the president has been wounded.

384
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,640
他正在被送往杰弗逊纪念医院
He is en route to Jefferson Memorial Hospital.

385
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,720
我们不知道他的情况有多严重
We don't know how serious his condition may be.

386
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,240
刺杀未遂事件的视频还没送到
Footage of the assassination attempt is still making its way to us,

387
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,540
但相信很快就能够公布
and we expect to have that shortly.

388
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,360
目击者声称
Witnesses are reporting

389
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,840
当时有连续好几声枪响
that there was a quick succession of gunshots,

390
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,150
约有四五发
four or five,

391
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,870
枪手是一个人  身份还未确认
a lone gunman whose identity we are still trying to determine.

392
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,340
已得知枪手已被击毙
We've been told the gunman was killed,

393
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,510
另有至少一名特勤人员遇难
as well as at least one Secret Service agent,

394
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,280
但我们还未得到明确证实
but we don't have definitive confirmation of that yet.

395
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,390
我们也不清楚枪手和特勤人员的身份
We don't yet know who the gunman may be or who the agent is.

396
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,520
-怎么了  -总统遇刺了
- What's happened? - The president's been shot.

397
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,040
导播现在告诉我
I'm hearing now that the president

398
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,620
总统至少腹部中了一枪  也许不止
received at least one gunshot to the abdomen, possibly more,

399
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,740
他紧捂腹部
that he clutched his stomach,

400
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,030
立即倒地
that he fell instantly to the ground,

401
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,980
现场尖叫连连  人群陷入恐慌
and there were screams, people panicking,

402
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,650
场面十分混乱
that it has been very chaotic at that scene.

403
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,950
目前我们获得的消息很有限
We have very little information at this time,

404
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,740
仅知道总统遭遇枪击受伤
other than shots were fired, the president wounded.

405
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
但如我所言  他还活着
But as I say, he is alive.

406
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,740
我们也还没得到
We've gotten no official

407
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,760
白宫的官方声明
statement from the White House as of yet,

408
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,860
不了解总统的具体情况
either the president's precise condition

409
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,870
或是布莱斯副总统的行踪
or the whereabouts of Vice President Blythe.

410
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,530
有消息称他目前在白宫  但我们还不能确认
He is believed to be at the White House. We cannot confirm that,

411
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,110
我们也不清楚他是否会出任代总统
nor do we know if he will take over as acting president,

412
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,890
遵照宪法第25条修正案
assuming the duties of the presidency under the terms

413
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,490
承担总统的职责
of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.

414
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,570
但如果总统的伤势
That would seem likely, however,

415
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,080
如我们认为的那样严重
if the president's wounds are as serious

416
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,880
这将很有可能
as we believe them to be.

417
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,920
这是国家的艰难时刻
This is a difficult moment for the country.

418
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,710
这不是我国总统第一次遇刺
It is not the first time that a president has been shot

419
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,540
我和很多人此前都曾经历过
in my lifetime or in many of yours.

420
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,020
但即便对那些经历过这种事的人
But even for those of us who have experienced this before,

421
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,850
此事仍触目惊心  骇人听闻
it is no less of a shock, it is no less terrifying.

422
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,640
这是检验我国坚韧的时刻
It is the moment when our nation's resilience,

423
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,220
检验人民团结的时刻
when our collective strength,

424
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,790
最能检验一切的时刻
the moment when all of that is tested the most.

425
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,330
我们难以想象
And we can only imagine

426
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,250
第一夫人此时多么痛苦
how difficult it must be for the First Lady.

427
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,120
-弗兰西斯他...  -迈克尔说了
- Francis-- - Michael told me.

428
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,950
我得回华盛顿
I have to go back to Washington.

429
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,460
那你还耽搁什么
Well, what are you waiting for?

430
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,990
还指望我安慰你吗
Do you expect me to console you?

431
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,890
不  我只是...
No, I just...

432
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,980
-再见  母亲  -克莱尔
- Goodbye, Mother. - Claire.

433
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,600
我希望他死
I hope he dies.

434
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,930
克莱尔  我无法想象你多么难过
Claire, I can't imagine how difficult this must be.

435
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,430
需要我帮忙吗
Is there anything I can do?

436
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,470
谢谢你来电慰问  副总统先生
I appreciate the call, Mr. Vice President,

437
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,050
但你眼下肯定还有许多事得处理
but I'm sure you've got a lot to take care of right now.

438
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,010
你需要我的帮助吗
Is there anything I can do to help you?

439
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,460
等我们弄清目前的状况
I'll be making a brief appearance once we have a better sense of...

440
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,960
我就会进行简短发言
where things stand.

441
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,640
需要我在场吗
Would you like me to be there?

442
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,220
这样最好  让国家见到第一夫人
I think it would be good, the country seeing the First Lady.

443
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,120
我觉得让他们见到你临危不乱更重要
I think it's more important that they see your steady hand.

444
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,550
如果你在我身边  我会更有底气
If you're by my side, it would certainly make it steadier.

445
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,770
当然  我都听你的
Of course. Anything you ask.

446
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,690
我会为你们祈祷  为你们俩
I'm gonna be praying for you. For both of you.

447
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,040
谢谢  唐
Thank you, Don.

448
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,230
好了
Okay.

449
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,380
这边请  先生
This way, sir.

450
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,910
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

451
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,840
有高度机密事务
The acting president needs

452
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,010
需要向代总统报告
to be briefed on a highly classified matter.

453
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,740
没有军事机密权限的人请离开房间
Everyone without military clearance, we'll need the room.

454
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,860
枪手开了两枪
It was in fact two shots.

455
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,320
一枪擦伤了身体  就在右臂之下
One that grazed the torso just beneath the right arm

456
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,680
另一枪射入了腹部
and the second which entered the abdomen,

457
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,510
多半伤了肝脏
possibly into his liver.

458
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,790
显然是这一枪造成了最严重的伤害
Obviously, it was that shot that did the greatest damage.

459
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,800
据悉  总统目前情况危急
The president is currently reported to be in critical condition.

460
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,630
为保护总统遇害的
The Secret Service agent

461
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,540
特勤局特工名叫艾德华·密查姆
that was killed protecting the president was Edward Meechum.

462
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,300
他是总统安保队队长
He is the head of the president's detail,

463
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,140
我们现在可以确定
and we can confirm that now.

464
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,100
他中枪后  在死前
After being shot and before he died,

465
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,480
杀死了身份仍未知的袭击者
he killed the assailant whose identity is still unknown.

466
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,040
我们正在等待白宫新闻发言人赛斯·格雷森
We're waiting now on a press conference from the White House

467
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,520
召开新闻发布会
from Press Secretary Seth Grayson,

468
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,290
发布会稍后就将举行
and we expect to have that beginning in just a few moments.

469
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,550
先给我看过两遍  再对外确认
We confirm nothing unless you run it past me twice first,

470
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,680
-我不希望...  -格雷森先生...
- I don't want-- - Mr. Grayson...

471
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,940
马上过去  不要有任何传言  只要事实
I'm on my way. We don't want any rumors, only facts.

472
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,620
有名学生宣称是特勤局的人
There's a student who's claiming it was the Secret Service

473
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,820
-开的第一枪  -我刚说了什么
- who fired the first shot. - What did I just say?

474
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,350
-别拿这种屁话浪费我时间  -先生
- Do not waste my time with that bullshit. - Sir,

475
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,230
媒体在等了
the press is waiting.

476
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,300
行  我马上过去  我的...
All right, I'm... I'm coming. Uh, where's my...

477
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,590
今日午后12:38  副总统唐纳德·布莱斯
At 12:38 this afternoon, Vice President Donald Blythe

478
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,070
由内阁任命为代总统
was authorized as acting president by the cabinet.

479
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,830
目前他正与内阁会面
He is currently meeting with them.

480
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,500
约20分钟前  第一夫人在安德鲁空军基地降落
Approximately 20 minutes ago, the First Lady landed at Andrews.

481
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,210
她不久就会达到医院
She is expected to arrive at the hospital shortly.

482
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,300
-安德伍德夫人  -他怎么样
- Mrs. Underwood. - How is he?

483
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,420
他们还在手术室里  大概还得要几小时
They're still in the OR. Probably a few hours left to go.

484
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,660
他能保住命吗
Is he going to live?

485
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,530
他被直接击中肝脏  肝脏部分破裂
He took a direct hit to his liver, which is partially shattered.

486
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,210
幸运的是  左叶有一部分几乎完好无损
Fortunately, part of the left lobe is mostly intact.

487
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,500
我们认为  他有很大几率挺过手术
Now, we think there's a decent chance he will survive surgery,

488
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,530
但即便如此  真正的难关在术后才开始
but even if he does, that's when the real fight begins.

489
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,940
我想见他
I'd like to see him.

490
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,760
手术一结束我就告诉您
As soon as he's out, I'll make sure you know.

491
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,080
好  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

492
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,320
我建议取消这次行动
I'd recommend we call off this operation,

493
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,050
现在就让飞机调头
we turn the plane around now.

494
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,140
我不同意  我们精心计划过了
I disagree. It's well planned.

495
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,390
而且总统已经签字了
The president already signed off.

496
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,240
总统可能挺不过来
The president might die.

497
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,190
-国务卿女士  -不准这样说  凯茜
- Madam Secretary... - We'll have no talk like that, Cathy.

498
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,430
抱歉  先生
My apologies, sir.

499
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,580
我想说的是
What I am trying to say is that

500
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,710
针锋相对的风险太大了
it is too risky to antagonize--

501
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,380
我们的目的是吓唬他们  不是
The point was to scare them, not--

502
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,840
在最高指挥官
To do anything of this nature

503
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,440
无法工作时做这种事
while the commander in chief is incapacitated,

504
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,380
-俄罗斯人会利用这时机  -我们现在高度警戒
- the Russians will take advantage-- - We're at high alert.

505
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,250
我们准备好面对一切可能了
We're prepared for all eventualities.

506
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,120
{\an8}不能把军队当成故障保险
We don't want the military to be the fail-safe here.

507
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,350
副...总统先生
Mr. Vice... Mr. President...

508
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,050
我认为  执行总统签署的命令
I believe it is our duty to carry out the orders

509
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,610
是我们的职责
that the president signed.

510
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,690
-情况已经变了  -计划依然可行
- The circumstances have changed. - The plan is sound.

511
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,610
您想怎么办  先生
So, what would you like to do, sir,

512
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,600
继续还是终止任务
continue the mission or abort?

513
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,780
我想再考虑考虑
Uh, I... I wanna think on it.

514
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,210
按计划他将在两小时后降落
He's scheduled to land in two hours.

515
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,430
我只想
I just want...

516
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,570
我得考虑一下  我们休息一下吧
I've gotta think. Let's take a break.

517
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,320
我得整理整理思绪
I, uh, I need to process all this.

518
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,560
先生
Sir?

519
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,340
总统权衡过一切
The president weighed everything--

520
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,270
凯茜说得很有道理
Cathy brought up some good points.

521
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,230
她从最开始就反对这件事
She's been against this from the very beginning,

522
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,040
但总统明确
but the president clearly--

523
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,330
给我点时间  道格  求你了
Just give me some time, Doug, please?

524
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,020
在我耳边吼的人太多了
I've got too many people barking in my ear.

525
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,900
总统已经做完手术
The president is out of surgery,

526
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,520
他病情稳定但依然危重
and he is in stable but critical condition.

527
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,480
听我说  听我说  我们要有序得来
Excuse me! Excuse me! We are going to keep this orderly.

528
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,350
先让萨克逊医生发表完声明
Dr. Saxon will finish his statement,

529
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,780
然后我们再回答你们的问题  谢谢
and then we'll answer your questions. Thank you.

530
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,450
手术进行了6小时28分钟
The surgery lasted six hours, 28 minutes.

531
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,540
切除了四分之三的肝脏
Three quarters of his liver was removed.

532
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,000
肝脏  哪怕只剩四分之一
A liver, even one quarter of a liver,

533
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,760
都有能力在六至八周内再生
has the ability to regenerate within six to eight weeks.

534
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,610
我们每小时都会对他进行血检
We will be conducting blood tests every hour.

535
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,680
监测肝酶水平  血氨水平  凝血酶原时间
Enzymes, ammonia levels, PT times,

536
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,110
这些在声明材料上都有说明
I believe these are all explained in the handout.

537
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,040
...医学报告  我们马上就继续
...the medical report, live from the White House,

538
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,070
白宫的现场直播
which we will return to shortly.

539
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,880
但我们在密切关注一则重大新闻
But we have breaking news we're following.

540
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,710
此前的报道称  未遂刺客是
The would-be assassin was previously reported

541
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,620
俄亥俄州代顿的约翰·卡莱尔
as John Carlyle from Dayton, Ohio,

542
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,050
但现在司法部的消息源称
but sources in the Department of Justice now say

543
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,290
这其实是卢卡斯·古德温的化名
this was actually an alias for Lucas Goodwin,

544
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,140
他曾是《华盛顿先驱报》的编辑
a former editor at The Washington Herald

545
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,220
两年前被判犯下了网络恐怖主义罪
who was convicted of cyberterrorism nearly two years ago.

546
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,970
如果我们暂停这段手机拍摄的枪击视频
Now, if we freeze this cell phone footage of the shooting

547
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,750
然后将枪手的脸与古德温的照片进行对比
and we compare the shooter's face to this picture of Goodwin...

548
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,730
对比结果惊人
well, the comparison is striking

549
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,050
似乎也证实了
and would seem to confirm

550
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,160
来自司法部消息源的说法
what we're hearing from our sources in the DOJ,

551
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,580
即古德温已于近日获释
who say Goodwin was recently released

552
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,100
并加入了证人保护计划
and is in a witness protection program.

553
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,070
感觉好怪  想到我...
It's so strange to think that I--

554
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,900
多久  也就两小时前吧  还不到
It was, what? Just two hours before? Less than.

555
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,540
他是什么反应
How did he react?

556
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,040
他很冷漠吧  我看不透他
He was cold, I guess. I couldn't really read him.

557
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,280
他看起来好虚弱
He looks so weak.

558
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,190
要我回华盛顿吗
Should I come back to Washington?

559
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,710
看看接下来几天的情况吧
Let's see how the next couple of days go.

560
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,620
随时通知我  我立马上飞机
Well, just say the word, I'm on a plane.

561
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,310
好吧  谢谢  莉安  晚安
All right, thank you, LeAnn. Good night.

562
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,490
晚安
Good night.

563
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,090
弗兰西斯  能听到吗
Francis, can you hear me?

564
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,650
弗兰西斯
Francis.

565
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,570
我刚跟艾迪的父母通了话  夫人
I just spoke to Eddie's parents, ma'am.

566
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,530
您说您想给他们打电话
You said you wanted to call them?

567
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,600
是的  谢谢
Yes, thank you.

568
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,150
艾德华不止是位英雄  密查姆太太
Edward was more than a hero, Mrs. Meechum.

569
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,430
他是我们的朋友
He was our friend.

570
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,510
我非常遗憾您失去了儿子
I'm so sorry for your loss.

571
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,470
如果有什么我能为您
Please, let me know if there's anything

572
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,820
和您的家人做的  务必告诉我
I can do for you and your family.

573
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,390
您随时可以给我打电话
You can call me anytime.

574
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
是的  太太  这是我的私人号码
Yes, ma'am, that is my private number.

575
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,260
我再次深表遗憾
And again, I'm so sorry.

576
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,430
-卢卡斯·古德温  -我们不知道他出狱了
- Lucas Goodwin? - We didn't know he was out.

577
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,670
怎么可能  他被释放了你却不知道
How can that happen? He's released and you didn't know--

578
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,000
夫人  说到威胁
Ma'am... as far as threats go,

579
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,200
我们最近几乎都在忙着应付您
we've been far more occupied with you lately.

580
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,730
我希望我们能合作  因为我需要您的帮助
I'm hoping that we can work together, because I need your help.

581
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,910
-怎么帮  -副总统
- How? - The vice president.

582
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,750
我们谈过了  我告诉他我会陪他出面
We spoke. I told him I would appear with him.

583
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,090
不是声明的事
Not the statement.

584
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,780
他现在有个决定难以定夺
He's having trouble making a decision.

585
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,340
您能跟我一起回白宫吗
Can you come back to the White House with me?

586
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,110
这事很严重  夫人
It's serious, ma'am.

587
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,140
我可以在路上跟您说明情况
I can fill you in on the way.

588
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,510
我去拿我的东西
I'll grab my things.

589
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,590
我不能让你进去  先生
I can't let you go any farther, sir.

590
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,210
我是他的幕僚长
I'm his Chief of Staff.

591
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,620
抱歉  先生 
I'm sorry, sir.

592
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,060
现在只有医生和第一夫人可以进去
Only doctors and the First Lady for now.

593
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,480
克莱尔
Claire.

594
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,810
你好
Hello.

595
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,110
你好吗
How are you?

596
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,980
-累坏了  -肯定的
- Exhausted. - I'm sure.

597
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,310
你一定也累坏了
You must be, too.

598
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,770
有太多东西我不了解  快把我...搞晕了
There's so much I don't know. It's... overwhelming.

599
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,050
先生  我已向第一夫人说明了米尔金行动
Sir, I briefed the First Lady on the Milkin operation.

600
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,340
考虑到她曾与俄罗斯有过直接交涉
I thought she might have some insight,

601
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,630
我想也许她会有一些见解
given her experience working directly with Russia.

602
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,520
我知道已经有很多人为你出谋划策了
I know you've had a lot of people weigh in already.

603
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,740
我重视你的建议  克莱尔  我很高兴你能来
I value your input, Claire. I'm glad you're here.

604
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,410
-道格拉斯  能让我们单独谈谈吗  -当然
- Douglas, will you give us a minute? - Of course.

605
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,330
我会跟内阁在一起  先生
I'll be with the cabinet, sir.

606
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,130
你知道人们常说
You know that thing that people say,

607
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,360
上帝不会让你无法承受
"God never gives you more than you can handle"?

608
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,060
知道
Yes.

609
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,490
我的玛乔莉  愿主保佑她
My Marjory, God bless her,

610
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,050
她说那是屁话
she said that was pure bullshit.

611
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,050
你丈夫正在与死神搏斗
Oh, listen to me complaining

612
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,110
却还得听我抱怨
while your husband is fighting for his life.

613
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,890
没关系  其实我需要分散下注意
Oh, it's okay. Actually, I need the distraction.

614
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,090
我们谈谈俄罗斯吧
Let's talk Russia.

615
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:55,700
我很纠结  我们有架飞机在北海上空盘旋
I'm torn. Uh, we have this plane circling over the North Sea...

616
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,430
-我不知道该怎么做  -你的直觉是什么
- and I don't know what to do. - Well, what does your gut tell you?

617
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,430
我从来就不是靠直觉做事的人
I've never been a gut sort of guy.

618
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,410
如果有把枪指在我头上...
I mean, if I had a gun to my head...

619
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,330
-对不起  我比喻不当  -没关系  继续
- Sorry, that was a poor choice of words. - It's fine. Go on.

620
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,150
我理解总统希望达到的目的
I understand what the president hoped to achieve,

621
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,870
但一想到激怒俄罗斯...
but the thought of provoking Russia...

622
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,130
我这才刚开始了解此事的复杂性
And I'm just beginning to immerse myself in all the complexities.

623
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,990
如果换了弗兰克  他会怎么做呢
What would Frank do, if he were in my shoes right now?

624
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,980
如果他在这儿  他会告诉你
If he were here, he'd tell you

625
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,970
那是你最不应该考虑的事
that's the last thing you should think about,

626
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,030
因为他不在这儿  你在
because he's not here, you are.

627
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,830
你会怎么做
What would you do?

628
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,490
继续这项任务还是叫他回来
Proceed with the mission or bring him back?

629
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,030
两者我都不喜欢
I don't like either.

630
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,570
我只有这两个选择
Those are my options.

631
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,950
如果说在弗兰西斯身边28年  我学到了什么
Well, if there's one thing I've learned, 28 years with Francis,

632
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,790
那就是他重复多次的那句话
and he said it time and time again,

633
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,200
"如果你不喜欢餐具的摆放..."
"If you don't like the way the table is set..."

634
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,010
-"那就掀桌子"  -没错
- "Then turn over the table." - That's right.

635
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,800
他跟我说过不止一次
He's said it to me, more than once.

636
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,020
那你就该这么做  唐纳德
Then that's what you should do, Donald.

637
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,090
-但要怎么做呢  -我们一起想想吧
- But how? - Well, let's figure it out.

638
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,780
我们不是早该降落了吗
Weren't we supposed to have landed already?

639
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,010
我们在待命航线上
We're in a holding pattern.

640
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,270
为什么  出什么事了吗
Why? Is something wrong?

641
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,790
我只知道我们在待命航线上
All I know is we're in a holding pattern.

642
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,900
道格
Doug.

643
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,730
这架飞机很快就会没油
This plane's gonna run out of fuel soon.

644
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,460
我们一定要找个地方让它降落
We're gonna have to put it down somewhere.

645
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,130
我马上就发表声明  先跟记者团打声招呼吧
I'll be making a statement shortly. Let's notify the press corps.

646
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,930
-关于行动吗  -不  让美国人民放心
- About the operation? - No, to reassure the American people.

647
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,180
-我在那边等你吗  -给我十分钟
- Shall I meet you in there? - Ten minutes.

648
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,080
内阁呢
The cabinet?

649
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,420
-还在等您的决定  先生  -很好
- Still waiting on your decision, sir. - Good.

650
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,780
走吧
Let's go.

651
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,180
把飞机降落在中国
I want you to land the plane in China.

652
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,190
中国吗  先生
China, sir?

653
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,200
没有中国的钱就没有救市计划
There's no bailout without Chinese money.

654
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,660
我们把米尔金给他们  他们会有更多筹码
We give them Milkin, they have more leverage.

655
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,230
先生  那我们就没有筹码了
Sir, that gives away our leverage.

656
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,850
我不赞成政权更迭  但那是...
I'm not for regime change, but that just...

657
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,080
这是佩特罗夫最想不到的事
It's the last thing that Petrov is expecting.

658
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,160
他们会索要东西伯利亚的钻井权
They'll demand drilling access in eastern Siberia.

659
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,870
等他们提出  我们就是两害中较轻的那个
And when they do, we become the lesser of two evils.

660
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,720
先生  总统从未打算
Sir, at no time did the president

661
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,460
把中国搅进来...
intend on bringing China into the mix...

662
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,130
让飞机降落在中国领土上
Get the plane on Chinese soil.

663
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,760
并且移交米尔金的资产  这就是我的决定
And turn over Milkin's assets. That's my decision.

664
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,820
-我是向你求助的  -我也给予了帮助
- I asked for your help. - And that's what I gave.

665
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,760
不  中国不在总统的计划范围内
No, China wasn't part of the president's plan.

666
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,910
它在代总统的计划范围内
It's part of the acting president's plan.

667
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,580
-你准备好了吗  -好了  就等你了
- You ready? - Yes, whenever you are.

668
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,040
-赛斯  -是  先生
- Seth? - Yes, sir.

669
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,330
女士们先生们  有请代总统
Ladies and gentlemen, the acting president.

670
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,100
请坐
Please, sit.

671
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,370
今天对所有美国民众来说都是艰难的一天
This is a difficult day for all Americans,

672
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,520
特别是对安德伍德夫人
particularly for Mrs. Underwood,

673
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,930
很感谢她能来到这儿
who is gracious enough to be here,

674
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,430
在我向焦虑的国民讲话时  给我力量
to lend me strength while I address an anxious nation.

675
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,160
总统先生
Mr. President!

677
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:12,580
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}美国历史上共有四名总统在任上遭暗杀
分别是亚伯拉罕·林肯  詹姆斯·加菲尔德
威廉·麦金利  约翰·肯尼迪
其中林肯和肯尼迪的遇刺最受关注
关于刺杀的动机  细节  甚至凶手身份
都有各种同官方说法不同的"阴谋论"
肯尼迪的遇刺争议最大
至今仍有大量美国民众认为
在达拉斯开枪击中肯尼迪的不止一名枪手

679
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:32,580
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}此外  美国历史上还发生过多起刺杀未遂事件
1981年3月30日  里根在离开华盛顿希尔顿酒店时
一个名为约翰·辛克力的男子近距离连发6枪
总统的一名贴身保镖蒂莫西·麦卡锡  挺身而出挡住了一颗子弹
但仍有一颗子弹打在总统专车上后反弹射入里根体内
击中了他的肺部
里根随即被送往乔治华盛顿大学医院接受手术
手术开始前  神智尚清醒的共和党人里根
同主刀医生开玩笑说  "希望你是一名共和党人"
医生回答说  "总统先生  今天我们都是共和党人"
经治疗  里根于4月25日重返白宫

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}枪手辛克力刺杀里根  并非出于政治原因
而是想通过这一举动
引起自己崇拜的好莱坞女星朱迪·福斯特的注意
被捕后  辛克力因"精神失常"而被判无罪
但一直被关在医疗机构接受治疗
白宫发言人布雷迪在刺杀中被击中头部而造成终身残疾
此后他同妻子一起致力于推动枪支管制
多年后他帮助通过了美国历史上最严格的枪支管制法案
挺身挡枪的保镖麦卡锡被射中腹部  经手术后完全康复
从白宫退休后  目前在伊利诺伊州担任警察局长
