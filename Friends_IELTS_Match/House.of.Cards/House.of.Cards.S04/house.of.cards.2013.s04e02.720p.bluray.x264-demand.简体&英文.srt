00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,370
他是个没有格调  没有风度  没有羞耻的蛮人
He is a classless, graceless, shameless barbarian.

13
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,110
他那么对你  伊丽莎白  简直恶心
What he did to you, Elizabeth, it was disgusting.

14
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,940
-可怕  -太过分了
- Awful. - Just vile.

15
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,140
-能递给我那盘...  -好
- Can you pass the plate of... - Yeah.

16
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,670
可你为什么没告诉我们
But why didn't you tell us?

17
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,830
一想到那么多年来  你一个人抵抗病魔
The thought of you fighting this alone, all those years...

18
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,360
我不希望人可怜
I didn't want pity.

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,340
他们真的吵架了吗
Is it true that they were arguing?

20
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,580
不  她是南下来陪我的
No, she came down here to be with me.

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,690
当然  我们没想到
Of course, we didn't expect

22
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,090
这事会被当众说出去
that it was gonna be made a public display.

23
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,420
他大概觉得那样最能打消传言吧
I guess he thought that was the best way to dispel the rumors.

24
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,940
那人不配当总统
That man does not deserve to be president.

25
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,650
我一向不愿说他坏话  伊丽莎白
I've never wanted to speak ill of him, Elizabeth,

26
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,550
但我一想到他是怎么对待你和克莱尔的
but when I think of the way he's treated you and Claire...

27
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,130
行了  他还是她的女婿呢
Oh, stop now. He is still her son-in-law.

28
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,220
不  芭说得对
No, Bar's right.

29
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,840
他不配当总统
He doesn't deserve to be president.

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,110
你们...其实都可以帮我
You could... all help me, actually.

31
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,110
-什么都行  -随你说
- Anything. - Just say the word.

32
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,260
希瑟·邓巴
Heather Dunbar.

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,090
我们该支持她
We should be supporting her.

34
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,590
用我们的支票支持
With our checkbooks.

35
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,850
你真心希望他输吗
You really want him to lose?

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,450
等他输了  克莱尔就能开启自己的事业了
When he loses, Claire can begin her own career...

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,690
这对我来说更加重要
which is far more important to me.

38
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,330
我不知道我们是不是能起到作用  但是
I don't know if we can really make a difference, but...

39
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,550
我想做点比坐在这儿说他坏话更实际的事
I'd rather do more than just sit around and bad-mouth him.

40
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,840
那么  我们就写张支票吗
So, we just write a check?

41
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
不能让弗兰西斯知道
Now, Francis can't know.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,580
我们的捐助得...曲线救国
I mean, our donations will have to be... once removed.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,910
那项修正案已经拖延多年了
That amendment has stalled for years.

44
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,660
因为我们在退休军人事务处没人
Because we didn't have someone in Veterans Affairs.

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,920
这不是退休军人问题  是公共卫生问题
It isn't a veterans issue. It's public health.

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,250
这不是我的强项
That's not my specialty.

47
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,420
等等  你是说
Wait, you're telling me

48
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,470
你不认识任何得过乳腺癌的人吗
you don't know anyone who's had breast cancer?

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,890
我是指立法方面
I mean in terms of legislation.

50
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,500
多50%
Fifty percent more.

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,840
黑人女性患乳腺癌后
That's how many more black women

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,970
死亡率比白人女性高50%
die of breast cancer than white women.

53
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,640
在我们选区  比率高于谋杀率
In our district, it's higher than the murder rate.

54
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,490
帮我们拿下诊所
Help us get this clinic.

55
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,880
我并不否认这一问题的重要性
I don't deny that it's an important issue,

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,150
但我得选好自己支持什么
but I have to pick and choose what I support.

57
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,720
你在家乡的竞选选情严峻  议员女士
You're in a tight race back home, Congresswoman.

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,720
我们可以建立超级政治行动委员会
We'll set up a super PAC.

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,460
三百万美元
Three million dollars.

60
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,660
你没跟我谈就这么做了
You did this without talking to me?

61
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,640
克莱尔和我好好谈过了  母亲
Claire and I spoke at length, Mother.

62
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,780
克莱尔
Claire?

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,480
你对第一夫人都直呼其名了啊
You're calling the First Lady by her given name, now?

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,210
希望你也可以如此  议员女士
Well, and I would hope you would, too, Congresswoman.

65
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,390
你背着我行动  安德伍德夫人
You went behind my back, Mrs. Underwood.

66
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,980
我不是求你全力支持我
I'm not asking for a full endorsement.

67
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,670
我只是求你允许西莉娅延迟竞选
I'm just asking for your blessing on Celia delaying her run.

68
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,190
当然  也保证不会跟我竞争
And of course, a promise to not campaign against me.

69
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,490
杰姬·夏普很支持邓巴
Jackie Sharp's big on Dunbar.

70
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,870
她为什么要帮你
Why would she help you?

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,310
这笔钱跟我们不直接挂钩
This money isn't directly linked to us.

72
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,250
你是说总统乐意
You mean the president's comfortable

73
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,550
给杰姬送竞选经费吗
putting money in Jackie's war chest?

74
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,420
是的  但我们得保密
He is, but we have to keep this quiet.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,040
你们两个办公室之间绝对不能有联络
There can't be any communication between your office and his.

76
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,760
-讲话  -赛斯把最新的改动加进去了

77
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,720
等您批准了  我们就拿给提词器的人
Once you approve, we'll send it to the teleprompters.

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
-她到了吗  -几分钟前刚到
- Has she arrived yet? - A few minutes ago.

79
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,670
请坐
Please sit down.

80
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,900
如果杰姬退缩  我们不能给她留后路
If Jackie gets cold feet, we can't leave her any choice.

81
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,600
我已经在处理了
I'm already on top of that.

82
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,280
怎么处理
How?

我不是单纯的技术员  我也会老法子

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,110

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,350
真是气派
This is impressive.

89
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,460
趁现在好好瞻仰一下吧  我们一会儿就走
Well, soak it up while you can. We won't be here long.

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,500
我就回来
I'll be right back.

92
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,570

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,920
电视台和报社后一直公开抨击佩特罗夫
after the government seized his TV stations and newspapers.

99
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,150
两小时前  他的私人飞机在缅因州班格尔降落
His private plane landed in Bangor, Maine, two hours ago.

100
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,270
我们在停机坪上隔离了他

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,490
他寻求政治庇护  说担心自己有生命危险
He's seeking political asylum. Says he's in fear for his life.

102
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,960
我们认为他们一直在密谋推翻佩特罗夫
We believe they've been formulating a plan to unseat Petrov.

那就送他回去
Then send him back.

106
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,250
我不希望国情咨文被
I don't want the State of the Union

107
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,770
庇护纠纷盖过风头
overshadowed by some asylum dispute.

108
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,180
他是佩特罗夫的麻烦  不关我们的事
He's Petrov's problem, not ours.

109
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,980
从法律上讲  先生
Legally, sir,

110
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,910
我们有义务处理他的庇护请求
we are obligated to process his asylum request.

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,260
-媒体不是已经知道了吧  -不  先生
- Don't tell me the press knows he's here. - No, sir.

112
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,680
他们一进入美国领空
We jammed communications on his plane

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,320
我们就屏蔽了他飞机的通讯
as soon as it entered U.S. airspace.

114
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,630
那不就没有问题了吗
Then we don't have a problem, do we?

115
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,960
如果我们送他回去  他很可能会被杀
It's likely he'll be killed if we send him back.

116
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360

So be it. He tried to slay a dragon and he missed the mark.

117

现在他得面对怒火了
Now he's gotta face the fire.

118
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,210
我们担心会发生更多杀戮  更多公司被查抄
Our fear is more killings, more company seizures.

119
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,470
会导致银行挤兑
That leads to a run on the banks,

120
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,270
卢布崩溃  债务违约
collapse of the ruble, default on debts.

121
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,960
我们已经知道
And we already know

他一直在跟国际货币基金组织暗中联络
he's been back-channeling about a bailout

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,160
讨论救市计划
with the IMF.

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,310
你如果有提议  就快点说
Well, if you have a proposal to make, then make it quickly.

125
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,810
-我还得准备讲话呢  -是  先生
- I have a speech to prep for. - Yes, sir.

126
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,100
去年您穿的是灰褐色  或许这件太像了
Last year you wore the taupe, so maybe this is too similar?

127
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,920
请进
Come in.

128
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,900
我接通了黑尔太太的电话
I was able to get Mrs. Hale on the phone.

129
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,440
太好了  能让我们单独待会儿吗
Oh, great. Uh, could you excuse me for a moment?

130
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
-母亲  -您没事吧  黑尔太太
- Mother? - You doing okay, Mrs. Hale?

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,180
是的  谢谢
Yes, thank you.

132
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,880
那是谁
Who was that?

133
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,180
我奖励自己做美甲呢
I'm treating myself to a pedicure.

134
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,940
没人能听到我
Nobody can hear me.

135
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,180
你想谈谈吗
You wanted to talk?

136
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,100
是的  我想感谢你  感谢你的帮助
Yes, I wanted to thank you, for all of your help.

137
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,920
看来议员女士倾向于同意了
Uh, it looks like the congresswoman is leaning toward a yes.

138
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,110
我在想  等你竞选时
You know, I was thinking, when you run,

139
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,630
你该用你的娘家姓
you should use your maiden name instead.

140
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,140
母亲  我不能那么做  面子上过不去
Mother, I couldn't do that. It would look bad.

141
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,330
那可不可以...
Well, then how about if you...

142
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,970
叫克莱尔·黑尔-安德伍德
if you use Claire Hale-Underwood?

143
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,080
这听上去挺不错的
That has a nice ring to it.

144
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,040
或许吧
Maybe.

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,320
-你见他了吗  -还没
- Have you seen him yet? - No, not yet.

146
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,300
你今晚打算穿什么
What are you gonna wear tonight?

147
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,460
其实我正在考虑呢
I was just deciding that now, actually.

148
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,490
希望是件深色的
Something dark, I hope.

149
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,700
要么是黑色  要么是象牙白  老实说
Well, it's between black and ivory, and to tell you the truth,

150
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,410
象牙白这件美极了
this ivory is so beautiful--

151
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,800
老天爷  别穿象牙白
Oh, for God's sakes, don't wear ivory.

152
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,120
就算是你那样的身材
Even with your figure,

153
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,920
也只会突出各种不该突出的地方
it'll accentuate all the wrong places.

154
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,560
你会看讲话吗
Are you going to watch the speech?

155
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,210
母亲
Mother?

156
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,950
嗯  我...
Yes, I'm gonna...

157
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,250
我会让迈克尔在卧室里摆台电视
I'm gonna have Michael put a TV in the bedroom.

158
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,550
安德伍德夫人  总统在等您了
Mrs. Underwood, the president is ready for you.

159
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,850
我就出去
I'll be right out.

160
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,600
母亲  我得挂了
Mother, I have to go.

161
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,930
嗯  当然  你肯定很忙
Yes, I-- Of course. I'm sure you must be very busy.

162
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,530
回家见
I'll see you when I get home?

163
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,090
如果我睡了
If I'm asleep...

164
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,540
那我们早上见
Then I'll see you in the morning.

165
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,810
再见  母亲
Goodbye, Mother.

166
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,160
再见  穿黑的那件
Bye. Wear the black!

167
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,420
这事绝不能泄露出去
I don't want even the slightest chance this gets out.

168
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,620
我们设了警戒线  机尾号也会遮住
We set up a perimeter. And we'll cover the tail number.

169
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,300
很好  跟佩特罗夫约好讲话后通话
Good. Set up a call with Petrov, for after the speech.

170
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,840
那时莫斯科是凌晨五点
It'll be 5:00 a.m. in Moscow.

171
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,520
他肯定会看的
Oh, I guarantee he'll be watching.

172
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,640
先生  您得接一下
Sir? I think you should take this.

173
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,800
失陪
Excuse me.

174
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,200
你好  议员女士
Hello, Congresswoman.

175
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,990
抱歉来晚了  请坐
Sorry for the delay. Please sit down.

176
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,320
你收到耳环了吗
Did you get the earrings?

177
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,890
是的  谢谢
I did. Thank you.

178
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,740
我母亲的  两克拉钻石
My mother's. Two-carat diamonds.

179
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
今晚戴吧
For tonight.

180
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,450
没什么比得上钻石耳环了
There's nothing quite like diamond earrings.

181
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,400
我们开始吧
Shall we begin?

182
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,740
今年  我们要改变一下出场方式
Uh, this year, we're handling the arrival a bit differently.

您将先被护送去圆形大厅与领导层合影
You'll be escorted to the rotunda for a photo op with the leadership

184
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,040
然后再去等候室
before going to the holding room.

185
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,390
我不需要去等候室
I don't need to go to the holding room.

186
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,390
你直接带我去大厅吧
You can take me directly to the gallery.

187
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,990
没关系  都听第一夫人的
Yes, that's fine. Whatever the First Lady prefers.

188
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,040
之后我们需要分两个车队
And we'll need two separate motorcades after.

189
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,280
我要直接去机场
I'll be going straight to the airport.

190
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,570
-那就两个车队  -是  先生

192
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,070
看上去没什么问题
This all seems pretty straightforward.

193
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,010
如果你觉得没问题我也没问题
I'm good if you are.

194
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,380
嗯  没问题  多谢你了
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you so very much.

195
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,620
你有空吗
Do you have a moment?

196
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,040
伊丽莎白怎么样了
How's Elizabeth?

197
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,070
她让我代她问好
She sends her regards.

198
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,650
当然了
I'll bet she does.

199
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,870
竞选呢
And the campaign?

200
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,360
还在试探
Still exploring viability.

201
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,250
桃瑞丝还没答应吗
Doris isn't on board yet?

202
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,350
回头就知道了
Uh, we'll see.

203
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,380
你给了她什么
What have you offered her?

204
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,500
我想先跟莉安策划一个稳妥的竞选策略
Well, I want to put together a solid campaign strategy with LeAnn

205
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,850
再跟她二次接触
before engaging her again.

206
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,660
如果你需要我帮忙  就告诉我
Well, if you need my help, let me know.

207
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,720
我当党鞭时  我们关系很好
She and I were very close when I was whip.

208
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,700
-你的事够多了  -不麻烦的
- You've got a lot on your plate. - No, it's no trouble at all.

我要做些改动
I need to make some changes.

213

我去叫讲稿撰写人
I'll call the speech writers.

214
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,670
不用  我自己来  去把克丽丝塔找来
No, I wanna do these myself. And track down Calista.

215
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,500
我们还得再加一名宾客
We have to make room for one more guest.

216
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,450
是  先生
Yes, sir.

217
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,020
怎么回事
What's that?

218
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,570
我要把文身洗掉
I'm having it removed.

219
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,980
太可惜了  我挺喜欢呢
Well, that's too bad. I liked it.

220
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,510
该向前看了
Hmm, time to move on.

221
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,920
你想放下什么
From what?

222
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,690
需要文身的我
From the me that needed a tattoo.

223

我没多少时间
I don't have much time.

224
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,010
你什么时候得去国会大厦
When do you have to be at the Capitol?

225
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,830

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,950
见过她几次  不怎么了解
Oh, uh, met her a few times. I don't know her that well, though.

229
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,390
-怎么  -她女儿  西莉娅

筹建一家乳腺癌诊所

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,790
作为回报  他们愿用德州的钱资助我的竞选

To start.

她的选区才没那么多钱
Her district doesn't have that kind of money.

西莉娅说他们的捐助人是30区以外的

237
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,330

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,220
我们请不起她
We couldn't afford her.

244
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,830
我知道你已经金盆洗手了  但这笔钱不是小数
Look, I know you're out of the game, but this is a lot of money.

如果是真  能帮我大忙  如果不是...
If it's legit, it could really help me. But if it's not, I--

I'll talk to LeAnn and see what I can find out.

我不舒服

那您就更该吃点晚饭了  您的药

258

别让我再说一遍了  迈克尔

拿走  这味儿熏得我难受

It's more fun this way. You know, hanging with the hoi polloi.

267
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,380
你为什么来华府
So, what brings you to D.C.?

268
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,590
国会都到齐了  适合揽活儿干
Well, all of Congress in town, it's good for hustling work.

269
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,430
你什么时候揽过活儿  你从来都是拒绝别人
Since when do you hustle? You turn people away.

270
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,320
你怎么知道我在这儿
How'd you know I was in town?

271

我虽然退休了  但还是眼观六路耳听八方
I might be retired, but I still have my ear to the ground.

当时我国处于完全不同的一个时期

我国正在从一起政治丑闻和

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,160
而你们面前的  是一位未经过选举的总统

290
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,450
但现在  那个人依然站在你们面前
But that same man stands before you now,

291
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,410
而黑暗时期已经过去
and the darkness is behind us.

292
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,010
国家现在情势大好  前途愈发光明
The state of the union is bright, and getting brighter.

293
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,810
我们遭遇过挑战  没错
We've had our challenges, yes.

294
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,640
尤其是跟俄罗斯
Particularly with Russia.

295
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,430
的确有些很紧张的时刻
There were some tense moments, to be sure,

296
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,270
但我们还是克服了那些紧张
and yet we overcame those tensions.

297
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,620
佩特罗夫总统让我们继续建立信任
President Petrov let us continue to build trust

298
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,330
并表现出我们已从去年的经历中吸取了教训
and show that we've learned from our experiences last year.

299
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,370
我个人想感谢第一夫人
And I'd personally like to acknowledge the First Lady,

300
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,400
她为修复两国关系带了路
who led the way in repairing those burned bridges.

301
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,990
她得到的掌声比总统还多
She's getting more applause than the president.

302
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,080
对你是好事吧
Good for you, isn't it?

303
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,560
好厉害的客户
Quite a high-profile client.

304
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,230
谁告诉你的
Who told you that?

305
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,600
只是一猜
Just a guess.

306
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,740
不  你猜错了
No, you guessed wrong.

307
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,140
你知道有财大气粗的德州捐助人
So what do you know about big Texas donors...

308
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,510
就为了达拉斯一个穷选区
who care enough about a poor Dallas district

309
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,350
会给加州的竞选捐钱吗
to donate money to a campaign in California?

310
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,280
我没听说过
That went right over my head.

311
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,410
第一夫人去了达拉斯  你当时也在那儿
First Lady was in Dallas. You were in Dallas.

312
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,640
第一夫人来了这儿
The First Lady is here.

313
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,800
你也来了
Now you're here.

314
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,590
我觉得你是太闲了  雷米
I think you have far too much time on your hands, Remy.

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,230
这笔钱上到处是你的痕迹
Your fingerprints are all over this money.

316
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,530
你现在为杰姬·夏普工作了
You're working for Jackie Sharp now?

317
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,330
不  只是朋友
No. Just friends.

318
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,920
-只是朋友吗  -嗯
- Just friends, huh? - Yeah.

319
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,900
我觉得她身上也到处是你的痕迹
I think your fingerprints are all over her.

320
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,280
这样如何
How about this?

321
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,120
你别来刺探我的事
You don't poke around in my shit...

322
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,760
我就不去刺探你的
and I won't poke around in yours.

323
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,920
见到你很高兴  雷米  别退休就变怂了
It was good to see you, Remy. Don't get too soft in retirement.

324
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,020
一般来说
Now, it's considered uncouth

325
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,390
正在进行竞选的总统
for a president who's in the midst of a campaign,

326
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,990
不该直接谈论即将到来的竞选  但今晚
to talk directly about the upcoming election, but tonight,

327
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,310
我觉得我必须谈
I feel compelled.

328
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,020
因为我们选民即将在
Because the votes our electorate casts

329
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,780
目前的初选和11月的大选中投的票
during the current primaries and the general election in November

330
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,270
将对在座的各位有深远的影响
will have a profound impact on everyone in this room.

331
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,490
有些人  包括我  可能将失业
Some of us, myself included, may find ourselves out of a job.

332
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,910
如果我们想保住工作
If we want to keep our jobs,

333
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,310
我们就得聆听美国民众的声音
we have to listen to the American people.

334
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,480
我们就得更加努力  说到做到
We have to work harder! We have to deliver!

335
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,350
就像桃瑞丝·琼斯
Just like Doris Jones.

336
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,640
她已经在国会任职了34年
She has kept her job in Congress for 34 years

337
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,740
因为她从未向逆境低过头
because she never relented in the face of adversity.

338
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,910
事实上  就在今天  她还为一家她已经争取了
In fact, just today, she called me about a breast cancer clinic

339
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,250
十年的乳腺癌诊所给我打了电话
she has been fighting for over the past decade.

340
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,930
她的计划很大胆
Now, her plan is bold.

341
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,520
将退伍军人医院扩张  向普通民众开放
A VA hospital expansion open to the general public,

342
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
由联邦资金资助
financed by federal money.

343
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,140
这一大胆计划能通过科普  筛查
A bold plan that will significantly increase successful diagnoses

344
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,600
和可负担医保  大幅提升确诊和治疗的成功率
and treatment through education, screenings, and affordable care.

345
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,260
她一次次遭遇阻力
Now, she's gotten resistance, time and again...

346
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,510
来自退伍军人事务处的阻力
from the Veterans Affairs administration,

347
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,610
来自她国会同事的阻力
from her colleagues in Congress...

348
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,780
-能调大声点吗  -来自那些不希望
- Can you turn it up a bit? - ...from those who don't want to see

349
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,150
政府给计划生育组织拨款的人
government funds going to Planned Parenthood.

350
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,770
但是  她今天打给我时
And yet, when she called me today,

351
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,980
她对建立这家诊所的热忱
she was just as passionate about this clinic

352
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,320
一如十年前她第一次跟我提出时那般
as she was when she first brought it up to me ten years ago.

353
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,170
桃瑞丝  你成功了
Well, Doris, it worked.

354
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,910
我会跟退伍军人事务部长
I'll be working with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,

355
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,820
住房和城市发展部以及国会领袖合作帮你建立诊所
HUD and the congressional leaders to get you that clinic.

356
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,850
因为你  我们将拯救生命
Because of you, we'll save lives.

357
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,230
这正是美国人民想看到的领导
And that is exactly the sort of leadership the American people want.

358
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,510
更多桃瑞丝·琼斯这样的领导人
More leaders like Doris Jones.

359
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,300
等她本届任期结束退休时
And when she retires at the end of this term,

360
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,260
我很高兴她女儿西莉娅
I'm delighted to say that her daughter, Celia,

361
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,130
将竞选缺职
will run for the open seat

362
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,500
像她母亲那样  继续实现人民的愿望
to continue delivering just like her mother has.

363
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,630
不会吧
No fucking way.

364
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,960
我本人会
And I, for one, will support

365
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,220
百分百支持你的竞选
your candidacy with everything I've got.

366
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,500
我知道克莱尔也会的
And I know Claire will, as well.

367
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,860
德州人百折不挠
Texans are tenacious.

368
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,640
我很骄傲我娶了一位
I'm proud to be married to one,

369
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,600
我很骄傲曾与琼斯议员女士
and I'm proud to have served with one,

370
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,050
这样的德州人共事过
like Congresswoman Jones.

371
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,880
谢谢你  桃瑞丝  谢谢你多年的服务
Thank you, Doris, for all your years of service,

372
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,060
也谢谢你  西莉娅  继承母亲的衣钵
and thank you, Celia, for picking up the mantle.

373
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,330
桃瑞丝说是她女儿说话冒失
Doris said her daughter spoke out of turn,

374
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,680
她对她和安德伍德协商的交易并不知情
that she didn't know about the deal she was brokering with Underwood.

375
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,380
你跟莉安联络上了吗
Did you connect with LeAnn?

376
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,630
没有
No, I didn't.

377
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,890
她说她得明天才能见我
She said she couldn't meet until tomorrow.

378
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,810
现在也没必要了
Well, I guess there's no point now, anyway.

379
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,600
如果是白宫在准备筹款
If the White House is orchestrating the funding,

380
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,470
安德伍德肯定不需要我帮忙
Underwood's not gonna want my help.

381
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,400
该死  那笔钱本来能帮大忙的
Fuck! I really could've used that money.

382
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,950
如果看上去像天上掉馅饼
Well, when it looks too good to be true...

383
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,080
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

384
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,000
我什么时候能再见你
When am I gonna see you again?

385
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
我不知道
I don't know.

386
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,640
我有点...闷得发疯
I've been... feeling a bit stir-crazy.

387
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,150
如果我退休了  或许该出去走走
If I'm retired, I should probably travel some.

388
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,290
你可以去加州啊
Well, you could travel to California.

389
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,190
11月之前  我会更多待在那边
I'll be there more than here until November.

390
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,850
或许吧
Yeah, maybe.

391
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,820
不去也行
Or don't.

392
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,240
你知道怎么联系我
You know how to reach me.

393
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,340
你觉得是雷米吗
Do you think it was Remy?

394
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,900
不太可能  我让他知道我们知道了
Highly doubtful. I made it clear what we knew.

395
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,320
他知道你有证据吗
He knows you have proof?

396
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,710
他知道我知道  不知道我有证据
He knows that I know. Not that I have proof.

397
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,150
或许我们不该这就把那张牌打出去
Maybe we shouldn't have played that card yet.

398
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,040
雷米把事情都串起来了
Remy was connecting the dots.

399
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,960
我必须让他打住
I needed to put the brakes on him.

400
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,980
如果不是他
Well, if it wasn't him,

401
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,050
那肯定是桃瑞丝自己去找了弗兰西斯
Doris must've gone to Francis himself.

402
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,210
她看到了机会就...
She saw an opening and--

403
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,290
女士  计划有变
Ma'am, there's been a change of plans.

404
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,550
等等  什么计划有变
Uh, hold on. What change of plans?

405
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,610
我们带您回白宫
We're taking you back to the White House.

406
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,420
不  我们得去安德鲁斯空军基地
No, we're going to Andrews.

407
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,940
抱歉  这是总统的直接命令
I'm sorry, this is direct from the president.

408
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,840
这不会像看上去那么困难
This is not gonna be as difficult as it seems.

409
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,520
泰瑞明天一早就跟退伍军人事务处
Now, Terry's gonna be in touch with Veteran Affairs

410
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,590
那边接触  起草修正案
first thing tomorrow to draft an amendment.

411
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,550
如果共和党在委员会那里给我们阻力
And if the Republicans give us any resistance in committee,

412
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,990
我就开始打电话找人
I'll start making calls.

413
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,410
本轮会议结束之前
No reason why this can't get to the floor

414
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,890
完全可以呈递国会
before the end of the session.

415
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,150
谢谢你  总统先生
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

416
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,940
谢你自己  你这手玩得漂亮
Thank yourself. You played this well.

417
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,130
你怎么玩的
How did you play it?

418
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,570
那是我们的小秘密了
Well, now, that's our little secret, isn't it?

419
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,500
我送你出去
I'll walk you out.

420
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,130
总统先生  我来吧
Uh, Mr. President, I got this.

421
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,910
克莱尔
Oh, Claire.

422
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,220
总统的讲话多棒啊
Didn't the president make the most wonderful speech?

423
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,290
是啊
Oh, he certainly did.

424
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,440
多谢你说服总统
And I thank you for convincing the president

425
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,300
在讲话中提到西莉娅
to mention Celia in his remarks.

426
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,940
不客气
Well, it was my pleasure.

427
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,860
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

428
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
晚安  克莱尔
Good night, Claire.

429
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,260
我们说好的
We had a deal.

430
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,780
我来了
I showed up.

431
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,820
却利用这个机会给我的竞选拆台
And used that opportunity to undermine the campaign.

432
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,290
你为什么不问我
Why didn't you just ask me?

433
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,430
如果你需要用诊所打动桃瑞丝
If you needed the clinic to convince Doris--

434
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,380
你根本不希望我竞选  弗兰西斯
You don't want me to run, Francis.

435
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,460
是的  我不希望  但我们已经达成谅解了
That's right, I don't. But we'd reached an understanding.

436
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,860
我觉得你就是说了些讨好我的话
I think you said what you wanted me to hear.

437
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,720
那你误解我了
Well, then you misread me.

438
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,340
我是在替自己着想  你也一样
I am looking out for myself. Just like you are.

439
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,440
你为自己着想
And where did that get you,

440
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,420
而不是为我们两人着想的下场又如何
looking out for yourself instead of looking out for us?

441
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,120
30选区现在没希望了  你明白的
The 30th is dead now. You know that.

442
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,520
你觉得我会放弃吗
You think I'm giving up?

443
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,350
怎么  你要跟琼斯母女竞争吗
What, you're gonna run against the Joneses?

444
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,070
你会出丑的  克莱尔
You'll make a fool of yourself, Claire.

445
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,840
即便他们支持你  你的胜算都不大
The odds were against you even with their blessing.

446
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,210
我本希望你自己能明白
Now, I hoped you'd reach that conclusion on your own.

447
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,270
但你却对我撒谎
But instead, you lied to me.

448
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,760
我没法逼你想通道理
Now, I can't force you to see reason.

449
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,530
但我不允许你成为隐患
But I will not allow you to become dangerous.

450
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,650
我也来一杯
I'll take one.

451
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,980
喝我的吧
Take mine.

452
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,160
克莱尔  听我说
Claire, look...

453
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,210
我赢下大选后  我们就可以专注于
When I win the general, then we can concentrate

454
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,060
为你在德州赢得参议员席位
on a Senate seat for you in Texas.

455
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,550
你反正也不会想待在众议院
You don't want to be in the House, anyway.

456
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,550
我们两人都没想到会出现希瑟·邓巴
And neither of us could have predicted a Heather Dunbar,

457
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,470
那么厉害的对手
or how formidable she'd be.

458
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,090
我们现在是在搏命
We are fighting for our lives here.

459
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,080
等你竞选  你会希望处于有利地位
And when you run, you wanna do so from a position of strength.

460
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,310
这是个时机问题
It's about timing.

461
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,390
或许是太早了  或许你是对的
Maybe it's too soon. Maybe you're right.

462
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,730
但我得想想
But I need to think.

463
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,280
好吧
Fair enough.

464
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,750
我不能在这儿想
I can't do that here.

465
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,160
回德州吗
Back in Texas?

466
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,480
我不确定我得想多久
I'm not sure how long I'll need.

467
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,220
需要多久都行
Well, take as long as you want.

468
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,910
我该走了
I should get going.

469
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,240
已经挺晚了  你确定你不想留下过夜吗
It's late. You sure you don't want to spend the night?

470
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,710
-母亲还在等我回去  -好吧
- Well, Mother was expecting me. - All right.

471
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,330
我自己出去  你继续喝吧
I'll walk myself out. You enjoy your drink.

472
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,850
以前有个男孩
You know, there was a boy

473
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,800
就住在我加夫尼老家一个街区外的地方
that lived down the street from me in Gaffney.

474
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,460
跟我年纪差不多  他叫沃特·莱森
About my age. His name was Walter Wryson.

475
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,410
他以前经常从家里跑出来  来我们家
He used to run away from home all the time and come to our house.

476
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,930
并没什么充分的缘由
Not for any good reason.

477
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,880
他爸爸不打他  也不愁吃穿
His daddy didn't beat him. He had clothes on his back.

478
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,670
莱森一家比我们有钱多了
The Wrysons had way more money than we did,

479
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,920
但他还是要逃家
but run away he would,

480
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,170
每个月至少一次  直接跑来我们家
at least once a month and come straight to our place.

481
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,400
一般  我母亲会打给他母亲
Now, usually, my mother would call his mother

482
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,110
然后她就会来接他
and she'd come and fetch him.

483
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,010
但到了第九第十次时
But about the ninth or tenth time this happened,

484
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,870
沃特跑到外面  爬上了我们后院的一棵树
Walter ran outside, climbed up into a tree in our backyard,

485
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,690
无论如何不肯下来
and wouldn't come down for nothing.

486
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,310
我妈妈跟他妈妈说
Now, my mama said to his mama,

487
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,870
"你让他在我们这儿待会儿吧
"Why don't you let us keep him for a while,

488
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,840
直到他肯回家了"
until he feels like coming home?"

489
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,110
但是  那小子可真是倔
But man, oh, man, that boy was stubborn.

490
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,440
到了晚上  他还在树上
Night came, and he was still up there.

491
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,400
不吃不喝  不拉屎
No food, no water... no toilet.

492
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,210
我去睡觉之前
And just before I went to bed,

493
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,620
我往窗外看  听到了他的哭声
I looked out my window and I heard him crying.

494
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,460
我说  "沃特  你为什么不下来呢"
And I said, "Walter, why don't you come on down?"

495
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,830
他就摇头  不肯
And he just shook his head no.

496
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,450
第二天早晨  我醒来  往窗外一看
Well, the next morning, I woke up, I looked out the window

497
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,560
沃特还在树上
and Walter was still up in that tree.

498
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,000
于是早饭之后  我拿着一盘鸡蛋过去
So after breakfast, I walked over with a plate of eggs...

499
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,040
问他是否想来点
and I asked him if he wanted some.

500
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,150
他又摇头
And again, he just shook his head.

501
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,780
我生气了
And I got angry.

502
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,310
那小子有个好房子  好家庭
That boy had a good house, a good family,

503
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,850
我求之不得的那种
the sort I would've killed for,

504
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,420
他自己却不自知
and he didn't even realize it.

505
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,290
于是我去工具棚  拿来把斧子
So I went into the tool shed and I took out an ax.

506
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,110
我对沃特说
And I said to Walter...

507
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,990
"你想知道住在我家究竟是什么感觉吗"
"You want to know what it's really like to live at my house?"

508
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,940
我一顿狂砍那棵树
And I gave that tree a good whack.

509
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,030
沃特大喊  但我没停手
And Walter cried out, but I kept on.

510
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,770
你从没听过
I mean, you've never heard

511
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,860
我砍树时  沃特发出的
screams like the one coming from Walter

512
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,970
那样的尖叫
as I chopped at that tree.

513
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,490
他都尿裤子了
He pissed his pants,

514
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,250
淋了下来
and it came raining down on the ground,

515
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,110
但我毫不在乎
but I didn't pay it no mind.

516
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,470
我还继续砍
I just kept whacking away.

517
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,950
于是
Well...

518
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,850
没过多久沃特就下来了
it didn't take long before Walter was on the ground

519
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,470
跑回了自己家
and running back to his house.

520
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,270
瞧  他不过就是需要点动力
You see, all he needed was a little motivation.

521
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,060
所以我可以给克莱尔时间
So I'll give Claire some time.

522
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,430
但为了她好
But for her sake,

523
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,820
希望她能在我拿出斧子之前
I hope she comes out of her tree

524
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,000
就从她的树上下来
before I have to bring out my ax.

525
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,670
他要我等着竞选参议员
He wants me to hold off for Senate.

526
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,070
我告诉他我会考虑的
I told him I would think about it.

527
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,410
-那么结束了吗  -不  没结束
- So it's over? - Oh, no, it's not over.

528
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,960
他在全国电视上表示支持西莉娅
He endorsed Celia on national television.

529
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,410
别去想30选区了
Forget the 30th.

530
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,940
我们得往大想  就在本轮
We need to think bigger. This cycle.

531
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,730
那我们得好好谈谈我的酬金问题了
Then we need to talk seriously about my compensation.

532
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,800
-接通了吗  -是  先生
- He on? - Yes, sir.

533
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,320
我准备好了
I'm ready.

534
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,890
我这就给您接  先生
I'll connect you now, sir.

535
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,380
佩特罗夫总统  您现在在跟总统通话了
President Petrov, you are now on with the president.

536
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,950
晚上好  总统先生
Good evening, Mr. President.

537
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,390
早上好  总统先生
Good morning, Mr. President.

538
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,780
你的讲话很棒
Your speech was good.

539
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,480
或许有点太...
Perhaps, a bit too...

540
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,340
乐观了
optimistic, hmm?

541
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,230
我说的关于俄罗斯的话都是真心的
I meant what I said about Russia.

542
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,930
那只是空谈  没多大意义
It's just words. They mean very little.

543
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,110
我愿意用实际行动支持我的言论
I'm willing to back them up with action.

544
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,600
首先  我们该谈谈救市计划
First, we should talk about a bailout.

545
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,300
我愿意跟国际货币基金组织合作  帮你拿到所需
I'm willing to work with the IMF to get you what you need.

546
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,810
其次  作为示好
And second, as a gesture of good faith,

547
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,370
我们愿把伊戈尔·米尔金还给俄罗斯
we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.

548
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,920
你早该送他回来了
You should've done so already.

549
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,370
我需要你保证他会得到审判
I need your assurances he'll get a trial.

550
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,970
-你在乎伊戈尔·米尔金干吗  -我不在乎
- What do you care about Igor Milkin? - I don't.

551
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,120
你就是把他送去西伯利亚
You can send him to Siberia

552
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,300
让他在矿井里死于黑肺病  我都不在乎
and let him die of black lung in a coal mine, for all I care.

553
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,250
但我在乎你的经济
But I do care about your economy.

554
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,190
你继续这么杀害受瞩目的商人
You keep killing high-profile businessmen

555
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,300
查抄他们的财产
and seizing their assets.

556
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,240
-那样不...  -你是说叛徒吧
- That's no-- - You mean, traitors?

557
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,950
听着  我知道他们在密谋造反
Look, I am aware that they were plotting a coup,

558
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,880
但那还是不...
but that still doesn't--

559
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,990
是的  因为是你策划的
Yes, because you orchestrated it.

560
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,410
-什么  -否则米尔金为什么要飞去美国
- Excuse me? - Why else would Milkin fly to America?

561
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,490
这事跟我们完全无关
We had nothing to do with this.

562
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,670
你...在约旦河谷的事上就跟我撒过谎
You... you lied to me about the Jordan Valley,

563
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,950
你在迈克尔·科里根的事上跟我撒了谎
you lied to me about Michael Corrigan.

564
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,610
我不是想要推翻你  维克多
I am not trying to replace you, Viktor.

565
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,100
我是想帮你  但你也得帮我
I'm trying to help you. But you have to help me.

566
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,220
石油减产这样的威胁不会好使的
These threats of reducing your oil production, it won't work.

567
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,920
你以为抬升能源价格会伤到我们
You think jacking up energy prices is gonna hurt us,

568
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,600
但那只是敲诈
but it's just extortion.

569
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,960
我不会向敲诈低头的
And I will not respond to extortion.

570
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,380
我可以把你的叛徒送回去
Now, I'll send your traitor back,

571
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,330
但你不能再
but you've got to stop

572
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,980
查抄公司  把人变没了
seizing companies and making people disappear.

573
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,760
伊戈尔·米尔金比叛徒还糟糕  他是美国的傀儡
Igor Milkin is worse than a traitor. He's an American puppet.

574
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,180
改朝换代  那才是敲诈
Regime change, that's extortion.

575
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,150
是啊  但那是他们自己的行为  你是多虑了
Yes, but they acted on their own. You're being paranoid.

576
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,060
送他回来  别开条件
Send him back. No terms.

577
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,100
你如果不肯谈判  我们不会有进展的
We're not going to get anywhere if you're not willing to negotiate.

578
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,020
那...
Well...

579
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,450
我们没话可说了
then I believe we're finished.

580
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,980
是没什么可说了  谢谢  总统先生
And I believe you're right. Thank you, Mr. President.

581
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,920
把米尔金安置在安全地点  他哪都不能去

他讨厌你以前拿着烟去马厩

{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}国情咨文讲话一般在每年年初一二月份  国会复会后举行
其性质相当于"政府工作报告"
美国宪法规定  总统需定期向国会汇报国家发展和政府运行的状况
每年总统会借此机会  回顾总结过去一年或数年的政府工作
同时公布新一年政府的施政纲领
程序上  首先每年年初
众议院议长要代表国会向总统发出正式邀请  然后白宫接受邀请
发表国情咨文讲话当晚  总统及内阁成员会前往国会山
出席讲话的还有  最高法院的大法官
参谋长联席会议主席等三军统帅  以及国会两院的议员们
每逢此时  总统和议员们会有机会邀请一些嘉宾一同出席
受邀者往往是总统某项政策的受益者
这样他们在转播出镜时  会提醒观众政府在过去一年中的建树

632
00:39:47,960 --> 00:40:02,960
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}由于美国两党斗争激烈
所以议员们在台下落座时会根据自己党派归属而分开就座
总统在台上讲到某项政策和议题时  同党派议员会起立欢呼
而对立党派的议员们则端坐不动  面无表情
剧中民主党丢了国会多数席位  所以议长是共和党人
安德伍德讲话时可以看到同党派的副总统起立鼓掌
而共和党的议长则没什么反应

634
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:17,960
{\an5}{\pos(193,145)}由于国情咨文是美国政坛一年一度的盛事
所以第一夫人的着装也是媒体和观众关注的焦点
2016年奥巴马最后一次国情咨文讲话时
第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马所穿的黄色礼服  就非常引人注目
奥巴马的讲话还没结束  这款价格不菲的礼服便在网上被抢购一空
