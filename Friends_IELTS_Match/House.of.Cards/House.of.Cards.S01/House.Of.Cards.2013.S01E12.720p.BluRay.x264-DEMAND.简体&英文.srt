1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,610
宾夕法尼亚州  彼得・罗素议员

2
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,920
打扰了
Hey. Excuse me.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,790
我是保罗・凯普拉  来见克里斯蒂娜
I'm Paul Capra. I'm here to see Christina.

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,560
这边请  凯普拉先生  她正在等你
Oh, right this way, Mr. Capra. She's expecting you.

5
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,260
-保罗  你好  -克里斯蒂娜
- Paul. Hi. - Hey, Christina.

6
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,080
-真高兴见到你  -我也是
- It's good to see you. - Yeah, you too.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,040
吃点什么吗
Can I get you anything?

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,530
不用了  我在路上随便吃了点早饭
Nah. I grabbed some breakfast on the way down.

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,280
-那好  请坐吧  -好的  谢谢
- Okay. Have a seat. - All right. Thank you.

10
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,690
我请你来
I asked you down here

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,650
是因为我跟民主党议会竞选委员会
because I spoke to D triple C

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,080
和全国委员会讨论过了
and the D.N.C.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,520
我们希望你来竞选彼得的职位
We'd like you to run for Peter's seat.

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,520
你或许知道
As you probably know,

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,030
竞选将在二月的第一周举行
the election's been set for the first week of February.

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,020
你们想让我参选
You want me to run?

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,720
你在社区的名望很高
With your stature in the community,

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,600
又有基层的组织经验
your grass roots organizing experience...

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,710
克里斯蒂娜  等等
Christina, hold on.

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,570
我知道这事很重大
I know it's a lot to consider.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,500
这才一个月
It's only been a month.

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,140
我们还得继续执政  保罗
Well, we still have to govern, Paul.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,150
我以为你叫我来
I thought you asked me down here

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,010
是要跟我聊聊之类的
because you wanted to talk or something.

25
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,950
是啊  聊竞选的事
I do. About the election.

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,250
我是说聊彼得的事
I mean about Peter.

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,260
你怎么没来参加葬礼
How come you didn't go to the funeral?

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,220
我做不到
I couldn't.

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,360
你最近怎么样
How you been holding up?

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,870
我还好  维持机关正常运转不太容易
I'm all right. It's been hard keeping the office on track.

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,100
上帝啊  去他的机关
Jesus. Screw the office.

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,480
你自己还好吗
What about you?

33
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,510
你不用硬撑着  克里斯蒂娜
You're allowed to grieve, Christina.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,130
保罗
Paul...

35
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,360
有60万人指望着我们呢
there are 600,000 people counting on us.

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,880
我不能因为个人感情影响工作
I can't let my feelings get in the way of that.

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,820
可以听我把竞选的事说完了吗
Will you hear me out about running for Peter's seat?

38
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,870
你的审查结果相当不错
Well, you've passed the vetting process with flying colors.

39
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,860
-还有什么要补充的吗  -没有  先生
- Is there anything we might have missed? - No, sir.

40
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,710
跟我讲讲
Tell me about your

41
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,170
你担任监督改革委员会主席的经历吧
experience as the chair of the oversight reform committee.

42
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,150
我获益良多
It's been very rewarding.

43
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,310
你遇到的最严峻的挑战是什么
What are the biggest challenges you've had to face?

44
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,490
党派斗争
Partisanship.

45
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,840
美国众议院有435个席位

46
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,970
监管435个自大狂
Well, I suppose a room filled with 435 big egos

47
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,840
肯定不是件容易的事
isn't the most hospitable place for oversight.

48
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,860
你想不想成为副总统  塔比瑟
Do you want to be Vice President, Tabitha?

49
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,290
那将是无上荣幸  先生
It would be a great honor, sir.

50
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,560
我们会再联系你
We'll be in touch.

51
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,840
就这样吗
That's all?

52
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,550
-先这样吧  -谢谢您  总统先生
- For the time being. - Thank you, Mr. President.

53
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,460
我们得划掉她
We have to cross her off.

54
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,640
同意  她能把瘾君子讲睡着
I agree. She could put a crack addict to sleep.

55
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,710
那她怎么会出现在这张名单上
Then what is she doing on the goddamn list?

56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,600
塔比瑟是位很有才干的立法者
Tabitha's a very gifted legislator.

57
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,910
我不需要那些理论上可行的人
I don't want people who make sense on paper.

58
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,860
起码给我一个可选的人
I need at least one viable option.

59
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,100
列这张名单的人是你们
The two of you created this list and

60
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,450
把名字一个个划掉的也是你们
have proceeded to cross off every name you've put on it.

61
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,570
这只是初次筛选  先生
It's just a first pass, sir.

62
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,990
我们还需要时间去审查所有...
We need time to fully vet all...

63
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,390
吉姆肯定会拿下宾州州长
Jim is gonna win this thing in Pennsylvania,

64
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,970
而我们在继任者提名问题上
and we're no closer to naming his replacement

65
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,500
却原地踏步了一个月
than we were a month ago.

66
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,270
我们会再尽力找找
Let us take another crack at it

67
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,290
再找几个值得考虑的人
and give you a few more names to consider.

68
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,440
我只需要一个让人满意的
I just want one name.

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
我们会在明早前答复您
We'll have something for you by tomorrow morning.

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,630
谢谢您  总统先生
Thank you, Mr. President.

71
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,040
他现在什么都会同意的
He's ready to say yes to anything.

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,710
想成功的话  我觉得你最好别在场
Yeah, for this to work, I don't think you can be there.

73
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,960
-起码我最初提出的时候别在  -同意
- Not when I first mention it. - I agree.

74
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,120
你明早报告时提出来
You bring it up in your morning brief,

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,690
我到的时候  再故作惊讶
and when I show up, I'll act surprised.

76
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,190
如果他愿意考虑...
Assuming he's open to the idea...

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,330
明天我们只要给他灌输这个想法就行
Look, all we have to do tomorrow is plant the notion in his head.

78
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,880
你肯定能说服他的
I'm sure you'll be persuasive.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,510
-喂  -凯普拉先生吗
- Hello? - Mr. Capra?

80
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,490
是我  你是谁
Yeah. Who's this?

81
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,360
我是头条网的简宁・斯克斯基
Janine Skorsky from Slugline.

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,680
我报道罗素议员去世时曾采访过你
We spoke when I wrote the piece about Congressman Russo's passing.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,220
我不会再接受关于彼得的采访了
I'm done giving interviews about Peter, okay?

84
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,870
他有很多困扰  就这样
He was a troubled guy. End of story.

85
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,510
我不是要问他去世的事
This is not about his death.

86
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,010
我打电话是因为
I'm calling you because

87
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,220
有来自民主党议会竞选委员会的消息称
my sources at the D Triple C are telling me

88
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,650
你会竞选他的职位
that you might be running for his seat.

89
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,840
这事我不予回答
I'm not talking about that.

90
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,740
但你今早确实跟
But you did have a meeting

91
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,350
克里斯蒂娜・盖拉格见过面了吧
this morning with Christina Gallagher, correct?

92
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,060
我在开车  真的不能多聊
I'm driving right now. I really shouldn't be on the phone.

93
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,550
如果你确实要参选  我想知道
If you do run, I would like to know

94
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,630
你在关闭费城船厂一事中
about your involvement in the closing of

95
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,560
扮演了怎样的角色
the Philadelphia shipyard.

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,570
那是华盛顿的决定
That decision was made in Washington.

97
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,420
没有询问协会的意见
The association wasn't consulted.

98
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,020
抱歉  这我很难相信
Forgive me. I find that hard to believe.

99
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,650
我读过所有军事基地整合委员会的笔录
I read all of the transcripts from the BRAC Commission.

100
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,250
罗素议员没有给出任何证词
Congressman Russo didn't give any testimony.

101
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,010
那你的意思是
So are you saying that

102
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,090
他没和你们商讨就...
he didn't consult with you once before you...

103
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,210
是别人逼他的  好吗  政治手段
Somebody was strong-arming him, okay? It was politics.

104
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,410
你知道是谁给他施的压吗
Do you know who would've pressured him?

105
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,460
不知道  他说是位高权重的人
Look, I don't know. He just said people up the food chain.

106
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,850
他有具体说明...
Did he say anything more specific about...

107
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,010
车太多了  我得挂了
You know what? There's traffic. I gotta go.

108
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,710
凯普拉先生  我想...
Mr. Capra, I would...

109
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,720
我要准备应对媒体吗
Should I be prepared to do press?

110
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,030
如果他听劝的话
If he's amenable.

111
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,380
你觉得我们的胜算多大
What do you think our chances are?

112
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,860
非要说的话  超过一半吧
Better than 50-50, if I had to say.

113
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,930
马修斯胜选前我们不会宣布的
We won't announce until after Matthews wins, though.

114
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,460
我不想承认  但我很紧张
I hate to admit it, but I'm nervous.

115
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,780
我也是
So am I.

116
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,650
只是上次我们遇到这种情况...
It's just the last time, we found ourselves...

117
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,700
我也是怕这个
That's my fear too.

118
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,880
好吧  不论怎样  打给我  
All right. You call me, either way.

119
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,990
九个小时内给你电话
In no more than nine hours.

120
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,390
琳达在里面太久了
Linda's been in there far too long.

121
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,380
如果说服总统要这么久
If the President takes this much convincing,

122
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,840
那绝不是好事  我感觉得到
it doesn't bode well. I can feel it...

123
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,060
门那边他的犹豫
his hesitation on the other side of that door.

124
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,910
虽说知道结果前
I know it's pointless to worry

125
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,500
急也没有用
until I know what cards I'm holding.

126
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,350
或许他是被什么打断...
Perhaps he just got interrupted by some...

127
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,920
他想任命雷蒙德・塔斯克
He wants to tap Raymond Tusk.

128
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,400
-什么  -他觉得这想法很大胆
- What? - He thinks it's a bold idea.

129
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,690
是愚蠢才对  他从没任过公职
It's an idiotic idea. The man's never held public office.

130
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,400
这是总统喜欢他的地方之一
That's one of the things the President said he likes about him.

131
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,040
总统想在经济萧条时
The President wants to nominate

132
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,270
任命一个亿万富翁吗
a multibillionaire in a struggling economy?

133
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,530
半个国家都会与他对立
He'll alienate half the country.

134
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,870
这正是我说的
Which is exactly what I said,

135
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,030
但他说得很清楚
but he made it very clear

136
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,150
他不想让我和他争辩
he does not want me to fight him on this.

137
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,650
-那你根本没说到我  -都没有机会
- So you didn't mention me at all? - I never had the chance.

138
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,180
我能插话前他就决定好了
His mind was made up before I could say a word.

139
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,730
我们得让他改变主意
Well, we have to unmake it.

140
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,470
你可以试试  但如果你说什么
Well, you can try, but if you do,

141
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,720
我猜他只会干脆不许你再插手
my guess is he's gonna cut you out of the process altogether.

142
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
他看起来非常坚定
He seemed adamant.

143
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,380
我们该进去了
We should go in there.

144
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,180
-总统先生  -早上好  弗兰克
- Mr. President. - Morning, Frank.

145
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,600
能让我们单独谈一会儿吗  琳达
Will you give us a few minutes, Linda?

146
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,880
当然
Of course.

147
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,190
琳达告诉你了吗
Linda fill you in?

148
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,140
我觉得雷蒙德・塔斯克
I think Raymond Tusk

149
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,850
是个大胆  新奇的选择
is an exciting, bold idea.

150
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,320
很高兴你赞同我  琳达可不这么想
Well, I'm glad you agree. Linda didn't think so.

151
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,110
他是有实力的商人  聪明  但很踏实
He's a proven businessman. Brilliant, but down-to-earth.

152
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,140
你和他有私交吗
Do you know him personally?

153
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,240
我们在一次募捐会上有点头之交
I met him briefly once at a fund-raiser.

154
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,210
昨晚打给他时
Last night when I called him

155
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,620
我们才第一次深谈
was the first time we had a meaningful conversation.

156
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,710
他愿意考虑吗
Did he seem open to the idea?

157
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,290
我感觉他很不情愿
I sensed a good deal of reluctance.

158
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,670
他要几天时间来想想
He wanted a few days to consider.

159
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,940
很好  这样就有时间审查他了
Well, good. That gives us time to start vetting him.

160
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,970
他没问题  我去年就审查过他
He's clean. I had him vetted last year

161
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,580
当时想任命他为财政部长
when I was considering him for Secretary of the Treasury.

162
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,410
他有说为什么不情愿吗
And did he say why he's reluctant?

163
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,910
没说原因  只说要好好想想
No. Didn't give a reason. Just wanted to mull it over.

164
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,370
我想派人去圣路易斯和他当面谈
I want to send someone to St. Louis to speak to him in person,

165
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,390
让他接受任命
convince him to accept the nomination.

166
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,000
你有合适人选吗
And who are you thinking about?

167
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,120
我想叫琳达  但她这边工作太忙了
I'd send Linda, but there's so much work for her to do here,

168
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,210
而且她有时说话比较难听
and, well, she can be abrasive at times.

169
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,870
是啊  她是比较强势
Yeah, she can be a bit tough.

170
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,580
我要找个比较庄重的
I want someone with gravitas.

171
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,890
博奇可以考虑
Birch is a possibility,

172
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,870
但他并不总是站在我们这边
but he's not always been our strongest ally.

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,150
我看这种事不能托付给鲍勃
I'm not sure I would trust Bob with something like this.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,220
我很乐意去  先生
I would be happy to go myself, sir.

175
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,330
我会耐心规劝  给他应得的尊重
I can use a light touch and give him the respect he deserves.

176
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,510
很好  我会通知他的手下你要过去
Good. I'll let his people know you're coming.

177
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,070
-谢谢您  总统先生  -谢谢你  弗兰克
- Thank you, Mr. President. - Thank you, Frank.

178
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,780
说吧  弗兰西斯
Tell me, Francis.

179
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,980
幸好我们做了周全的准备
It's good we were prepared for anything.

180
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,410
我今晚得飞去圣路易斯
I have to fly to St. Louis tonight.

181
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,470
"是别人逼他的"
"Somebody was strong-arming him."

182
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,440
我问他是谁时  他原话是
and when I asked him who, he said, quote,

183
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,860
-"位高权重的人"  -这可是华盛顿
- "People up the food chain." - It's Washington.

184
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,120
议员受到逼迫是常事
Congressmen get strong-armed all the time.

185
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,990
我觉得是弗兰克・安德伍德
My gut says it was Frank Underwood.

186
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,340
在造船厂倒闭前  他和罗素没任何往来
He had nothing to do with Russo before the shipyard closing,

187
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,140
然后突然就支持他了
and then suddenly he's propping him up?

188
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,950
那不意味着他...
That doesn't mean he was...

189
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,080
我们别再兜圈子了  佐伊
Let's cut the bullshit once and for all, Zoe.

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,430
我知道是他给你提供信息
I know he's been feeding you your stories.

191
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,820
我不想害你
I don't want to screw you over,

192
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,300
但我会继续深入调查
but I'm not gonna stop digging on this.

193
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,770
我不会承认他是我的联络人
I won't say he was a source.

194
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,340
但你们确实认识
But you do know each other.

195
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,010
给我看你的笔记  我去和他谈
Show me your notes, and I'll talk to him.

196
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,860
这是和凯普拉通话的笔记
These are the notes from the Capra call.

197
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,580
这是军事基地整合委员会听证会的笔录
And these are the transcripts from the BRAC hearing.

198
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,680
他们讨论到费城造船厂时
When they got to the Philadelphia shipyard,

199
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,340
罗素什么都没说
Russo doesn't say anything.

200
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,130
没关系
That's fine.

201
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,360
我会把两个都拖进那个文件夹里
Yeah, I would just put both of them in that file.

202
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,760
克莱尔  我刚接到桑科公关部的电话
Claire, I just got a call from the P.R. office at Sancorp

203
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,260
他们想派摄制组来
saying they wanted to send a film crew

204
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,620
拍我们在博茨瓦纳的滤水项目
to take footage of our filtration project in Botswana.

205
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,430
对  他们要用它做宣传片
Right. They're just using that for promotional material.

206
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,380
桑科反对我们的流域法案
Sancorp fought us on the watershed bill.

207
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,330
他们帮我们把滤水器运出了南苏丹
They helped us get the filters out of South Sudan.

208
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,710
那不是国务院做的吗
I thought that was the State Department.

209
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,490
不  你记得雷米・丹顿吗
No. You remember Remy Danton?

210
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,460
你刚来这里工作时曾在办公室见过他
You met him in your office right after you started working here.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,240
-那个说客  -我找他帮的忙
- The lobbyist. - I asked him for his help.

212
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,530
现在只是投桃报李  就这样
We're just returning the favor, that's all.

213
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,210
克莱尔  他们的立场和我们完全相反
Claire, they're against everything we stand for.

214
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,670
没关系的  他们会把影片
It's harmless. They'll send the video

215
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,580
发给几个投资者  做些宣传
to a few of their investors and make some commercials.

216
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,600
这让我很不舒服
This makes me very uncomfortable... the idea...

217
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,810
他们会派摄制组来  吉莉安
They are sending the film crew, Gillian,

218
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,550
请好好配合他们
so please work with them on that.

219
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,980
我的同事在调查彼得・罗素
One of my colleagues is looking into Peter Russo.

220
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,970
认为他关闭造船厂是受你所迫
The assumption is you strong-armed him into closing the shipyard.

221
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,470
你同事从哪得来的消息
Where does your colleague get their information?

222
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,440
我不知道
I don't know.

223
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,780
国防部预算的分配一直是自由竞争
Allocating the D.O.D. budget is always a free-for-all.

224
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,150
你对他施过压吗
Did you pressure him?

225
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,070
船厂早日关闭
There were certain people that were gonna benefit

226
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,670
确实对某些人有好处
from the base closing sooner rather than later.

227
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,310
我没有逼迫彼得
I didn't strong-arm Peter.

228
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,700
我只是建议他化腐朽为优势
I advised him to trade in a losing hand for a winning one.

229
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,340
他得到什么优势了
How did he stand to win?

230
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,880
化敌为友
He made allies out of enemies.

231
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,600
这在国会非常可贵
That's a very valuable thing in Congress.

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,990
真希望我能给你更有料的信息
I wish I could give you something juicier,

233
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,240
但造船厂的关闭只是寻常的政治手腕
but the shipyard closing was just politics as usual.

234
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,730
我猜那个同事是斯克斯基女士
I assume your colleague is Ms. Skorsky.

235
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,390
她知道我们的关系吗
Does she know we're talking?

236
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,950
当然不知道
No. Of course not.

237
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,170
保持联络
Be in touch.

238
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,880
雷蒙德・艾伦・塔斯克的全部资料
More than you ever wanted to know about Raymond Alan Tusk...

239
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,510
他掌控的公司  政治贡献
the companies he controls, political contributions.

240
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,620
《绅士季刊》的文章  《乡野亿万富翁》
A GQ article entitled "Backwoods billionaire"

241
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,860
-说的是他在中西部的低调生活  -老天
- is about his humble midwestern lifestyle. - Jesus.

242
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,300
还有一份财务状况的披露要求
There's also a copy of the financial disclosure requirements

243
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,090
和保密委托的细节
and details of the blind trust.

244
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,040
我觉得你该从委托入手
I think the trust is where you want to focus.

245
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,480
这会是琳达的主意吗
Could Linda be behind all this?

246
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,840
什么目的
To what end?

247
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,500
调你出城几天
To get you out of town for a few days

248
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,800
只剩他们俩继续找人选
while they continue the search without your interference.

249
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,040
总统没理由不信任我
The President has no reason to mistrust me.

250
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,380
除非琳达告诉他你想当副总统
Unless Linda told him you want the Vice Presidency.

251
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,070
不  她陷得太深了
No. She's in way too deep.

252
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,410
国务卿提名的事我们就失误了
We misjudged her on the Secretary of State nomination.

253
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,300
那不一样  那次是攻我不备
That was different. She blindsided me.

254
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,010
现在她知道我眼观六路呢
Now she knows my eyes are wide open.

255
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,850
您要私人行装还是商务行头
Do you want the Gaffney bag or regular business?

256
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,190
商务行头  塔斯克愿穿便服是他的事
Regular business. Tusk can dress down if he wants to,

257
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,800
但我代表的是白宫
but I'm representing the White House.

258
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,780
让沃尔特・道尔查塔斯克
Oh, and get Walter Doyle onto Tusk.

259
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,350
看看能挖到什么料
Let's see if we can dig up anything.

260
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,130
我这就打给他
I'll call him right now.

261
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,500
我离开这段时间留意简宁・斯克斯基
And keep your eye on Janine Skorsky while I'm away.

262
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,450
她在打听罗素的事
She's been prying into Russo.

263
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,450
她知道什么
What does she know?

264
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,860
她的问题切中要害
She knows the right questions to ask.

265
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,090
要确保她得不到正确答案
I want to make sure she doesn't get the right answers.

266
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,060
我知道了
I'm on it.

267
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,330
麦喀顿
McCuddin.

268
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,850
麦喀顿
McCuddin.

269
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,920
你说什么
What was that?

270
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,040
麦喀顿空军基地
McCuddin Air Force Base.

271
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,850
军事基地整合委员会于4月12日举行听证
BRAC hearing. Was there on April 12th.

272
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,910
不到一周后大卫・拉斯姆森离职
David Rasmussen stepped down less than a week later.

273
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,900
乌麦克接替了他  很可能...
Womack takes his place. So maybe...

274
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,980
等下  慢点
Wait. Slow down.

275
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,410
麦喀顿在他的选区
McCudden is in his district.

276
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,350
是造船厂那事吗
Is that the shipyard thing?

277
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,110
简宁  给我回电
Janine, call me back.

278
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,760
我想是乌麦克给罗素施了压
I think it was Womack who pressured Russo.

279
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,170
罗素可能只是想卖个人情
Russo was probably just earning a favor

280
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,880
回头再找回来
he could cash in later.

281
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,420
我随时都在
I'm around.

282
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,290
你有没有为阻止她报道而跟她争过
Did you ever have to fight her to kill a story?

283
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,050
简宁吗
Janine?

284
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,410
对  她还是你手下的时候
Yeah. When she worked for you.

285
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,780
只有在我知道她不对的时候
Only when I knew she was wrong.

286
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,710
她想写一篇阴谋论的报道
She's trying to draw up this whole conspiracy thing

287
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,310
涉及罗素  弗兰克・安德伍德
with Russo and Frank Underwood

288
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,520
还有造船厂关闭的事
and the whole shipyard closing.

289
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,290
我觉得是她错了
But I'm pretty sure she's wrong.

290
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,230
-觉得不代表确定  -不  我确定
- Pretty sure isn't the same as certain. - No. I am certain.

291
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,400
-你怎么知道  -我有联络人
 - How do you know? - I have sources.

292
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,000
-安德伍德吗  -不是
- Underwood? - No.

293
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,190
算了  我再想想
No. Never mind. I'll figure it out.

294
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,240
-塔斯克太太  -叫我珍就好了
- Mrs. Tusk? - Jean, please.

295
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,370
你一定是弗兰克了  快请进
You must be Frank. Come in.

296
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,370
很高兴见到你
So nice to meet you.

297
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,650
客房在这边
The guest room is this way.

298
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,160
邀请我来住  真是太贴心了
It is very kind of you to have invited me to stay here.

299
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,000
我们这儿有舒适的床
Why waste the taxpayers' money on a hotel

300
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,130
何必浪费纳税人的钱住宾馆呢
when we have a perfectly good bed?

301
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,240
纳税人和我都十分感激
Well, both they and I are very grateful.

302
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,900
抱歉雷蒙德睡下了不能来迎你
I'm sorry Raymond isn't awake to greet you.

303
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,570
-他睡觉...  -我知道他习惯早起
- He goes to bed at... - I know he's an early riser.

304
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,850
我理解的
I understand.

305
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,230
你要我早上敲门叫你吗
Would you like a wake-up knock?

306
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,710
不用了  我手机上有闹铃
No. I have an alarm on my phone.

307
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,790
-晚安  -非常感谢
- Sleep tight. - Thank you so much.

308
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,070
我想问早安  但现在是大半夜
I would say good morning, but it's the middle of the night.

309
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,220
-见到你很高兴  -我也是
- It's a pleasure to meet you. - And you too.

310
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,430
我太吵了吗
Was I making too much noise?

311
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,860
不是  我闻到了培根香
No. I smelled bacon.

312
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,120
给你
Here.

313
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,090
咖啡还是酒
Coffee? Booze?

314
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,520
凌晨两点  任你选
2:00 a.m., you can go either way.

315
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,040
来杯水就好
Just water for now.

316
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,840
过滤过的水  你妻子会喜欢的
It's filtered. Your wife would approve.

317
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,720
你之前来过圣路易斯吗
You ever been to St. Louis before?

318
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,970
只来过机场
Just the airport.

319
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,420
你有什么看法
What do you think so far?

320
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,890
我只看到了你家一带
Well, I've only seen your neighborhood

321
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,200
还有州际公路沿途的风景
and whatever I could see out the window on the interstate.

322
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,650
可以了  看起来都差不多
Good enough. It's all pretty much the same.

323
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,540
抱歉
Excuse me.

324
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,680
喂

325
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,490
请等一等

326
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,200
我马上回来

327
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,530
听着  我还没洗澡
Listen, um, I still haven't showered.

328
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,950
还在想着中国的事
My mind is on China here.

329
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,310
不如你再睡一会儿
Uh, what do you say you get a few more zs

330
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,470
我们几小时后再好好谈
and we try this again in a few hours with our clothes on?

331
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,280
好啊
Sounds like a plan.

332
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,940
九点半在我办公室见
Meet me at my office at 9:30.

333
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,610
我派司机来接你
I'll have a driver pick you up.

334
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,440
能问下你为什么要那样做吗
Can I ask why you do that?

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,150
-做什么  -敲你的戒指
- Do what? - Tap your ring like that.

336
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,510
我在电视上见你那么做过
I've seen you do it on TV.

337
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,220
每次起身离桌或是结束演讲你都会那么做
Two taps every time you get up from a table or leave a lectern.

338
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,880
我父亲教我的
Something my father taught me.

339
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,640
可以强健指关节
It's meant to harden your knuckles

340
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,890
打架的时候就不会弄断它们
so you don't break them if you get into a fight.

341
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,960
而且还顺道敲了木头[西方的吉兆]
It also has the added benefit of knocking on wood.

342
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,740
我父亲认为成功
My father believed that success

343
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,170
准备和运气缺一不可
is a mixture of preparation and luck.

344
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,410
敲敲桌子可以一石二鸟
Tapping the table kills both birds with one stone.

345
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,050
你父亲不是个桃农吗
Your father was a peach farmer?

346
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,090
是的  而且做得并不好
Yes, he was. Not a very successful one.

347
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,270
-少了准备还是运气  -都少
- Lack of preparation or lack of luck? - Lack of both.

348
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,920
他说得好做不好
He was better at giving advice than following it.

349
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,830
喂

350
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,930
我看过你的报告了

351
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,020
这会给对方施加压力

352
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,490
小姐  小姐  你的卡
Miss? Miss, your card.

353
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,620
谢谢
Thank you.

354
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,150
盖拉格小姐  我是简宁・斯克斯基
Ms. Gallagher, my name's Janine Skorsky.

355
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,620
我是头条网的记者
I'm a reporter at Slugline.

356
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,230
-我写了关于议员的专访...  -我记得
- I wrote the profile on Congressman... - I remember.

357
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,150
-你有空吗  -如果这是关于彼得  我...
- Do you have a minute? - If this is about Peter, I...

358
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,740
不  是关于保罗・凯普拉
No. It's about Paul Capra.

359
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,530
我们知道他可能会接替罗素竞选议员
We know that he might be running for Congressman Russo's old seat.

360
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,900
我不能发表意见
I can't comment on that.

361
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,940
我们只是在调查去年四月
We're just trying to do some background

362
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,530
造船厂倒闭一事的背景
on the shipyard closing last April.

363
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,570
听着  我只想好好吃顿早饭
Listen, I just want to eat my breakfast.

364
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,610
我们得到消息称
We have sources that are saying

365
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,340
有人对议员施压
that the Congressman was being pressured by someone

366
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,300
让他不做抗争
to not fight the closure.

367
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,010
-谁  -我正在查
- Who? - That's what I'm trying to figure out.

368
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,110
我保证我们的谈话不会见报
This is completely off the record, I promise you.

369
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,050
-你好  克里斯蒂娜  -道格  你好
- Hi, Christina. - Doug, hi.

370
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,010
-你还好吗  -还好
- How you holding up? - I'm okay.

371
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,840
我很好
I'm... I'm good.

372
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,710
我看你坐在这儿  介不介意...
I saw you sitting over here. You mind if I...

373
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,820
不介意  请吧
No. Please.

374
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,950
斯克斯基女士  对吗
Ms. Skorsky, right?

375
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,940
你以前在《先驱报》时我们谈过几次
I believe we spoke a few times when you used to work at the Herald.

376
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,950
如果我能突破新闻处找到你
Whenever I could get past the press office gauntlet to you.

377
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,810
我们管理很严格
We do like to run a tight ship.

378
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,170
你为什么来国会大厦
So what brings you to the Capitol?

379
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,110
我只想问问盖拉格小姐
I was just asking Ms. Gallagher

380
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,380
谁在竞选填补宾州第一选区的议员一职
who's running to fill the vacant seat in Pennsylvania's 1st.

381
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,910
实话说  我们不知道
Well, the honest answer is we don't know.

382
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,420
谢谢你抽出时间  盖拉格小姐
Thank you for your time, Ms. Gallagher.

383
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,200
有谁来问你你不想回答的问题
Anyone starts harassing you with questions you don't want to answer,

384
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,580
就告诉我
you let me know.

385
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,610
我会处理
I'll handle them.

386
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,690
你要忙的事已经够多了
You got enough on your plate right now.

387
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,860
谢谢  道格  我很感激
Thanks, Doug. I appreciate that.

388
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,450
坚持住  好吗
Hang in there, okay?

389
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,090
行
Yes.

390
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,110
乌干达
Uganda,

391
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,520
秘鲁
Peru,

392
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,820
尼泊尔
Nepal,

393
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,390
印度尼西亚
Indonesia...

394
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,930
尼加拉瓜
Nicaragua.

395
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,170
你的旅行经历可真够丰富的
Well, you are quite the well traveled man.

396
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,980
不不  我是个居家的人
No. I'm the man who stays at home.

397
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,510
这些都是珍给我带回来的
Jean brought those back for me.

398
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,400
-塔斯克先生  我...  -叫名字就好
- Mr. Tusk, I am... - First names.

399
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,060
毕竟  我们一起吃过培根
After all, we have broken bacon together.

400
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,580
可以认为我们挺熟的了
We can safely assume that we're familiar.

401
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,460
雷蒙德  我知道你是个大忙人
Raymond, I realize that you are a very busy man,

402
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,580
那我就直切主题了
so I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

403
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,660
总统诚挚地希望
The President sincerely would like you

404
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,970
你能出任下届副总统
to become the next Vice President.

405
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,500
这个我已经知道了
That part I already knew.

406
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,250
我是来说服你同意的
And I'm here to convince you to say yes.

407
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,840
这我也知道
Another thing I already knew.

408
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,350
那就不知道
Well, I don't know that

409
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,690
我能不能告诉你什么新消息了
I can tell you anything you don't already know.

410
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,360
但也许你能告诉我  你的顾虑是什么
But perhaps you can tell me what your hesitation is.

411
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,130
请说
Speak.

412
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,050
行
Yes.

413
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,810
我理解  你有些顾忌
Now, I understand you might have some concerns

414
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,290
财务状况公开所导致的...
about the financial disclosures leading...

415
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,900
请说
Speak.

416
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,860
不行
No.

417
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,490
此时此刻  在六个时区有八个人
I have eight people representing me at eight

418
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,710
在八个同时召开的会议上代表我
simultaneous meetings in six time zones right now.

419
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,740
我就坐在这儿回答问题
I sit here and answer their questions,

420
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,910
但问题必须用简单的肯否定就能回答
provided they come in the form of a single yes or no proposition.

421
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,200
那么  让我试试
Well, then, let me give that a try.

422
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,330
你愿意担任副总统吗
Would you like to be the Vice President?

423
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,840
愿意还是不愿意
Yes or no?

424
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,860
稍等一会儿
Hold on a minute.

425
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,490
非常抱歉
I am very sorry.

426
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,860
给我二十分钟  了结这些会议
Let me have 20 minutes to wrap up these meetings.

427
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,490
然后我们离开办公室
And then what do you say we get out of the office

428
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,560
远离这该死的电话
and away from this damn phone?

429
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,150
去我车那里等我
Meet me at my car.

430
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,920
贝蒂会告诉你停车位置
Betty can tell you where it's parked.

431
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,780
说吧
Go ahead.

432
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,680
他在回避
He's deflecting.

433
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,700
我分辨不出是因为
What I can't tell is whether it's because

434
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,640
他想拒绝  还是想让我哄着他答应
he's inclined to say no or wants to be wooed to say yes.

435
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,920
不管怎样  我得慢慢引他说话
Either way, I'll have to ease him into the conversation,

436
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,400
不能太直白了
not be so blunt.

437
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,070
这趟行程恐怕会比预计要长
This trip may take longer than I thought.

438
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,300
我们已经找遍了所有的文件柜
We've looked through all the file cabinets.

439
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,560
他电脑里没记录吗
They're not on his computer?

440
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,790
议员手写的便条没有
Not with the Congressman's handwritten notes.

441
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,680
知道了  我去他办公室看看
All right. I'll check his office.

442
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,760
这片树林能给人慰藉
There is a comfort to these woods.

443
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,280
这儿就像我的后院
Like they're my backyard.

444
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,870
其实可以这么说  这块地是我的
Well, they are my backyard, in a way. I own them.

445
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,710
多少地
How much land?

446
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,880
六千英亩
Six thousand acres.

447
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,680
我这几天能去看看你的富顿电站吗
You think I could get a tour of your Fulton plant while I'm in town?

448
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,770
如果你想  但...
If you'd like. But...

449
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,940
我不懂你撇下这美景
I don't know why you'd want to be there

450
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,710
跑那儿去做什么
when you could be out here.

451
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,790
我从没见过核电站
I've never seen a nuclear plant.

452
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,460
没什么可看的
Not much to see.

453
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,630
钢筋混凝土  到处是蒸汽
Steel, concrete, a lot of steam.

454
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,590
总统并不是很支持核能
The President hasn't exactly been a big supporter of nuclear power.

455
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,430
那是你犹豫的原因吗
Is that, uh, part of your hesitation...

456
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,630
害怕政府...
that fear that the administration...

457
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,550
他只是圆润处事罢了
He's just being savvy.

458
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,190
日本核爆后核能很难让人接受
Nuclear energy is a tough sell after Japan.

459
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,010
但这又是目前唯一
But it's the only option we have right now

460
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,830
不会完全毁坏地球的能源
that doesn't completely trash the planet.

461
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,880
反对核能的观点都是感情用事
The argument against nuclear power is an emotional one.

462
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,160
你不凭感情做决定
And you don't make decisions based on emotion.

463
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,240
凭感情做的决定不叫决定
Decisions based on emotion aren't decisions at all.

464
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,850
那是直觉
They're instincts,

465
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,090
但也很有价值
which can be of value.

466
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,030
理性和非理性是互补的
The rational and the irrational complement each other.

467
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,520
分开就无力许多
Individually, they're far less powerful.

468
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,620
那你对副总统一职的考虑
And which category do your thoughts on the

469
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,750
是直觉还是决定呢
vice presidency fall into?

470
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,640
听到鸟叫声了吗
Do you hear that song?

471
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,950
是只隐居鸫
It's a hermit thrush.

472
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,930
看不见他
Can't see him.

473
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,190
孤独的鸫鸟
"Solitary, the thrush...

474
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,330
隐居起来  自我流放
"The hermit, withdrawn to himself,

475
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,350
离开居巢
"avoiding the settlements,

476
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,860
独自歌唱
"sings by himself a song."

477
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,840
-知道这首诗吗  -不知道
- Do you know the poem? - No, I don't.

478
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,220
沃尔特・惠特曼[美国诗人]的诗
It's Walt Whitman.

479
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,590
写亚伯拉罕・林肯之死的
It's about the death of Abraham Lincoln.

480
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,450
他就在那边
He's over there somewhere.

481
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,480
我当然知道那首破诗
Yes, I know the damn poem.

482
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,320
在桑蒂诺学过
We studied it at the Sentinel.

483
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,550
我问教授
I said to my Professor,

484
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,270
为什么要悼念总统或任何死去的人呢
"Why mourn the death of Presidents, or anyone for that matter?

485
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,620
死人又听不到
"The dead can't hear us."

486
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,910
而他问我是否信天堂
And he asked me if I believed in heaven.

487
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,240
我说不
I said no.

488
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,890
他又问我是否不信上帝
And then he asked if I had no faith in God.

489
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,700
我说  你错了
I said, "You have it wrong.

490
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,280
是上帝不信我们
"It's God who has no faith in us."

491
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,130
去树林深处吧
Deeper into the woods.

492
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,750
我觉得你太多疑了
I think you're being paranoid.

493
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:00,170
我一坐下他就来了  很诡异
He came up right after I sat down. It was creepy.

494
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,960
我跟你说  是乌麦克
I'm telling you, it was Womack.

495
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,090
安德伍德说的
Is that what Underwood said?

496
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,400
他没明说  但还能有谁
He didn't name names. But who else?

497
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,080
这怎么了  议员互做人情  很正常
What's the big deal? Congressmen trade favors.

498
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,880
其中一个自杀了
One of these congressmen committed suicide.

499
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,970
我觉得你在瞎想  简宁  想把...
I think you're stretching here, Janine. To try and connect...

500
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,830
我追过大鱼
I have gone after big fish before.

501
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,300
我知道被监视是什么感觉
I know what it feels like to be watched.

502
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,800
乌麦克当上多数党领袖三天
Underwood's education bill went to the floor

503
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,730
安德伍德的教育法案就进入投票
just three days after Womack became majority leader.

504
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,310
你泄露了教育法案的初稿
You leaked the education bill.

505
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,830
还有科恩的社论
And then there was the Kern article.

506
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,030
那是完全不同的两件事
Those were two completely different stories.

507
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,670
等等  那人是谁
Wait. What was the guy?

508
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,790
叫什么来着  
Uh, what was his name?

509
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,340
爆料说科恩为校报写了那篇社论
He's the one who told that Kern wrote the article for the school paper.

510
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,870
-罗伊・科佩尼科  -你该去找他
- Roy Kapeniak. - You should go talk to him.

511
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,240
-这没联系  -你就是联系
- There's no link. - Except you.

512
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,290
安德伍德在利用你  佐伊
Underwood's been using you, Zoe.

513
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,860
你不想知道原因吗
Don't you want to know why?

514
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,000
雷米・丹顿在二号线
Remy Danton's on line two.

515
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,750
他说有要事
He says it's important.

516
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,620
-你好  雷米  -你好  克莱尔
- Hello, Remy. - Hey, Claire.

517
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,320
我刚接到桑科公关部的电话
I got a call from the P.R. Team at Sancorp.

518
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,920
说吉莉安・科尔不合作
They said Gillian Cole isn't being cooperative.

519
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,890
你是说她还没回复他们吗
Hasn't gotten back to them, you mean?

520
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,380
不  她直接说她不想让摄制组去
No. Told them point-blank she doesn't want the film crew there.

521
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,010
我在看她的邮件  她说
I'm looking at an e-mail. She wrote that

522
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,760
他们会破坏项目和当地社区
they would be disruptive to the project and local community.

523
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,340
那是她的还是你的意思
Is that her, or is that coming from you?

524
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,650
不  我明确说过  让她配合工作
No. I made it very clear that I wanted her to work with them.

525
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,180
看来她完全违背了你的要求
Well, it seems like she's doing the opposite.

526
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,200
我跟她谈谈
I will speak to her,

527
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,400
之后亲自向公关部解释
and then I'll sort things out with the P.R. Team personally.

528
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,320
-谢谢  克莱尔  -不客气
- Thank you, Claire. - You bet.

529
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,160
吉莉安去吃午饭了吗
Is Gillian at lunch?

530
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,520
她今天没来  身体不舒服
She didn't come in yet today. She's not feeling well.

531
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,200
她来了告诉我
Let me know when she gets here.

532
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,350
-你飞机几点的  -6点40
- What time is your flight? - 6:40.

533
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,140
那走吧  这会儿有点堵车
We should get going. There's gonna be traffic.

534
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,140
快好了
Almost ready.

535
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,760
我一直在想
I've been thinking.

536
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,890
你交往的那个老男人
The, uh, older man you were with.

537
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,350
是安德伍德吗
Was it Underwood?

538
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,340
那么你其实是想保住你自己
So, what this is really about is covering your own ass.

539
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,920
不对
That is not true.

540
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,750
你不想让人知道你和他上床
You don't want anybody to know you were sleeping with him.

541
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,340
这可不是客观报道  对吧
Not exactly objective reporting, is it?

542
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,260
不用你给我讲新闻伦理
Don't fucking lecture me on journalistic ethics.

543
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,420
你在《先驱报》时有多少新闻
How many of the stories you brought me at the herald

544
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,780
-是你通过...  -我不想谈这个
- were because you were... - I'm not gonna have this conversation.

545
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,480
好  那你自己打车去机场吧
Fine. Maybe you should take a cab to the airport.

546
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,470
别因为我坦诚而惩罚我
Don't punish me for being honest.

547
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,870
你不坦诚  是我问出来的
You haven't been honest. I had to ask.

548
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,440
而且你还没给我一个直接的回答
And you still haven't given me a straight answer.

549
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,410
是
Yes.

550
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,880
是他
It was him.

551
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,510
我不知道我能不能接受  佐伊
I... I don't know if I can do this, Zoe.

552
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,990
-什么意思  -你为了上位和议员上床
- Do what? - You fucked a Congressman to get ahead.

553
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,710
我不是第一个这么做的人  卢卡斯
I'm not the first person to ever do something like that, Lucas.

554
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,240
可是我没和别人上床  不是吗
But I'm not sleeping with those other people, am I?

555
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,680
那你现在恨我了
What, so you just hate me now?

556
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,710
不  我可能爱上你了
No. I probably love you.

557
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,160
这才是问题
That's the fucking problem.

558
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,730
走吧  我违章停车了
Let's go. I'm parked illegally.

559
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:14,560
我听说你们今天去林子里走了走
So I hear you went stomping through the woods today.

560
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,350
是的  然后雷蒙德还
We did, and then Raymond was kind enough

561
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,620
安排我去富顿电站参观
to arrange a tour of the Fulton plant.

562
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,270
我敢肯定你在想
And I'm sure you were wondering,

563
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,560
这个老东西什么时候才能说正事
"When is this old fool gonna get around to brass tacks?"

564
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,410
我来就是为了回答问题
I'm here to simply answer questions.

565
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,440
我想等你准备好了  自会做决定
I figured that you would make up your mind when you're ready.

566
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,700
这里有两个人
There are two minds here.

567
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,590
我们非常了解保密委托
We know all about the blind trust.

568
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,060
有什么让你们担心的吗
Does it concern either of you?

569
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,010
保密和委托
The words "Blind" And "Trust"

570
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,760
绝非我最喜欢的英语单词
are not among my favorites in the English language.

571
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,420
但理论上  我并不反对
But I have no problem with it in theory.

572
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,990
几年内不必管理我们的资产
Not managing our assets for a few years

573
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,020
确实可以减轻我们许多压力
could unburden us from a great deal of stress.

574
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,320
那还有什么不情愿的地方
Well, then, what does your reluctance stem from?

575
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,450
你觉得总统为什么要找我
Why do you think the President wants me?

576
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,710
我不能代表他说话  但如果我要...
Well, I can't speak on his behalf, but if I were to...

577
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,560
你来不就是为了代表他说话吗
Aren't you here to do just that... speak on his behalf?

578
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,300
如果让我推测  我认为总统...
If I were to speculate, I think the President would prob...

579
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,460
推测可不是一种好的投资方式
Speculation is a poor form of investment

580
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,840
同样也不是一种好的政治手段
and an equally poor form of politics.

581
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,060
把你知道的告诉我们
Tell me what you know.

582
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,900
我不明白你的意思
I don't know what you mean.

583
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,400
你觉得我应该怎么做
Well, what do you think I should do?

584
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,740
作为你个人  弗兰克・安德伍德
You, personally, Frank Underwood?

585
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,490
我的意见并不重要
My opinion isn't what matters here.

586
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,440
对我来说很重要  我应该去吗  去还是不去
It does to me. Should I do it? Yes or no?

587
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,530
需要考虑很多事情
Well, there's a great number of things to consider...

588
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,760
我肯定你都已经考虑过了
And I'm sure you've considered them all.

589
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,510
去还是不去  弗兰克
Yes or no, Frank?

590
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,980
不  我不会回答这个问题
No, I will not answer that question.

591
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,580
因为你觉得我不该去  
Because you think I shouldn't.

592
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,020
因为我的想法不重要
Because it's not relevant.

593
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,600
那好  我换个方式问你
All right, then. Let me ask you another way.

594
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,670
你会接受这份工作吗  
Would you take the job?

595
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,940
总统没找我
It hasn't been offered to me.

596
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,160
如果找了呢
What if it were?

597
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,030
我讨厌假设
I have a distaste for hypotheticals

598
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,970
就像你讨厌推测一样
just the same as you have a distaste for speculation.

599
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,820
好  好吧
All right, all right.

600
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,100
公事到此为止  我们可以明天继续谈
That's enough business for now. We can discuss it more tomorrow.

601
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,910
进来  进来  布鲁斯
Get in. Get in there, Bruce.

602
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,560
抱歉  抱歉打扰你了  女士
Sorry. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

603
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,130
我找罗伊・科佩尼科
Um, I'm looking for Roy Kapeniak.

604
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,780
我以为他的拖车在那边  我找对地方了吗
I thought his trailer was over here. Am I in the right place?

605
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,540
一个月前的话你就找对地方了
You're in the right place a month ago.

606
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,250
他被赶走了
He got evicted.

607
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,540
总是在院子里打枪
He was shootin' off his gun too much in the yard.

608
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,100
你知道我该去哪找他吗
Do you know where I can find him?

609
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,060
找他干什么
Why?

610
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,710
我是他的亲戚  他的侄女
I'm a relative. His... his niece.

611
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,620
据我所知是出城了
Skipped town is what I heard.

612
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,760
有个姑娘和他一起生活  也许她知道
Had a girl livin' with him. Maybe she knows.

613
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,590
-叫艾柯  -艾柯
- Name was Echo. - Echo?

614
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,680
她自己这么说
That's what she went by, at least.

615
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,670
在40号公路那边的脱衣舞俱乐部工作
Works at the titty bar over on 40.

616
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,780
40号高速公路
Highway 40?

617
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,720
-过了汉堡王就是  -好的  谢谢
- Across from the Burger King. - Okay. Thank you.

618
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,770
21岁以下禁止入内  请出示身份证件  违法者将被起诉

619
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,800
姑娘免费进
Girls get in free.

620
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,690
-我找艾柯  -谁
- I'm looking for Echo. - Who?

621
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:02,610
艾柯
Echo.

622
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,140
罗伊是个疯子
Roy was a fucking wacko.

623
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,260
我和他同居真是蠢死了
I was stupid to live with him as long as I did.

624
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,080
-你知道他现在在哪吗  -不知道也不在乎
- Do you know where he is now? - I don't know, and I don't care.

625
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,880
他有没有说过我写的那篇报道
He ever talk about the article I wrote?

626
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,510
整天唠叨  还裱起来了
All the time. He had it framed.

627
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,950
应该还在拖车里
Bet it's still in the trailer

628
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,550
如果那车没进废车场的话
if it's not in a junkyard right now.

629
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,830
他说过为什么打电话给我吗
Did he say why he called me?

630
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,010
-跟你说过吗  -我当时在场
- Did he ever tell you? - I was there.

631
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,290
-什么意思  -那人来的时候
- Where? - When the guy showed up.

632
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,090
谁
Who?

633
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,350
我不会写你的名字
I won't name names.

634
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,340
别管罗伊・科佩尼科了
Fuck Roy Kapeniak.

635
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,570
你又不欠他什么
You don't owe him shit.

636
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,380
那人说他是个议员
Some guy who said he was a Congressman.

637
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,060
是...
Was it...

638
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,930
他吗
him?

639
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,210
不是
No.

640
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,000
那人要年轻一点  高一点
He was younger, tall,

641
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
头发很少  长得不错
not much hair, pretty good-looking.

642
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,660
-对  就是他  -你肯定
- Yeah, that was him. - You're absolutely sure?

643
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,340
他带了波旁酒  毒品  待了一晚上
He brought bourbon, blow, stayed the whole night.

644
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,840
整件事都是他的主意
The whole thing was his idea.

645
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,300
说那篇社论是科恩写的
What, to say that Kern wrote the editorial?

646
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,780
那人什么都没做  都是罗伊写的
That guy didn't write anything. It was all Roy.

647
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,970
好的  我知道我说过不会写你的名字
Okay, look, I know I said that I wouldn't name names,

648
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,580
如果你坚持我是不会写
and I won't if that's what you want.

649
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,110
但你可以因此一夜成名
But you could be famous overnight.

650
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,100
脱口秀  电视  全国...
Talk shows, TV, the whole country...

651
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,890
想都别想
No way.

652
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,550
你不用再跳舞了
You wouldn't have to dance anymore.

653
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,430
你想干什么都行
You could do whatever you want.

654
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,210
别他妈写我名字  好吗
Don't use my fucking name, okay?

655
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,940
我都说了不该说的了
I already said more than I should have.

656
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,410
-斯坦普  都半夜了  -两件事  先生
- Stamper, it's midnight. - Two things, boss.

657
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,940
第一件  简宁・斯克斯基
First, Janine Skorsky

658
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,990
今早去找了克里斯蒂娜
ambushed Christina this morning.

659
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,220
在她能提更多问题前被我拦下了
I intercepted her before she could ask too much.

660
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,070
-要担心吗  -我能控制住  先生
- Should we be worried? - I can keep this contained, sir.

661
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,260
只是告诉你一声
I just wanted you to know.

662
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,940
好的  还有件事呢
All right. What's the other thing?

663
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,780
道尔的调查做完了
Doyle came back with his research.

664
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,090
我刚发你邮箱了
I just e-mailed it to you.

665
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,230
总统跟你说他不认识塔斯克  对吗
The President told you he and Tusk didn't know each other, right?

666
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,850
是的  他说他们只见过一面
Yeah. He said they met once, I think,

667
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,310
在一个募捐会上
at a fund-raiser.

668
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,750
看来他说谎了
That would appear to be a lie.

669
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,870
好的  我打开邮件了
All right. I have it in front of me now.

670
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,630
道尔列出了他能查到的
Doyle catalogued all the instances he could find

671
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,470
他们俩同时出现在同一城市的情况
in which the two of them were in the same city at the same time.

672
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,050
红色项是他们共同出席的活动
Items in red are events that they both attended.

673
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,620
他还查到了别的
And he found something else.

674
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,540
沃克之前做私营生意的时候
Back in Walker's private sector days,

675
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,030
他曾是先锋航空公司的执行总裁
he was the C.E.O. of Pioneer Airlines.

676
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,610
公司被卖给美联航时
Guess who owned a third of the stock

677
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,160
猜猜谁拥有三分之一的股份
when it was sold to united?

678
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,290
雷蒙德・塔斯克
Raymond Tusk.

679
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,820
我猜他和沃克相当熟
My guess is that he and Walker know each other quite well.

680
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,170
好的  我再看下邮件  回头打给你
All right. Let me look this over. I'll call you back.

681
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,430
我被耍了
I'm being played.

682
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,640
为什么
But why?

683
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,850
在台湾

684
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,590
有什么样的投资

685
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,150
-我又把你吵醒了  -没有
- Did I wake you again? - No.

686
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,520
我想谈谈
I'd like to talk.

687
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,220
稍等一下
Give me a moment.

688
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,940
我刚刚说

689
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,410
我要知道

690
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,100
现在那里

691
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,860
好了  就这样

692
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,630
卡罗莱纳长尾鹦鹉
Carolina Parakeet.

693
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,470
不对  但很接近了
You're wrong, but you're close.

694
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,040
这是太阳锥尾鹦鹉
This is the Sun Conure.

695
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,790
看起来很相似
They look very similar,

696
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,760
但卡罗莱纳长尾鹦鹉已经灭绝了
but the Carolina Parakeet is extinct.

697
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,240
被认为有害  所以被杀尽了
Was killed off because it was considered a pest.

698
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,410
却是个很有趣的物种
Interesting species, though.

699
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,360
贪食
Voracious appetite.

700
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,550
还有毒  猫吃了它会死
And he was poison. Cats who ate him died.

701
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,500
你来圣路易斯后
This bird is not the only thing

702
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,650
认错的可不只有这只鸟
you've misidentified since you've been in St. Louis.

703
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,130
你和沃克是老朋友了
You and Walker are old friends.

704
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,860
他不是让我来审查你的
I wasn't sent here to vet you.

705
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,770
很好
Very good.

706
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,990
那告诉我来的原因
Tell me why I am here, then.

707
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,730
我好审查你
So I can vet you.

708
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,590
为副总统的职位吗
For the vice presidency?

709
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:46,590
总统很看重我的意见  而且一般会照做
The President values my advice, and he tends to follow it.

710
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,960
比如我建议他不要让你当国务卿那次
Like when I advised him not to make you Secretary of State.

711
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,730
那建议很糟糕
That was very bad advice.

712
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,970
是的
Yes, it was.

713
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,910
是我犯下的最大错误之一
One of the larger mistakes I've made,

714
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,660
而我几乎不犯错
and I very rarely make mistakes of any size.

715
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,860
你真是个相当难搞的人物
You've proven yourself to be quite difficult.

716
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,210
科恩  教师罢工  现在是马修斯
Kern, the teachers' strike, now Matthews.

717
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,200
你觉得这都是我干的
You attribute all that to me?

718
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,490
如果要我猜的话
If I had to guess.

719
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,120
一位智者曾对我说
A smart man once said to me

720
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,980
推测不是一种好的政治手段
that speculation is a poor form of politics.

721
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,000
你还是说你知道的事吧  雷蒙德
Why don't you stick to what you know, Raymond?

722
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,900
我知道  如果你打定了主意
What I know is you are extremely effective

723
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,480
会非常有成效
at what you set your mind to.

724
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,370
这对我很有价值
That is valuable to me,

725
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:39,470
我也跟加勒特说  这对他可能也很有价值
and I've already told Garrett that it could be valuable to him...

726
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,330
选个同时涉足行政部门和立法部门
somebody at his side with one foot in the executive branch

727
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,170
又支持他的人
and one in the legislative.

728
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,800
他很愿意考虑
He is very open to the idea.

729
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,130
该我推测了
My turn to speculate.

730
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,070
你的推荐
Your recommendation...

731
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,700
是有代价的
comes at a price.

732
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,880
事实
Fact.

733
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,170
我有你想要的东西
I have something that you want.

734
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,360
你有我想要的东西
You have something that I want.

735
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,850
我说什么可笑的话了吗
Have I said something amusing?

736
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,800
只是我曾太多次跟别人说过这种话
Oh, I've just sat too many times on your side of the table

737
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,510
不禁觉得自己会听到这种话无比的讽刺
not to enjoy the irony of finding myself on this side of it.

738
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,530
你想听听我想要什么吗
Would you like to hear what I want?

739
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,890
我不把自己绑在我不认识的人身上
I don't shackle myself to people I don't know.

740
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,880
我想让你帮个忙
What I want is one favor.

741
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,150
只有这一个要求
One and only one.

742
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,600
什么忙
Which is?

743
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,260
我要确定你会答应
I need to be certain you'll grant it

744
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,290
才能说得更细
before I'll take the risk of being more specific.

745
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,960
一张空头支票
A blank check.

746
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,460
差不多
Of sorts.

747
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,480
你不会给任何人开空头支票
You would never grant anyone a blank check.

748
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,750
不  但面临抉择的不是我
No. But I'm not sitting on that side of the table.

749
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,870
在我们那地方  还相信握手为诺
We still believe in handshakes where I come from.

750
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,800
华盛顿的人还相信吗
Do they still mean anything in Washington?

751
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,080
-你给谁打电话  -叫出租车载我去机场
- Who are you calling? - Car service to get me to the airport.

752
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,200
弗兰克
Frank,

753
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,730
我会告诉总统我要仔细考虑
I will tell the President that I want until Friday

754
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,440
到周五才能给出我的建议
to think things over before I make my recommendation.

755
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,200
改主意的话告诉我
Let me know if you change your mind.

756
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,950
我给你安排车吧
And let me arrange the car for you.

757
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,420
你好  我想叫一辆车  谢谢
Hi. I'd like to arrange a car, please.

758
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,700
-你感觉怎么样  -比昨天好些
- How are you feeling? - Better than yesterday.

759
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,910
如果又恶心了  可能还得提前走
But I might take off early if, uh, the nausea comes back.

760
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:27,830
你赶走了桑科公司的人
I find it interesting that you stay home

761
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,460
第二天就待在了家里  这很有趣
the day after you blow off the sancorp people.

762
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,530
你不是觉得难受  吉莉安
You weren't feeling sick, Gillian.

763
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,220
我觉得你指责我
I find it extremely offensive

764
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,280
用怀孕作为逃避的理由很无礼
that you'd accuse me of hiding behind my pregnancy.

765
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,350
你很清楚我的意思
You knew what I wanted.

766
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,050
博茨瓦纳项目是我的
The Botswana project is mine.

767
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,760
在我的保护下  用我筹集的钱
Under my umbrella, using money I raised.

768
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,430
你答应给我自主权
You promised me autonomy.

769
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,880
让我们单独待会儿  谢谢
Um, excuse us for a moment, please.

770
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,380
我答应给你权力
I promised to empower you.

771
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,210
这和你不问我
That's not the same thing

772
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,410
就自作主张是两码事
as you doing  as you choose without consulting me.

773
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,090
我不会让一个我投入了三年心血
I'm not gonna allow a project I've put almost three years

774
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,310
-的项目  -如果没有桑科
- of my life into... - your project wouldn't be happening

775
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:09,020
你的项目根本不可能实现
if it weren't for sancorp.

776
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,770
我没要他们帮忙
I didn't ask for their help.

777
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,110
你达成协议之前怎么不和我商量
How about consulting me before you struck a deal?

778
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,950
我们把话说清楚
Let's get something very clear.

779
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,980
我运营这个组织  你为它工作
I run the organization. You work for it.

780
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,640
我们的协议是联盟  克莱尔
Our agreement is an affiliation, Claire.

781
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,290
-世界之井不是你的下人  -是  它就是
- Worldwell isn't your vassal. - Yes, it is, entirely,

782
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,690
如果非要直说的话
if we're going to be blunt about it.

783
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,420
这不是你六个月前的提议
That's not what you proposed six months ago.

784
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,780
你签合同的时候就等于接受了这一切
It's what you signed up for when you signed the contract.

785
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,790
我们的协议有一份诚意...
There was a good faith understanding that...

786
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,270
你对我的违抗  让我失去了这份诚意
And you dissolved that good faith by disobeying me.

787
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,700
-违抗你  -是的
- Disobeying you? - Yes.

788
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,080
我威胁到你了  是吧
I threaten you, don't I?

789
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,770
你没有什么能威胁到我
Nothing about you threatens me.

790
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,970
也许你应该去休假
But maybe you should take a leave of absence.

791
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,960
你要开除我
Are you firing me?

792
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,490
这取决于你  但现在你得离开
That's up to you, but right now you should leave.

793
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,900
她愿意公开吗
Did you get her on record?

794
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,920
不  否则她就不和我说话了
No. She wouldn't talk to me otherwise.

795
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,900
我们需要确凿证据证明安德伍德是幕后黑手
We need hard proof that Underwood was behind it.

796
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,420
这事让我很紧张
This whole thing is making me really nervous.

797
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,800
害怕你会暴露
That you'll be exposed?

798
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,420
不是
Not that.

799
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,110
那可是弗兰西斯
It's Francis.

800
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,680
如果这事真像我们想的那么大
If this really goes as deep as we think,

801
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,100
他已经在监视你
and he's already watching you...

802
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,680
-你认为他很危险  -我知道他很危险
- You think he's dangerous? - I know he is.

803
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,930
所以我们必须得查下去
Then that's why we have to keep going.

804
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,590
他能毁掉一个人
He crushes people...

805
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,380
-你好  卡拉姆  -你好
- Hey, Callum. - Hey.

806
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,590
如果你不怕  就不会做这份工作了
Look, if you weren't afraid, you wouldn't be doing your job.

807
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,420
我写过的唯一一篇
The only articles that I have ever written

808
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,510
真正重要的文章简直把我吓坏了
that truly mattered scared the shit out of me.

809
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,720
我们得了解关于罗素的一切
We need to know about anything that might've happened with Russo.

810
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,150
安德伍德用来威胁他的事
Something Underwood could have held over him.

811
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,210
咱们得再去找克里斯蒂娜・盖拉格
We have to go back to Christina Gallagher,

812
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,460
看她能说点什么
see if she'll give us something.

813
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,990
我不能去了  如果我又去找
It can't be me. If I go back for a second time...

814
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:03,910
我去吧
I'll do it.

815
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,730
你完全不知道总统和塔斯克关系很亲密吗
You honestly had no idea that the President and Tusk were close?

816
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,690
从我们开始竞选到上任这段时间内
He never showed up once on any call sheet,

817
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,320
他从没出现在任何通告单
phone log or schedule during

818
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,530
通话记录或者日程表上
the campaign or since we've been in office.

819
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,450
我很想相信你  琳达
I'd love to believe you, Linda,

820
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,240
但这很困难
but I'm finding it very difficult.

821
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,200
我把你蒙在鼓里有什么好处呢
What would I gain by keeping you in the dark?

822
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,730
我跟你一样震惊  弗兰克
I am as shocked as you are, Frank.

823
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,230
别让他看出来你知道了
Well, don't let on that you know.

824
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,740
-当然  -总统说什么
- Of course not. - What's the President saying?

825
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,440
他周二想见你  让你报告塔斯克的事
He wants to meet with you Tuesday to get your report on Tusk.

826
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,430
真是胡闹
That's a farce.

827
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,620
要我找点理由推迟会面吗
Should I come up with a reason to delay the meeting?

828
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,920
不用了  或许能打探出点什么
No. Maybe we'll learn something.

829
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,460
-什么时候  -下午两点
- What time? - 2:00 P.M.

830
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,300
好吧  我会去的  谢谢你  琳达
All right. I'll be there. Thank you, Linda.

831
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:40,040
-我们有一礼拜时间  -做什么
- We have one week. - To accomplish what exactly?

832
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,180
逼迫塔斯克  他想让我感激他  休想
To force Tusk's hand. He wants me beholden to him? No.

833
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,470
我们得让他来找我
We have to make him come crawling to me.

834
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,420
他的弱点是什么
What's his weakness?

835
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,840
他的财产
His fortune.

836
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,610
那不是他的优势吗
Wouldn't you say that's his strength?

837
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,190
一旦流失就不是了
Not if it's slipping away.

838
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,530
-怎么在一夜之间搞掉四百亿  -做不到
- How do you make 40 billion disappear overnight? - We can't.

839
00:47:57,530 --> 00:47:59,910
但可以制造出他的财产有危险的假象
But maybe we can create the illusion that it's in danger.

840
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,820
你给我的那份他的资产报告
The brief you gave me on his assets.

841
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,410
他的总资产净值有多少
How much of his total net worth is...

842
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,300
是核能方面的
in nuclear power?

843
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,260
大概是三分之一
About a third.

844
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,020
美国有16个反应堆  全球37个
Sixteen reactors here in the states, 37 worldwide.

845
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,470
那就是我们打击他的武器
Well, that's what we hit him with.

846
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,260
我们要打击他的核利益
We go after his nuclear interests.

847
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,190
即便如此
Even so,

848
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,840
他的其他投资价值250亿美金
he's got 25 billion in other investments.

849
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,480
道格  他白手起家
Doug, this is a man who built his fortune from nothing.

850
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,050
钱对他毫无意义
The money doesn't mean anything to him.

851
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,610
重在钱所代表的东西
It's what it represents.

852
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,980
-是什么  -他一生的努力
- Which is what? - His life's work.

853
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,030
接通雷米・丹顿的电话
Get Remy Danton on the phone.

854
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,470
尽快安排一个会面
Set up a meeting as quickly as you can.

855
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,450
知道了
You got it.

856
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,290
塔斯克理解权力和金钱之间的区别
Tusk understands the difference between power and money.

857
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,300
因此他是个危险人物
That's precisely what makes him dangerous.

858
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,410
他衡量财富的标准不是私人飞机
He doesn't measure his wealth in private jets

859
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,460
而是拉拢的人心
but purchased souls.

860
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,850
我做了这么多努力  如今目标近在咫尺
I've worked too hard to get within arm's reach of the prize

861
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,430
绝不能在即将到手时被砍断双手
only to have my hand cut off just before I seize it.

862
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,960
佐伊・巴恩斯  来见克里斯蒂娜・盖拉格
Zoe Barnes, here to see Christina Gallagher.

863
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,640
抱歉  我没看到有预约
I'm sorry. I don't see an appointment.

864
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,780
肯定搞错了  我预约了11点半的
Oh, there must be a mistake. I have an 11:30.

865
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,780
稍等一下
One second.

866
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,480
我叫佐伊・巴恩斯
My name is Zoe Barnes.

867
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,820
我在头条网工作
I work at Slugline.

868
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,500
你跟我同事简宁・斯克斯基谈过了
You spoke to my colleague Janine Skorsky.

869
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,670
-小姐  -没事  谢谢
- Miss... - Oh, we're fine, thanks.

870
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,590
你不能这么闯进来
You can't just come in here...

871
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,580
很多关于彼得的事你都不知道
There are things you don't know about Peter.

872
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,620
关于罗伊・科佩尼科的文章是我写的
I wrote the article about Roy Kapeniak.

873
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,400
请快走吧  马上
Please leave. Right now.

874
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,600
是彼得说服他跟我谈的
It was Peter who convinced him to talk to me.

875
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,040
什么  我不  不明白
What? I don't... I don't understand.

876
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,710
-他为什么  -有人强迫他做的
- Why would he... - Somebody pressured him to do it.

877
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,140
1月24号晚上
The night of January 24th.

878
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,150
他去找科佩尼科
That's when he went to speak to Kapeniak.

879
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,760
你记得就职典礼左右
Do you remember anything strange

880
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,530
发生过什么奇怪的事吗
around the time of the inauguration?

881
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,620
-任何可能成为把柄的事  -没有
- Anything that could have been held over him? - No, I don't.

882
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,420
如果他被牵连进了
If he was mixed up in things

883
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,830
最终导致他自杀的事情
that in any way contributed to his suicide,

884
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,120
你不想知道吗
