我能够

219

你不明白我在这个省
You're unaware of the influence

220
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,300

你不了解这些人

223

所有阻碍他的人
Anyone who stood in his way.

231
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,900
人们说他不可阻挡 但是现在

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,500
勒齐在监狱里 而我控制着这里

我决定着生杀大权 现在你的命在我手中

235
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,300
我就在策划越狱
I've been planning my escape.

要从牢笼出来 你别无选择

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
派直升机来的人
The people who sent the helicopters,

240
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,290
他们和陷害我哥哥
They're the same people

241
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,600
的是同一伙人
Who framed my brother

242
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200

如果我开口 我可能会危及他的安全

252

如果你说的是实情

也是我唯一能够透露的了

-你不该继续干那事的 -我明白了 好吗?

玛丽克鲁兹没有保险 好吗?

听着 我刚才看到迈克了

-他现在被单独囚禁 -什么?
He's in solitary confinement. what?

277
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,380
他们把他塞到广场中央的笼子里
They put him in a box out in the middle of the yard,

278
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,570
让他自生自灭
All by himself.

279
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,850
我无能为力
He can't do anything.

280
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,890
事情会好转的
It's going to be okay.

281
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,010
只会更糟
It's not going to be okay.

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,790
我不知道该如何是好
I don't know what to do, man.

283
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,360
事情已经乱套了
Everything's just fallen apart.

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,130
你在看什么?

风景

286
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,440

I can't help but notice

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,970
你和勒齐成了朋友
You and Lechero made friends.

288
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,320
他最近跟很多白种人
He's been hanging out

00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,900
混在一起
With a lot of white boylately.

290
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,260
-有问题吗? -没有 但是萨米有
Got a problem with that? no. but Sammy does.

291
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,010
听着 我最近仔细观察
See, I've been looking close,

292
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,000
就像一直以来一样
Like I always do.

293
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,040
而且我知道你们会很高兴
And I know you all would be a lot better off

294
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,150
如果萨米可以消失
If Sammy were no longer around.

295
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:54,880
那就不用去担心
Wouldn't have to worry

296
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,760
他敏锐的嗅觉坏了你们的好事
About his snout poking in your business.

297
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,410
那么你的建议是?
And you're suggesting ?

298
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,810
你我都明白 这事势在必行
You and I both know it needs to happen

299
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,990
索纳中没有多少人愿意冒险除掉萨米
There aren't many men in Sona who would take out Sammy.

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,830
我心中有个合适人选
I have one particular man in mind.

301
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,450
他欠我的
A man who owes me.

302
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,660
但是事成之后 我要求入伙
But if I pull through, I'm in the club, guaranteed.

303
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,930
你等着瞧好了
You're gonna see to it.

304
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,150
好吧 走着瞧
All right.

305
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,740
我想这笔交易你能做主
I assume you have the power to make this deal.

306
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,490
没错
I do.

307
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,640
成交
Agreed.

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,720
好了

那么

谢谢了
Thank you, sir.

311
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,220
听着 你跟我说的我想了很久
Look, I've been thinking about what you told me and, uh 

312
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,620
但是我不能放弃这份工作
But I can't quit my job.

313
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,800
随你便吧
Do whatever you want to do.

314

你居然为友谊收费?
You're gonna start charging me now for your friendship?

321

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,260
那个囚犯
This inmate.

331
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,730
就是你想帮他越狱的家伙
The one who you've been sent to free.

332
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,020
他会来证实你跟我说的一切
He should be able to verify what you've told me.

333
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,300
他确实可以 但是我不知道他是否愿意

告诉我他的名字

你为何不告诉我?
Why don't you tell me?

342
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,090

那间寓所
That apartment,

都是为我们准备的
It's all for us.

350
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,870
当我离开这鬼地方后
It's how we're gonna get away.

351
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,900
这些都是为我们准备的后路
When I get out of this place,

352
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,860
我会找个可以长相思守的方式工作
I'll be working on a way for us to be together.

353
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,010
还记得我们一直说起的法国吗?

詹姆斯 你让我怎么相信你?
James, how how can I believe you?

358
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,990
我怎么再相信任何事情?
How can I believe anything anymore?

359
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,180
惠斯勒
Whistler.

360
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,650
只要知道

361
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,440
知道我爱你就行

你即将面临一些严厉的指控

366
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,910

367
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,500
你对此一无所知?
You know nothing about this?

368
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,780
不知道
No.

369
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,220
斯科菲尔德是个聪明人 不过
Scofield's a smart man but, uh,

370
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,890
他有狂想症
He's got a rabid imagination.

371
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,280
所以你是想说他在撒谎?
So you're calling him a liar?

372
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,360

我有能力去验证整件事的真假

外头是谁在负责?
Who's in charge on the outside?

如果你现在开口的话 这事就算结了
We can end this right now if you can provide it.

379
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,620
不知道你什么意思?

没给你带好货来
Without my bag of goodies.

387
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,950
我很担心你会一走了之 再不回来
I was afraid you were gone for good.

388
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,350
少了你 这戏就不精彩了

现在 你准备好 在角斗场打败他

作为回报
In exchange,

403
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,190
愿意告诉我真相

你和斯科菲尔德合谋的吗?
Are you working with Scofield?

405
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,120
你和斯科菲尔德合谋的吗?

但是再也没有第三人卷入了
But there's no one else involved.

408
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,150
俗话说得好 真相终将
As they say in america, we're gonna get this story

409
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,710
大白于世

他什么也没有招供
He's confirmed nothing 

414

问问那个一直和他碰面的女人的事
Ask him about that woman he's been meeting with.

415
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,990
并非如你所想那样

416
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,780
我怎想无所谓 要紧的是你知道什么

迈克 这么做就是自杀
Michael, this is suicide 

423

他们会杀了索菲亚

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,660
-也会杀了你侄子 -这个人

可以帮助我们 但是没有名字

426
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,690
他什么也办不到 快说出来吧

427
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,680
詹姆斯

一切都结束了
It's over.

430
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,520
格雷琴・摩根

我只想和你聊聊

我听说你和林肯的协议了
I heard about your argument with Lincoln.

445
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,040
你的人真是无处不在呀

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,690
现在 你比我更了解他
Now, you know him better

447
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,410
但根据我的经验
Than I do, but from personal experience,

那家伙总是说一套做一套
That man does not like to be told wt to do.

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,220
他喜欢指挥周围的每一个人
He sure likes bossing everyone else around.

451
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,700
你也该为自己
You have to start looking out

452
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,190
打算打算了 费尔南多
For yourself, Fernando.

00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,960
你该回去向他道歉
All you have to do is go back, apologize,

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,060
告诉他你会为了自由继续跟进

我会电话你 咱俩再来喝一杯

但我不会要求你做任何事

463
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,360
从长远看这没什么好处

464
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,630
我不知道这会有什么帮助
i don't see how this is helping.

465
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,420
林肯制造了许多麻烦
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.

他需要改变下做事的方法
He needs to get out of his own way, and I think

467

我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea who you're talking about.

我今天没时间看它
I didn't get around to it today.

651
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,100
你需要做个选择
You need to make a choice.

652
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
勒齐大限在即
Lecho's days are numbered.

00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,430
他们被带到这儿问话
They were here for questioning

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,200
好吧

662

咱们走
Let's go.

663
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,900
监狱总管怎么了

早上监狱总管死在在2号高速公路上

665
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,800

666
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,000
节哀顺变
I'm sorry to hear that.

你要想出去就给我电话用用

670
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,300
到里面去打

671
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,890

LJ怎么样?

673
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,590
他很好

674
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,300
你知道吗 苏珊怒了
You know what? Susan's not.

675
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,100
他很好? 你确定吗?
He's fine? are you sure?

676
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,700
确定 我刚刚跟他通了电话
Yeah. I just got off the phone with him.

677
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,700
你干吗不告诉我事情的进展
Why didn't you tell me what was going on?

678
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,100
你的计划差点害死他
He could have died because of what you did.

679
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,400
惠斯勒还在我们手上
We've still got Whistler.

680
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,300
到目前为止我们很好
As long as we do, we're okay.

681
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,100
我得走了
I got to go.

682
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,700
看见布兰克了吗?
Hey, did you see Blanco?

683
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,500
他在这里走来走去像是老大
He's walking around like the landlord.

684
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,890
我想你说过勒齐会照看这里
I thought you said Lechero was going to take care of it?

685
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,600
他会的
He will.

686
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,300
他说过这话很久了
How long has he been saying that?

687
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,590
如果你和勒齐还想像以前那样
Look if you and Lechero want to go around

688
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,200
作威作福 那就试试看
Like an old married couple, fighting this way or that 

689
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,890
也许你要在厨房里
Maybe you li it in the kitchen.

690
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,290
你小心点
Hey, you be careful.

691
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,700
做点什么吧
Then do something 

692
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,890
否则你知道会有什么结果
Or the next thing you know,

693
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,100
你只是斯科菲尔德的一颗棋子
You're gonna be taking orders from Scofield.

694
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,600
有人什么都不想做了
Some people stop at nothing, huh?

695
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
是的
Uh 

696
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,900
无论如何
Yeah. whatever.

697
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,700
至少我们回来了
At least we're back inside.

698
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,290
你想要什么已经显而易见了
Which of course is exactly what you wanted.

699
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,000
是吗?
Isn't it?

700
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,890
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

701
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,500
你是在引狼入室
You let the fox into the henhouse.

702
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,200
你放弃格雷琴只有一个原因
The only reason you gave up Gretchen's name

703
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,090
所以她会卷土重来把你带出去
Was so she could come in and pull you out of the fire.

704
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
你想要我放弃她
You wanted me to give up her name.

705
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,000
你知道不会就这样结束的
You know it doesn't end with her.

706
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,600
我懂
Yeah, I do.

707
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,700
问题在于你怎么办?
The qutions how do you?

708
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,590
一个新来的怎么可能
How does a simple fisherman seem to know

709
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,300
知道这么多关于公司的事情
So much about the company?

710
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,700
当她回来的时候 她会
When she comes back, and she will

711
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,900
我该说什么
 what am I gonna say?

712
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,400
你想不想这样做?
You gonna do this or not?

713
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,200
你可以给她肯定的答复
You can tell her the answer is yes.

714
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,040
不过一旦我们出去了
But once we're out, I consider

715
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,250
所谓人质
You collateral 

716
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:52,810
就没有任何意义了
Nothing more.
