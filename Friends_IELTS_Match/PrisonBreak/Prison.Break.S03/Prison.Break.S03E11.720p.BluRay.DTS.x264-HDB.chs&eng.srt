00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,050
她为什么呆在车里?

地道应该把我们送去禁入区
The tunnel get us into no mans land,

但却有栅栏 我们需要改道避开塔卫

什么时候
What time?

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,430
最好还是白天行动
Daytime's still our best option.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,740
晚上他们会加强防卫
They double the guards at night.

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,770
还有吉普车巡逻?
And the jeep patrols?

51
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,330
是的 呃 还有些别的
Yeah. and, uh there's something else.

知道么? 跟他们无关
You know what? it's not about them.

56
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,580
关键是惠斯勒 我们得尽一切办法 
It's about Whistler. we got to do whatever 

57
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,970
你不必知道惠斯勒究竟是什么人
You don't need to know who Whistler is.

58
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,690
那他有多大价值你知道吧 我儿子的命
What about what he's worth? my son's life.

59
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,180
惠斯勒并不是解决问题的办法
I justish there was another way to do this.

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,250
要救出lj 但不能把惠斯勒交给他们
To save lj without handing Whistler over.

61
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,400
听着 我们没的选择
Look, man, that's it. there isn't.

62
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,850
我知道

-明天见 -明天见
See you tomorrow. tomorrow.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,490
那些柱子 就尽量用吧
Hey, now, don't skimp on the braces up there.

67
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,730
如果还要的话 就只管 
In fact, if you want to add a little extra, just 

68
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,030
这活要干到什么时候啊
You know, we can work on this railroad all 

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,860
不过没关系
The livelong day, but it don't matter

70
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,830
反正斯科菲尔德不知道出去后会怎么个情况
If Scofield doesn't know what happens once

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,100
一旦我们出去
We get off the train. once we get

72
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,050
大家就各顾各的
Out of here, it's every man for himself.

73
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,320
斯科菲尔德不用对我们任何人负责
Scofield's not responsible for any of us.

74
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,550
是吗?
Is that so?

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
显然你还不了解他
You obviously don't know him very well,

76
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,240
大老粗
Shakespeare.

77
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,520
当我们从福克斯河逃出来后
When we broke out of fox river,

78
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,820
他想把我们都给毁了
He tried to screw every one of us.

79
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,330
有一半的人
Half the men ended up either

80

要么被杀 要么被抓 或者更糟
Dead, captured or worse.

81
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,940
最容易被逮到的人
The guys who are easiest to catch

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,550
就是那些四处惹事或者整天哀叹
Are the one's who spend more time

83
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,420
而不赶紧逃跑的人
Pissing and moaning at each other than running.

84
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,090
给你的唯一建议是
My only advice to you,

85
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,770
传道书第六章13节
Ecclesiastes 6:13.

86
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,910
不要使你自己和你的敌人混在一起
"separate thyself from thy enemies,

87
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,410
多注意下你的朋友
And take heed of thy friends."

88
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,650
干的怎样了 阿历克斯?
How we doing, Alex?

89
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,410
如果那些柱子能撑的住的话
Well, if those braces hold,

90
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,960
明天的某个时候
We could be to the surface

91
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,930
我们就能到上面了
Sometime tomorrow.

92
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,410
都动动 大家都要保持清醒
Let's rotate. keep everybody fresh.

93
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,590
欢迎进入矿坑 小白脸
Welcome to the coal mine, canary.

94
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,690
浇什么水啊
Drop what?

95
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,080
别老让你的汗滴到我身上
Don't drop your body-water upon me like that 

96
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,240
不是我的汗 我发誓
Hey, it ain't coming from me, I swear.

97
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,700
工程师 过来
Engineer, come.

98
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,520
你看看
Look at this.

99
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,550
是碰到水管了还是怎么的?
We hit a pipe or something?

100
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,910
哦 不妙
Oh, no.

101
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,250
那正好是我们隧道的上方
That's right above our tunnel.

102
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,560
撑不到明天了
That's not going to hold till tomorrow.

103
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,050
该怎么办?
So what do we do?

104
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,700
今晚就走
We leave tonight.

105
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,980
今晚?
Tonight?

106
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,140
你不是说过晚上不可能成功
I thought you said a nighttime escape was impossible.

107
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,250
如果继续下雨 隧道又会坍塌
If the rain keeps up, the tunnel will collapse again,

108
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,900
到时就前功尽弃了
And that'll be the end of it.

109
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,400
你就死定了
It'll be the end for you.

110
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,860
时间不多的人是你
You're the one on a deadline.

111
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,370
那万一在我们出去的时候坍塌呢?
What if it gives out whilwe're inside?

112
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,140
我们岂不是都被活埋了
We end up like buried treasure.

113
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,810
要不想去 那就滚
You want out, get out 

114
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,870
听着 要是没有大家齐心协力
Look, you're not pulling this off tonight

115
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,800
你今晚也出不去
Without all of us working around the clock.

116
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,140
同样的 没有他的计划
And none of us

117
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,510
我们大家也都出不去
Are ever making it out of here

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
所以 如果你能够
Without his plan, so if you tell me

119
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,550
想出一个今晚出去的办法
That you can figure out a way how to do this at night,

120
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,750
那么我们都会和你一起努力
Then i we can figure out a way

121
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,670
想办法及时挖好隧道
How to get that tunnel dug in time.

122
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,320
开始挖吧
Let's start digging.

123
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,090
你是不是掉了东西
I think you dropped something.

124
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,580
我在旧报纸上读到了
I've read in old newspapers that make it to sona

125
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,940
美国人是如何要别人去遵守自己所丢弃的标准
How americans hold others to standards they ignore.

126
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,280
美国人认为别人都不该有权力 除了他们自己
How they think no one should have power but them.

127
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,150
我告诉别人 这不是真的 但其实就是真的
I tell everyone it's a lie, but I see it's true.

128
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,970
我知道你要走了
I know you're leaving.

129
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,750
那我想 我为你做了那么多
And I think that after everything I've done to help,

130
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,150
你居然不带上我 你太无耻了
I think it sucks you're not taking me with you 

131
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,190
我知道你现在不明白
I know it doesn't seem like it now,

132
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,630
但其实我是在帮你 送了你一份大礼
But I'm doing you a favor. I'm giving you a gift.

133
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,750
让我继续呆在大牢 是吧
Oh, wow, life in prison.

134
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,680
谢谢了 真是得偿所愿啊
Thank you. I've always wanted one of those.

135
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,100
这比四处逃亡要好
It's better than a life on the run.

136
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,000
我不属于这 我只不过 
I don't belong here. all I did was give a guy 

137
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,700
你留在这 
You're not going 

138
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,430
为了你好
It's for the best.

140
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,140
你怎么知道这是为了我好?
How do you know what's best for me?

141
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,080
都办好了?
Y cuanto me va costar?

142
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,580

你知道时间和地点 是吧?
You know where and when to be, right?

145
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,060
如果你不准时出现 我们就玩完了
If you're not there, we're screwed.

146
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,210
你没事吧?

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,620
是啊 或许对你和詹姆斯来说 消失是最好的了
Yeah. probably best if you and James disappear.

150

Playa blanca. you'll be on the 

153
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,220
3-12
3-12.

154
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,230
3-12 那明天见
3-12. we'll see you tomorrow then.

155
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,930
祝你好运
Good luck.

156
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,610
你也是
You, too.

157
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,780
又是苏珊那娘们
Hey, it's that Susan chick.

158
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,500
她又找我了
She wants to meet again.

159
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,480
好的
Good.

160
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,810
告诉她一切正常
Let her know everything's on track.

161
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,440
让她尽可能感到踏实
We want to make her feel as comfortable as possible.

162
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,710
她为何会不踏实?
Why shouldn't she be?

163
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,200
她明天就能得到她要的人了 是吧?
She's going to get her guy tomorrow, right?

164
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,210
是的 只要迈克的良知不惹麻烦的话
Well, if Michael's conscience doesn't get in the way.

165
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,060
什么意思?
What do you mean?

166
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,930
他有顾虑
He's having doubts.

167
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,860
关于是否能够尽快逃走
About if he can pull it off?

168
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,820
如果必要的话
About if he should.

169
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,460
但是他一定可以成功的 是吧?
But he's going to go through with it, right?

170
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,740
你在找什么
What are you looking for?

171
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,340
找给索纳监狱外部的灯供电的电线
Where the power lines connect to Sona's exterior lights.

172
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,010
如果切除电源以后会有逃亡的机会
If cutting the power out there was an option,

173
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,380
为什么我们没有一开始就这样做
Why didn't we do that in the first place?

174
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,710
首先 那里的电源不是这里所能控制的
One, the power out there isn't controlled from in here.

175
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,690
其次 还有那个东西
And, two, there's that.

176
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,950
每个监狱都有一个后备的发电机
Every prison has a backup generator.

177
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,950
就算我们切断了电源 它们还会再亮
Even if we cut the lights, they'll just come back on again

178
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,180
立刻
Immediately.

179
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
好吧 这是一个严肃和残酷的问题
Well, that's a big, bloody problem.

180
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,370
告诉勒齐我需要他的电话
Tell Lechero I need his phone.

181
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,620
计划有变 林肯
Change of plans, Linc.

182
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,120
我们今晚行动
We're doing this tonight.

183
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,730
今晚? 发生了什么事情 迈克
Tonight? what happened, Michael?

184
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,680
雨 泥土 地道 都是问题
Rain, dirt, tunnel, problem.

185
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,980
-地道还能支持多久? -看情况
How long can it hold?

186
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,120
那要看情况了
That depends

187
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,740
看什么情况?
Depends on what?

188
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,210
根据雨停的时间
When the rain stops.

189
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,010
你说过晚上越狱是不可能的
You said breaking out at night was impossible.

190
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,190
是说过 不过 
Yeah, well 

191
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,730
告诉我你想怎么摆平这个问题
You want to tell me how you're going to pull this off?

192
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,230
首先 我需要苏克雷的帮助
For starters, I need to get ahold of Sucre.

193
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,900
苏克雷 你知道我干什么谋生吗
Sucre, do you know what I do for a living?

194
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,590
我有一个好主意
I have a pretty good idea.

195
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,330
我能读懂人
I read people.

196
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,750
而且你 我的朋友 像是一本多彩的书
And you, my friend, are a coloring book.

197
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,600
我觉得
I think you left

198
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,390
你把这个掉到我的车里了
This in my car.

199
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,180
这个只是 我的意思是 
Look. that that was just I mean 

200
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,100
不用解释
No. no, no, no, no.

201
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,990
是我的错
My fault.

202
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,660
我猜我给你布置任务的时候
I guess I just didn't make myself clear

203
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,040
你没有听懂
When I laid out the terms of our arrangement.

204
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,570
所以我现在得再尽可能简洁的讲一次
So I'm going to try again as simply as I know how.

205
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,650
如果有任何事发生 
Anything happens 

206
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,810
只要是我不希望发生的事情 
Anything at all that I wasn't expecting 

207
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,860
那么芝加哥就会少一个
And there will be one less

208
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,350
怀孕的女孩
Pregnant girl in chicago.

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,280
你看 迈克和林肯什么也没告诉我
Look, Michael and Lincoln don't tell me everything.

210
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,150
费尔南多这是你最后一次机会了
Fernando, this is your last chance.

211
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,690
只要你说是或者不是
I want a yes or a no.

212
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,060
那兄弟两人是不是将要把惠斯勒带出索纳
Are the brothers gonna break Whistler out of Sona?

213
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,240
是的
Yes.

214
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,230
而且他们打算把他交给我?
Are they planning on handing him over to me?

215
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,220
是的
Yes.

216
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,360
你希望我先打中玛丽克鲁兹哪个部位?
Where do you want me to shoot Maricruz first,

217
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,120
打后脑还是臀部?
In the bun or in the oven?

218
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,550
好吧 
Okay 

219
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,690
我听说一件事情
There's one thing I heard.

220
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,960
是关于迈克的事情 他对 惠斯勒有些担心
It's Michael. he's, he's having some concerns about Whistler.

221
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,930
担心他什么?
What kind of concerns?

222
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,550
关于把他交给你的事情
About handing him over.

223
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,870
你得知道
You got to understand,

224
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,230
上次他越狱带出了一群坏蛋
He broke out some pretty bad guys last time.

225
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,150
我想他自今都没有原谅自己
I think he's never forgiven himself for that.

226
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,110
他打算把惠斯勒留下?
He's planning on leaving him behind?

227
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,680
可能吧 我不知道
Maybe. I don't know.

228
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,010
嘘 
Shh.

229
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,440
你好 林肯
Hello, Lincoln.

230
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,680
今晚就要行动了
It's going down tonight.

231
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,820
今晚?
Tonight?

232
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,920
我应该担心吗
Should I be worried?

233
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,200
我一收到消息就打给你了
I called you first thing.

234
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,950
我说的全是真的
I'm being straight up with you.

235
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,100
这真是令人高兴
That's refreshing.

236
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,340
那晚上见
So I'll see you tonight.

237
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,150
你对我坦诚 我也会坦诚待你

今晚就要行动了

239
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,040
你知道吗
Do you know about that?

240
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,110
我发誓我不知道
I didn't know, I swear.

241
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,230
滚出去
Get out of here.

242
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,570
怎么样了?
How'd it go?

243
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,040
她找到那个炸弹了 林肯
She found the bomb, Linc.

244
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,820
那个我们丢在她车里的
The one we put in her car.

245
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,810
她怎么找到的 苏克雷
How did she find the bomb, Sucre?

246
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,800
我不知道 兄弟 对不起
I don't know, bro. I'm sorry.

247
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,370
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

248
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,570
今后我会补偿的
Look, I'llak mit

249
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,910
我发誓
Up to you, I swear.

250
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,300
你可以开始了
You can start now.

251
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,230
迈克在索纳遇到一点麻烦
Michael's in a bit of trouble in Sona.

252
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,280
什么样的麻烦?
What kind of trouble?

253
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,040
雨停了 这是不是意味着 ?
The rain stopped. does that mean ?

254
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,530
不行 已经对隧道造成了损坏
No. the damage is done.

255
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,500
我们不能冒险等着
We can't risk waiting.

256
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,330
有什么有趣的事情吗
Anything interesting?

257
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,280
比如一些公司想要染指的
Like some coordinates

258
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,330
坐标
The company might want to get their hands on?

259
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,990
如果他们不想让我出去
If they didn't want me out of here

260
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,940
而且你的侄儿是安全的 你还会这样做吗?
And yourephew was safe, would you still be doing this?

261
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,380
越狱?
Breaking out?

262
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,270
不会
No.

263
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,600
为什么在有机会自由的时候你仍选择留下呢
Why would you choose to stay if there was a chance at freedom?

264
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,280
我认为这就是我们之间的区别
Well, I guess that's the difference between us.

265
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,700
我愿意偿还我犯下的罪
I'm willing to pay for my sins.

266
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,590
你认为我不愿意?
And I'm not?

267
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,590
这是个不错的问题
That's a good question.

268
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,030
水进来的很快 同志
Water's coming down pretty fast up in here, patron.

269
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,750
是啊 我们必须得快点挖
Yeah. we hav to dig faster.

270
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,330
我一直在想
You know, I've been thinking.

271
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,580
我们都不应该各为自己
It doesn't have to be every man for himself.

272
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,550
你和我可以互相帮助
You and I can help each other.

273
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,870
我更愿意找有2个手的助手
If I need a hand, I'll find someone with a spare.

274
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,210
好吧 我确实
While it's true I may be lacking

275
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,310
在某一方面少些东西
Something inhe west,

276
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
不过我会在另一方面弥补
I more than make up for it in the north.

277
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,050
考虑一下吧
Think about it.

278
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,860
斯科菲尔德让我们到这里来做苦力 奴工
Scofield's got us down here doing manual labor; slave labor.

279
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,820
我不是奴工
I ain't no slave.

280
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,540
我是为自己做的
I'm doing this for me.

281
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,400
你觉得 斯科菲尔德在上面干什么
Why do you think Scofield's up there

282
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,110
在我们做这些的时候
And we'rdoe here?

283
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
他正在计划一些事情
He's planning something.

284
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,030
我们中间谁没有自己的打算?
Who among us isn't?

285
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,530
那是什么
What the hell is that?

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,030
好吧 我们就卸在这边
Ok, let's unload it here.

287
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,320
帮忙把车推出这块泥潭
Make the animals walk through the filth

288
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,390
过来
Come here.

没事了
We're good.

我们安全了
We are all right.

293
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,720
对
Yeah.

294
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,620
你好 林肯 好久不见
Hello, Lincoln. long time no see.

295
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,950
还没有多久
Not long enough.

296
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,660
我在想
I was thinking that we could

297
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,870
我们可以私下聊聊
Have a little chat in person.

298
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,730
确保我们对于今晚发生的事情
Make sure we're all on the same page

310
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,200
林肯说你需要点帮助
Lincoln said you needed some help.

311
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,710
你对电源了解多少?
How much do you know about electricity?

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,940
嘿 你回来啦
Hey, you're back.

313
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,700
我实在觉得独自在这下面不太舒服
I'm not real comfortable being alone down here with those 

314
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,370
那是什么?
What's that?

315
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,770
掩护 亲爱的 和一些泥浆
Syrup; honey. make a little pile of dirt.

316
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,140
把泥土凝结起来
Gather some dirt.

317
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,310
斯科菲尔德说我们出去以后
Scofield said we got to make

318
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,810
必须找个东西掩盖洞口
Something to cover the hole once we get out.

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,140
当灯光再亮起来的时候
So when the lights go back on

320
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,460
就会象没有人离开过那一样
It's gonna look like nobody ever left.

321
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,760
快干 把泥土和匀
Go ahead. spread it around.

322
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,960
我在想 
I was thinking 

323
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,550
我们应该是一起的 你知道吧?
We should be a team, yoknow?

324
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,220
不只在越狱过程中 以后也是
Not just during the escape, but after.

325
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,230
就像Butch和Sundance(来自一美国电影的好朋友)
Like, like Butch and Sundance.

326
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,250
Butch和Sundance死了
Butch and sundance died.

327
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,190
我的意思是在别的方面类似
Well, I mean in the other parts.

328
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,410
我有个主意
Here's an idea.

329
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,280
我们先按斯科菲尔德的计划做
We go along with Scofield's plan,

330
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,460
然后等大家都停下来
And then when everyone stops

331
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,840
休息时 我们就抓住他们
To take a breath, we grab 'em,

332
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,390
布鲁斯 斯科菲尔德 蒂博格
Burroughs, Scofield, Bagwell.

333
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,040
带他们回去接受指控
We take 'em back home to face charges.

334
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,150
我们就成英雄了
Hell, we'd be heroes.

335
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,480
说不定还能写本书
Might even get a book deal.

336
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,000
阿历克斯 我们可以一起写书
We could write it together, Alex.

337
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,560
-怎么样? -卖书?
How'd that be? a book deal?

338

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,630
你有更好的主意?
You got a better idea?

341
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,820
没错
Yeah, I do.

342
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,550
你是指和老婆孩子一起?
Something to do with a wife and kid?

343
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,110
对 差不多
Yeah, something like that.

344
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,230
还有多余的位置给我吗?
You got room for one more?

345
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,480
快 阿历克斯
Come on, Alex.

346
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,230
像我这样的人会怎么做?
What's a guy like me gonna do?

347
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,840
还是先逃出这里再说吧
Let's just let scofield get us out of here,

348
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,980
然后我们再慢慢盘算这些 好吗
And then we'll worry about everything else, all right?

349
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,110
好
All right.

350
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,850
快 再多一点泥土
Come on. a little more dirt.

351
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,000
仔细听着 按我说的做
Listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.

352
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,840
你确定不想让林肯做这个?
You sure you don't want Linc to do this?

353
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,210
他懂的比我懂的多
He knows more about this than I do.

354
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,530
这不是谁懂的多的问题
It's not about what you know.

355
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,600
而是你在哪工作的问题
It's about where you work.

356
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,430
既然进了索纳工作 朋友
And as a Sona employee, my friend,

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,360
都是狗屎
They mean nothing.

467
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,220
我已经给了充足的时间你们了
I'm pretty sick of waiting around for you boys

468
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,920
充足的让我都要人头不保了
To screw me over.

469
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,860
今天我必须得到这些坐标
I want those coordinates by the end of the day.

470
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,830
不 
No 

471
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,540
必须想个办法
Gotta figure it out.

472
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,770
必须做点什么
Gotta do something.

473
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,520
必须得做点什么了
Gotta do something.

474
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,660
我们都明白你不能就这样把坐标给他们
We both know that you can't just hand over that information.

475
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,710
为什么 为什么不能
Why? why can't i?

476
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,990
一旦他们得到他们想要的
Once they get what they want,

477
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,180
他们就没理由继续留着你了
They'll have no reason to keep you

478
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,840
以及你的女朋友和我的侄子
Or your girlfriend or my nephew alive.

479
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,380
那我要怎么做
So what do I do?

480
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,110
我 我 
I, I just,

481
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,110
难道我就让他们折磨索菲亚
I just let them torture Sofia?

482
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,890
我们会想出办法的
We'll work something out.

483
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,280
我们会搞定的
We'll think it through.

484
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,860
我已经有办法了
I already have.

485
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,190
惠斯勒 
Whistler 

486
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,240
惠斯勒 他到底 
Whistler. what is

487
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,900
有什么特别的
So special about him anyway, huh?

488
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,550
你认为他和那些想让
You think he has anything to do with why them people

489
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,300
斯科菲尔德死的人有什么关系吗
Wanted Scofield down here in the first place?

490
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,060
这不关我鸟事
It's really none of my business.

491
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,880
那什么是关你鸟事的 阿历克斯
What exactly is your business, Alex?

492
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,460
你现在想的
Something on your mind?

493
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,700
我只是说 
I'm just saying 

494
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,100
如果大家要这样讨价还价 互相猜疑
If we needed a bargaining chip,

495
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,820
你认为 
Do you think 

496
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,430
他真的会帮我们逃出去吗
A sharp stick in that dull limey would help us out?

497
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,060
不是我们
There is no"us."

498
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,870
你和我
You and me are a lot more

499
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,480
比你想像的更甚 阿历克斯
Alike than you think, Alex.

500
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,560
我们都知道那是什么感觉
We both know how it feels

501
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,160
失去一个挚爱的人
To lose a great love.

502
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,220
杀死一个人
How it feels to kill a man.

503
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,490
现在 我们都在这里玩完了 都是因为迈克・斯科菲尔德
And we both ended up in here because of Michael Scofield.

504
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,340
这将是个正义的惩罚方式 
Wouldn't it be poetic justice if we could just 

505
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,430
如果我们还给他
Return the favor?

506
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,310
正义?
Justice, huh?

507
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,090
如果这个世界上还有一点点正义的话 
If there was an ounce of it left in this world 

508
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,920
你就会和你家里其他人一样
You'd be lying face down in the same unmarked grave

509
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,500
躺在无名坟墓里
As the restof our inbred family.

510
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:29,210
我们之间唯一的不同 阿历克斯 就是徽章
The only difference between me and you, Alex, is a badge,

511
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,350
而且最后一次我发现 你根本就没有
And the last time I checked, you didn't even have that,

512
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,980
你可以继续期待你的幸福终点 阿历克斯
So you can just keep on hoping for your happy endings, Alex,

513
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,260
你可以继续蒙着眼罩向前
You just keep on plowing ahead with them blinders on,

514
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,710
但是那些眼罩是 
You know, but the thing abouthem blinders is 

515
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,360
很难让你向后看
It makes it really hard to watch your back.

516
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,400
一会儿就好了 我保证
It's gonna be better soon, I promise.

517
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,790
他是对的 如果詹姆斯
He's right, you know. if James loves you

518
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,370
真有他说的那样爱你 他会给我们想要的
The way he says he does, he'll give us what we want,

519
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,880
然后呢 你和你的白马王子
And then you and your white knight

520
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,450
就可以骑马而去了
Can ride off into the sunset.

521
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,150
除非你已经准备好要跟着他了
Unless you're already with him.

522
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,360
你害怕了 苏珊
You scared, Susan?

523
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,590
我看起来害怕了吗 林肯
Do I look scared, Lincoln?

524
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,580
拔出这样的东西 
To pull something like this 

525
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,280
你绝望了?
You desperate?

526
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,930
你最好别跟我作对了
You need to stop fighting with me.

527
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:19,930
如果你真的明白
If you really understood

528
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,220
究竟发生了什么 你就会知道
What was going on, you would know that

529
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,360
我们都不是坏人
We're not the bad guys.

530
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,450
不能耍我
Could've fooled me.

531
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,500
你就没有过
Haven't you ever done

532
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,940
为了一个正确的理由做错事吗
The wrong things for the right reason?

533
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,550
正确的理由是什么 苏珊
What are the right reasons, Susan?

534
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,490
惠斯勒为什么就那么重要
What is it abo Whistler that's so important.

535
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,370
我可以告诉你
I could tell you.

536
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,450
但是然后我就要杀了你
But then I'd have to kill you.

537
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,850
反正你不管怎么样都要那么做的
You're gonna do that anyway.

538
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,930
如果惠斯勒给我们想要的
Whistler gives us what we want,

539
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,920
也许我就不会了
Maybe I won't have to.

540
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,460
林肯来电话了
Linc called.

541
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,550
他们在路上了
They're on their way.

542
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,510
我搞定他们
I figured them out.

543
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,880
坐标
The coordinates.

544
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,200
我来处理
I'm gonna hand them over.

545
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,970
我想你应该知道
I thought you should know

546
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,860
所以你可以做好一切预防
So you can take whatever precautions you can.

547
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,800
如果 
What if, uh 

548
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,940
如果你给他们错的坐标
What if you give them the wrong coordinates.

549
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,080
这就会给我们赢得更多的时间
It might buy us some more time.

550
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,130
林肯就可以带索菲亚安全离开
Maybe Linc can get Sofia to safety.

551
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,620
就像他对莎拉一样
Like he did with Sara?

552
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,560
很抱歉 
I'm sorry. i 

553
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,450
我不是故意的
I didn't mean to.

554
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,790
我 
I, uh 

555
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,730
我只是不知道该做什么
I just don't know what else to do.

556
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,500
我做了不对
I'm damned if I do.

557
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,910
不做也不对
I'm damned if I don't.

558
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,680
不可能赢的
There's way to win.

559
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,860
这不是关于胜负了
It's not about winning anymore.

560
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,160
这是关于生存 
It's about surviving 

561
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,080
如果放弃了
Which is not the same

562
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,040
后果不同
As giving up.

563
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,700
但是你可以温文尔雅的走
But you can go gracefully.

564
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,310
很荣耀
There's honor.

565
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,950
去保护你爱的人
Protecting the ones you love.

566
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,880
荣耀太奢侈了 我们都负担不起
Honor's a luxury men like us can't afford.

567
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,370
你能跟我保证今晚一定会成功吗
Can you promise me we' llmake it out of here tonight?

568
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,730
不耍花样
No games.

569
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,390
你能真诚的跟我保证吗
Can you honestly promise me?

570
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,770
我可以跟你保证我会尽我所能
I can promise you I'll do everything in my power.

571
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,410
我希望那够用
I wish that were good enough.

572
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,080
如果你做了 
If you do this 

573
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,010
如果你给了那些他们想要的 
If you give them what they want 

574
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,570
就统统失败了 我们就什么都不是了
Everything that's been lost

575
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,360
怎么了
what's up?

576
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,270
没事儿的
take it easy

577
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,180
好的
okay

578
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,600
没问题
no problem

579
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,230
是的 我想要找孟赫斯警官 谢谢
yes,i'd like to speak to Officer Monjares,please

580
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,440
孟赫斯 有你的电话
hey Arturo -phone for you

581
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,030
我能跟你说几句话吗
can I talk to you for a minutes

582
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,830
我有点着急
I'm kind of hurry

583
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,110
我要去别的地方
I got some place to be

584
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,220
要去哪里
where's that

585
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,760
我的朋友今晚要走
Friends of mine are moving tonight

586
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,200
他们需要我的帮助
and they need my help

587
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,630
告诉他们你会晚点到
tell them you're gonna be late

588
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,860
我们走吧
Let's go

589
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,590
快走
walk

590
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,760
惠斯勒 有访客
Whistler,you have a visitor

591
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,950
whisler 有访客
whisler,you have a visitor

592
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,970
他要把东西给他们
He's gonna give it to them.

593
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,800
没事儿 我一分钟以后去看你
Relax. I'll see you in a minute.

594
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,140
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

595
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,740
迈克・斯科菲尔德 有访客
Michael Scofield,you have a visitor

596
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,890
迈克・斯科菲尔德 有访客
Michael Scofield,you have a visitor

597
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,890
我猜
I suppose

598
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
现在这个时候自我介绍显得很重要
Introductions are unnecessary at this point.

599
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,440
你在这里干什么 格雷琴
What are we doing here, Gretchen?

600
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,790
我们来这里道别的
We're here to say good-bye.

601
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,510
我保证 亲爱的
I promise you, sweetheart,

602
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,520
他们不会再伤害你了
They're not going to hurt you anymore.

603
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,670
你有没有坐标 詹姆斯
Do you have the coordinates, James?

604
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,270
-有的 -很抱歉
Yes. I'm sorry.

605
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,020
我试着逃跑 
I tried to run away 

606
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,260
这不是你的错
This is not your fault.

607
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,380
是我的错
It's mine.

608
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:02,980
当我找了这个工作
When took this job,

609
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,630
我就知道他们不是好人
I knew they weren't good people.

610
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,910
我只是不知道他们有多坏
I just didn't know how bad they were.

611
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,420
一切都发生了 
And everything that's happened 

612
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,880
都是因为我
It's all because of me.

613
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,140
对此我非常抱歉
And for that I'm truly sorry.

614
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,430
坐标
The coordinates.

615
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,070
你就先忘了这些吧
Just pass them through.

616
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,240
你在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

617
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,360
我在买一些善意
I'm buying some goodwill.

618
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,890
你买了她的葬礼
You're buying her funeral.

619
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,780
你知道我手里有
You know I have

620
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,010
你们想要的 我会给你们剩下的部分
What you need.

621
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,780
然后我会给你剩下的部分
and then I'll give you the rest

622
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,510
但是只能在我了解到

我得把这事和所有牵连的人说清楚
I'm gonna make this clear for everyone involved.

拜托把我们带出去

我办不到 内部是没法搞定的

在日出前挖通隧道
To dig out the tunnel before the sun comes up.

660
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,500
-好吧 那惠斯勒咋办? -怎么说?

他表现的很男人 他本可以

交出坐标了事的 但他没有这么做

林肯 我差不多为每个人都有考虑
I've got my concerns about pretty much everybody, Linc.

考虑后果

我只想快点结束 就在今晚
I just want this to be over tonight.

671
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,760
我们加油干吧
Let's do it.

672
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,110
当你在跑步(注 双关语 也作逃亡)之时
When you're on the run,

673
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,420
你一直盯着自己的肩头看
You're always looking over your shoulder,

674
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,880
听着警报声
Listinenfor the sirens,

675
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,520
彷徨于
Wondering if that

676
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,000
漂亮姑娘是否有盯着你看
Pretty girl across the street is staring at you

677
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,300
因为她需要你

678
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,140
或者就是你被通缉了
Or because you're wanted.

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,000
你改名换姓
You change your name,

改头换面
The way you look 

681
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,860
抛弃过往的一切
And leave everything you ever knew behind.

682
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,560
包括你爱的人
And the ones you love,

683
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,080
他们是你必须回报的人
They're the ones who have to pay.

684
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,160
是他们在外面等着你
That's what's waiting for you on the outside.

685
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,000
这就是我不能带上你的原因
That's why I couldn't bring you on.

686
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,650
因为这一切不会有什么好下场
Because nothing good can come of this.

687
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,490
继续呆下去会有什么好下场?
Can anything good come from staying in?

688
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,940
这需要你自己做决断
It has to be your decision.

689
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,060
我
I 

690
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,960
我不能对你负责
I cannot be responsible for you.

691
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,310
你无需对我负责
You won't have to be.

692
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,970
你爸还保留着上次给你的电话号吗?
Does your father still have that phone number I gave you?

693
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,480
我想是的
I think so.

694
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,770
好吧 让他给我兄弟打电话
Well, tell him to call my brother

695
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,130
如果他想知道明天去哪里接你
If he wants to find out where to pick you up tomorrow.

696
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,720
这就是说 
Does that mean 

697
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,770
就是说如果一切顺利的话 
It means if a million things fall into place 

698
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,770
我明天就能见到我爸爸了
I'm gonna see my father tomorrow.

699
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,350
别让任何人看到你打电话
Don't let anyone see you with that phone.

700
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,830
迈克 我想我们搞定了
I think we did it, Michael.

701
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,050
我相信都准备妥了
I believe we're ready.

702
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,150
洞虽然有点湿 但是可以上了
She's a little wet, but she's ready.

703
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,320
让我想到了出去后
Makes me think of the first thing

704
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,980
第一件要干的事情
I'll do when we're gonna get out.

705
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,230
有谁知道西班牙语"别开枪"怎么说?
Just, does anybody know what's spanish for"don't shoot"?

706
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,120
No dispare (注 西班牙语 别开枪)
No dispare.

707
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,190
"No dis"什么?
No dis what?

708
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,700
放松点 没人会被射杀的
Just relax. nobody's gonna get shot.

709
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,750
别紧张
Just don't panic.

710
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,020
林肯一切断电源 我们就走
As soon as Linc cuts the power, we go.

711
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,520
那怎么对付巡逻吉普车怎么对付?
What about the jeep patrol?

712
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,550
已经解决了
Taken care of.

713

那后备发电机呢?
What about the backup generator?

714

后备发电机
Backup generator?

715
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,770
没人提及过呀
Nobody said anything about 

716
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,420
在后备电源恢复供电前
There's a lag from when the power

717
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,340
会有个真空期
Cuts out to when the nerator kicks back in.

718
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,170
这个真空期有多久?
Well, how long a lag are we talking about here?

719
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,320
30秒钟
30 seconds.

720
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,630
你认为我们30秒钟能跑出去?
You expect us to run in 30 seconds?

721
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,770
灯一熄灭 我就出发
As soon as the lights go out, I'm gone.

722
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,520
去不去随你
With or without you.

没关系 我可以等
That's fine. I-I can wait until 

728

we found a slight problem

这小兔崽子来这里干什么?
You want to tell us what the hell the taquito's doing down here?

738
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,380
-他和我们一起走 -我可没答应
He's coming with us. I don't think so.

739
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,840
这不管你的事
That's not up to you.

740
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,890
我觉得我该管
I should I think.

741

我们已经另外做好了打算
See, we made up our own decision here.

743
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,980
因为时间
Well, with the time frame

744
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,590
是这样的短暂
Being so short and all,

745
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,150
我们觉得先走一步 会好很多
We'd feel a whole lot better about things if we go first.

746
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,420
你会怎么做 杀了我?
What are you gonna do, kill me?

747
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,210
不 不会 听着 如果我们不先走

听着 我可以解释这一切
Look, I think I can explain all this.

如果你让我去车里取文书的话
If I could just get some paperwork from my car

752
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,850
你哪儿也去不了
You're not going anywhere.

753
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,790
听明白了吗?
Understand?

754
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,240

人不为己 天诛地灭是吧?
Every man for himself, right?

不 我会守在最后
No, I think I'm gonna stay back he.

我只是不愿意把后背暴露给任何人

761
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,690
30秒钟时间
