1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,390
之前从未有人从这越过狱
No one's ever broken out of this place before,

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,990
更别说只有一周时间来策划
let alone with a week to plan, so you tell these people

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,090
你去告诉那帮人 我会尽力助他越狱
I'm gonna break this guy out of here

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,000
甚至不惜付出生命的代价
or I'm going to die trying.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,990
我需要你留下做我耳目
You're going to stay on as my ears.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,200
向我汇报所有你听说的消息
You'll report back to me everything you hear

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,300
当我不在场的时候
when I'm not around.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,990
我知道你有个哥哥在外面接应你
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,590
他跑去找了我女友
I know he ran into my girlfriend,

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,590
还知道他从她那儿抢走了我的书
and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,300
他们抢走了的我的宝贝
This is what they took from me.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,800
所以说白了
So let's be clear,

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,200
这才是我关心的事情
this is what matters to me.

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,900
而不是你
Not you.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,700
更不是你的书
And not your book.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
LJ怎样? 莎拉怎样?
How's LJ? How's Sara?

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,400
他们说都很好
They told me they're fine.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,400
你还有什么瞒着我?
What are you not telling me?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,290
并非只有你一个牵涉其中 
You're not the only one affected 

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,590
他们杀了莎拉头割下弃在盒中 
They killed Sara and put her head in a box 

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,100
他们还抓走了我的儿子
And they got my son 

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,900
你没有时间了
you are running out of the time

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,200
什么东西
what's that?

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,900
一只老鼠
A rat.

25
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,300
J.P盖迪(美首位亿万富翁)有一个成功的口诀
J.P. Getty had a formula for success.

26
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,200
早早起身 好好工作
"Rise early, work hard,

27
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,590
钱包鼓鼓
strike oil."

28
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,900
阿历克斯我只是来喝杯水
Just trying to get a drink of water, Alex.

29
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,090
作为你精湛技艺的虔诚的崇拜者
As a devoted student of your work and skills,

30
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,990
我真的非常期待
I-I really look forward

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,690
和你一起共同实施计划 迈克
to progress on your plan, Michael.

32
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,100
我期待你能别老缠着我
I'm looking forward to you getting off my back.

33
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,100
臭小子 欢迎你来索纳监狱
Buenos, welcome to Sona.

34
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
那是你的皮夹子吗?
Is that your wallet?

35
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,000
该死的皮夹子
Dame tu billetera.

36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,300
抱歉 我不懂西班牙语
No hablo Espal, uh?

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
你明白我说的意思
You know what I said.

38
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,600
不明白
No.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
你不该这么回答的
That's the wrong answer.

40
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,100
只要你搞定了 我随时可以跟你出去
I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are.

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,000
斯科菲尔德有访客
Scofield,visita.

42
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,300
斯科菲尔德有访客
scofield, you have a visitor.

43
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,700
长夜漫漫啊
You look like you had a long night.

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
没错
Yeah.

45
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,400
我花了很久喂老鼠吃巧克力
I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat.

46
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,100
这几天都没有整块时间可以开工的
I don't have a whole lot to work with these days.

47
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
她拿走了那本书 鸟类导读
She's got the book, man, the bird guide.

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
她发现了
She worked it out.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,600
那我们手上没有筹码了
So we have no leverage.

50
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,790
-没了 -告诉我
-No. -Tell me

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,390
当你递上那本书的时候
When you were handing over the book,

52
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,290
你有没有要LJ和莎拉的最新照片
did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara?

53
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,100
是的
Yeah.

54
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,100
那照片呢?
And where is it?

55
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,490
她给我看了照片 但是不肯给我
She showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep them.

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,490
老弟 我可没有资格和他们谈条件
Man, I'm not in a position to bargain with these people.

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,800
我是说他们已经被激怒了
I mean, they're pissed.

58
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,300
明天就得越狱出来
You break out tomorrow.

59
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,890
让我们只关注越狱一事吧
Let's just focus on that.

60
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,200
回到正题上来
Let's keep on track.

61
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,500
好吧
All right.

62
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,190
当我在狱内开工的时候
While I'm working from the inside,

63
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,590
我需要你去准备下
I need you to take care of what happens

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,890
逃出来后的事宜
once we're outside.

65
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,190
需要辆车逃之夭夭
We're going to need a getaway vehicle,

66
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,100
不惹眼的那种
something inconspicuous.

67
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,390
不管你找到什么车 明天下午3点
Whatever you find, it has to be parked

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,590
必须停在离这半英里的地方
a half mile from here by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:33,790
你是说凌晨3点?
You mean a.m.

70
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,500
不 确实是下午
No, I mean p.m.

71
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
林肯 我们没得选
We don't have a choice, Linc.

72
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,990
昨晚上我做了些测试
I ran some tests last night.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
军方吉普车夜晚在周边巡逻
Military jeeps patrol the perimeter at night.

74
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,000
晚上根本无法分辨他们在什么方位
There's no way of telling where they're going to be in the dark.

75
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,900
整晚上他们都在外面巡逻
They were out there all night.

76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,900
我们需要夜幕遮掩 不能就 
We need the dark, we can't just Just 

77
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,200
拜托别争了
Please.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
因为明天就要动手了
Because we're doing this tomorrow.

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
中午时分行动
In the middle of the day.

80
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,000
你看谁呢?
Who're you looking at?

81
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,900
那家伙
That guy.

82
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,100
我认识他
I know him.

83
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,240
小麦迪朋友 我需要块手表
McGrady, my friend, I'm going to need a watch.

84
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,450
或许要2块
Maybe two.

85
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,450
我不会问其中原因了
I'm not even going to ask why.

86
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,650
我还需要些双筒望远镜
I'm also going to need some binoculars.

87
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,750
老威廉倒是有个
Old Guillermo has a pair.

88
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,250
他根本不可能卖给你
There's no way he'll sell them to you, man.

89
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,840
但是望远镜也不算难搞定
But they shouldn't be hard to get.

90
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,450
我上哪里能找到他?
Where can I find this guy?

91
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,850
我们明天行动
We leave tomorrow.

92
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,450
这个 
This 

93
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,750
这是我们逃离索纳监狱的方案
This is how we're getting out of Sona.

94
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,440
逃出监狱隔栏
Getting out of the cell block

95
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,240
应该不是什么问题
shouldn't be a problem.

96
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,050
围壁栅栏很容易突破
The grate and bars are weak,

97
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,140
但是我们需要些绳索
but we're going to need some kind of rope,

98
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,750
还有梯子 这样可以从另外边下去
some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side.

99
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,440
那就是我标出最安全的线路
That's why I figured out the safest

100
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,350
从这里到栅栏的那个洞的原因
line from here to the hole in the fence.

101
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,850
我们白天动手
We do it in the day,

102
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,350
只有塔楼上的2个警卫能看到我们
we'll only be visible to the two guard towers.

103
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,450
周边警卫的情况很难说
The perimeter guards are less predictable,

104
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,240
但是他们只有在晚上才出没
but they're only on at night.

105
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,340
大白天的穿越监狱逃跑?
Scurrying across the field in the middle of the day?

106
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,350
这是唯一避开巡逻吉普车的方法
It's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol.

107
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,350
明天下午2点 监狱大院里会有场球赛
Now, in the yard tomorrow, there's a soccer game at 2:00.

108
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,640
应该会吸引狱内很多注意力
That should prove some distraction inside.

109
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,240
昨天我们在挖洞的时候
And yesterday when we were digging,

110
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,340
我看到太阳光照射到这个家伙
I saw the glare from the sun hit this guy

111
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,850
在晌午时分
in the late afternoon.

112
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,540
看上去他就会转身
Looked like he turned away,

113
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,250
好似视线受阻似的
like maybe his vision was blocked.

114
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,550
这样还不足以越狱
It's not much of a break.

115
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,640
不 但这是唯一的方法
No, but it is

116
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,750
我们必须这么去做
one way to do what we need to do.

117
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,240
还有个警卫
As far as thisther guard,

118
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,150
必须找出他的弱点
his weakness has yet to be termined.

119
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,050
如果我们要和这帮警卫周旋
If we're going to get around these guys,

120
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,150
就必须得了解他们
we've got to get to know them.

121
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,550
这可没这么简单
It's not going to be easy.

122
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,540
只有一条正真意义上的路通往监狱
There's only one real road that goes to the prison.

123
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,950
我们不走大路 不用考虑了
We don't want a real road that's not an option.

124
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,650
怎么了?
What?

125
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,550
留给你兄弟的时间所剩无几
Your brother's cutting it close.

126
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:21,840
你说一周的
You said a week.

127
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,840
明天就周三了 可没空闲犯错了
Tomorrow's Wednesday, you didn't leave much room for error.

128
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,550
根本不会犯什么错
There's not going to be an"error."

129
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,340
听着 我有一堆事要处理 还要 
Listen, I've got a lot of stuff to do and I just 

130
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,340
那就是为何我不会浪费你的时间
Which is why I won't waste your time.

131
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,940
当惠斯勒出来后 我需要
When Whistler's free, I need to get to him

132
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,640
立刻见到他
as soon as possible.

133
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,040
我还在为他们逃出栅栏后
I'm still trying to work out what's going

134
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,850
可能发生的事情忙活着
to happen once they get past the fence.

135
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,540
一旦我知道所有细节 我会让你 
Once I know all the details, I'll let you 

136
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,440
林肯 冷静
Lincoln, calm down.

137
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,640
你让我觉得
It sounds to me like you

138
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,350
你们两兄弟似乎有点焦头烂额
and your brother are in over your heads.

139
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,950
莎拉的事 很抱歉
There's a bad joke about Sara somewhere in there.

140
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,750
听着
Listen 

141
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,840
我会把详情都告诉你的
I'll let you know all the details

142
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,850
我一知道就会打电话给你
once I know them, and then I'll call you.

143
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,150
我和你们一样 希望这事能解决
I want this to work out just as badly as you do.

144
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,550
你比我们还急 我知道
MoreI'm sure.

145
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,950
LJ 呢?
LJ?

146
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,450
LJ 很好 你还有34个小时
LJ's fine. You have 34 hours.

147
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,150
她说什么了?
What did she say?

148
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,840
都是些废话
Nothing we don't already know.

149
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,750
走吧 有好多事要做呢
Let's get out of here; we got a lot of stuff to do.

150
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,250
瑞弗拉先生么?
Seir Rivera?

151
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,550
谁?
Who?

152
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,750
你是约格・瑞弗拉对吗?
You're Jorge Rivera, right?

153
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,750

你没事吧?
You okay?

312
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,090
没事 这办法行不通
Yeah. This is not gonna work.

313
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,990
-海滩离这里多远? -我不知道 大概三英里吧
-Where's the coast from here? -I don't know, maybe three miles.

314
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,800
好吧 实行B计划 走吧
All right, time for plan B. Come on.

315
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,890
再多找点过来
Found some more of these.

316
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
我们可以用吊床来做绳子
We can make rope out of this hammock.

317
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,500
走吧 你不是想要去那里吧
Come on. You don't want to go in there.

318
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,200
如果你要出去的话 我就得这么做
If you want to get out of this place I do.

319
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
待着别动
Stay here.

320
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,900

快点
Come on 

323
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
这个是什么 连锁反应?
What is it, chained down?

324
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
真是千钧一发啊
It's hanging by a thread.

325
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
得等等了
It'll have to wait.

326
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,900
已经4:30了
It's 4:30.

327
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,190
-只剩下24小时不到了 -我们能搞定
-We've got less than 24 hours. -We'll make it.

328
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,490
-告诉我为什么? -什么?
-Tell me why.-What?

329
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,290
什么事情这么紧急
What's so urgent we can't get

330
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,890
我非得在后天之前把你弄出去?
you out of here the day after tomorrow?

331
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,700
我不知道 我什么都不知道
I don't know. I don't have all the answers.

332
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,900
你不了解我 我也不了解你
You don't me, I don't know you,

333
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,800
但是把我弄出去是你的任务
but it's your job to get me out of here.

334
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,500
晚点再过来吧
We'll come back later.

335
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,600
我要个这个
I'll take this as well.

336
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,890
-过来避暑的? -是的
Down here for the summer? Yep.

337
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,790
我也是这么认为 回溯到1985年
That's what I thought, back in 1985.

338
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,490
我有两个妻子 20年过去了
Two wives, 20 years later.

339
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,800
还有其他需要吗?
Want everything in here?

340
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,200
没了 谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

341
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,800
公海有多远?
International waters far out?

342
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,390
12海里
That's 12 nautical miles.

343
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,000
12海里 对吗?
12 nautical miles, huh?

344
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,090
就要这些了?
Is that gonna do it here?

345
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,600
是的
Uh, yeah.

346
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
99.25美元
$99.25.

347
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,490
给你
Here.

348
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
好了
All right.

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,500
谢谢你
Thank you.

350
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:12,790
你拿的是什么?
What did you get?

351
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,690
供给装备 你能帮我打开后车盖吗?
Supplies. Can you pop the trunk, please?

352
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,490
说实话我还能告诉谁?
Who am I gonna tell, honestly?

353
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,200
你可能是个俄罗斯间谍
You could be a Russian spy for all I know.

354
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,190
把这些丢了吧?
Live out of this thing?

355
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,390
我得做好准备
I have to be

356
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,800
以防不测
prepared in case of an emergency.

357
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,400
好吧 我们有件紧急的事
Well, we got an emergency.

358
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,590
除非你告诉我要去哪
I'm not going anywhere

359
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,990
不然我哪也不去
until you tell me where we're going.

360
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,400
-索拉纳海滩 -去那干吗?
Solana Beach. Why?

361
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,500
他们杀了莎拉
They killed Sara.

362
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,200
我得确保他们没杀我儿子
I'm trying to make damn sure they don't kill my son.

363
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,190
如果你不考虑一下
You don't think for a second

364
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,520
你男朋友还在监狱的话 就待在这里吧
your boy's not on that list, stay here.

365
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,910
我太在乎他了
I couldn't care less.

366
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,600
怎么了?
What is it?

367
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,190
是奥古斯特
It's Augusto.

368
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:18,860
他不会
He won't

369
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,010
再给你钱了
pay the payment for you anymore.

370
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,930
我每周一照例问他要钱 但是 
I went to him for payment like every Monday, and 

371
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,290
他说这不是他的职责
he said it's not his responsibility

372
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,790
我得问你要
and that I should ask you.

373
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,770
不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

374
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,090
你告诉奥古斯特
You tell Augusto

375
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,750
我不为性爱买单
I don't pay for sex.

376
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,350
我知道 我这么说了
I know, I did.

377
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,190
但是 我能做什么?
But what I do?

378
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,420
我找不到其他人了 
I don't see anyone else 

379
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,670
是吗?
Yeah?

380
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,850
我也是
Well, neither do I.

381
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,160
你是负责食物的?
You in charge of the food now?

382
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,940
不 长官 我是新来的挖墓人
No boss. I'm the new gravedigger.

383
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,500
你上车前
You need to sign in

384
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,760
要先登记
before you get on the truck.

385
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,090
我正准备去
I was just about to.

386
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,740
你读过规章手册了吗?
Have you read the rulebook?

387
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,090
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

388
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,990
再好好读读
Read it again.

389
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,140
换句话说 我们出去之后
On the other side, when we get out of here,

390
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,010
会发生什么?
what's gonna happen?

391
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,410
我们得会一会组织的人
We're gonna meet someone from this company 

392
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,900
当然
Apparently.

393
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,900
他们会杀了我
And then they're gonna kill me.

394
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,320
你知道的
You know that.

395
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,600
如果他们要杀你的话
If they wanted to kill you,

396
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,170
你早就死了
you'd already be dead.

397
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,630
我不知道他们干吗让我活着
I don't see why they keep me alive.

398
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,280
就像你说的 你有他们要的东西
It's like you said you've got something they want.

399
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,630
我告诉他们的话 我就没利用价值了
Once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them.

400
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,830
对吗?
Right?

401
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,800
我什么都不知道
I don't have all the answers.

402
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,350
我只知道我要把你弄出去
All I know is it's my job to get you out of here.

403
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,090
走吧
Let's go.

404
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,610
这是周三的两剂毒品 我特意给你留的
It's twofer Tuesday, my one-time special just for you.

405
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,000
但是不能白给你
But there's a price.

406
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,910
勒齐对流动资金很敏感
Lechero's getting pret sensitive about the cash flow.

407
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,750
我现在手头紧
Well, I'm a little short right now.

408
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,360
别担心 阿历克斯
No worries, Alex.

409
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,090
我不会让你为难的 好吗?
I am not gonna leave you hanging, all right?

410
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,960
我们可以给你赊账
We can just start you a tab.

411
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,120
他看到我们了吗?
Think he saw us?

412
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,030
猜猜我们能找到什么
Guess we'll find out.

413
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,090
我大三的时候
My third year in school,

414
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,250
我学的是电力工程EMP专业
we studied electrical engineering with a focus on EMPs.

415
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,760
EMP就是电磁脉冲的意思
That's electromagnetic pulses.

416
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,460
如果你把能量源放到发射器上
If you hook up a pow source to a transmitter,

417
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,330
就能发射电磁脉冲
it generates a pulse.

418
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,950
脉冲会干扰所有的电子设备
That pulse crashes anything electronic.

419
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,800
那是什么 就像简介
What's that, like an intro

420
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,860
反恐战略的简介?
an intro into anti-terrorist tactics?

421
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,250
差不多吧 这些天
Basically. These days,

422
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,040
他们教学生
they have to teach students how to defend

423
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,700
如何保护他们的结构
their structures.

424
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,230
幸运的是 那个监视塔
Fortunately for us, that guard tower is 

425
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,380
已经造好很久了
It was engineered a long time ago.

426
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,700
我猜你是基础科学的常胜将军
I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair.

427
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,380
把这个插上去
Plug this in.

428
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,290
电视信号受干扰了吗?
Did it crash the telly?

429
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,980
我们隔得太远了
We're too far away.

430
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,710
但是起作用了 正如我们需要的那样
But it is doing exactly what we need it to.

431
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,240
没事
Okay.

432
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,030
-快出来 -为什么?
Get out Why?

433
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,560
他们冲进来了
They're coming in.

434
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,610
马上离开这
Ahora mismo.

435
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,770
呆在这 别让人发现她
Stay here. Do not let them see her.

436
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,200
千万别被发现 
Do not 

437
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,930
上校
Colonel.

438
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,930
我们没有收到通知啊
We received no word of this 

439
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,620
塔楼上发现了狙击枪瞄准镜
A rifle scope waseen from the tower.

440
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,610
胡塔多队长亲眼所见的
Capitan Hurtado saw it with his own eyes.

441
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,410
根本不可能
That's impossible.

442
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,820
狱中有把枪
There is a gun in your prison,

443
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,380
而且瞄准着我的人
and it was pointing at one of my men.

444
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,990
我们会找出来的
We are going to find it.

445
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,900
这看上去很不错
This looks good.

446
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,480
怎么说?
For what?

447
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,870
坐下
Have a seat.

448
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,660
我在这边应该
What am I supposed

449
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,960
干些什么呢?
to doing here?

450
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,600
表现的你很享受就行
Look like you're having fun.

451
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,310
你最后一次见到你儿子是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw your son?

452
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,680
林肯 你该知道的
You know, Lincoln,

453
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,380
我不会轻信别人
I don't automatically trust people either,

454
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,160
但至少我能分辨他们是否出于善意
but at least I can tell when they have good intentions.

455
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,680
能这样不错
Good for you.

456
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,580
我不会再来证明自己的立场
You know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore.

457
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,980
我们互不相干 各忙各的
You do your job, and I'll do mine.

458
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,210
你需要什么?
You need something?

459
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,140
-你说什么? -你需要什么?
What? You need something?

460
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,550
不需要
No.

461
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,960
很好
Good.

462
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,010
别担心 会没事的
Don't you worry. It's all gonna be okay.

463
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,290
-会有麻烦的 -我向你保证
No, it's not. I promise you, I will not let

464
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,410
我不会让任何人发现你在这里
anyone find you in here.

465
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,490
勒齐一定恨死我了
Oh Lechero hate me.

466
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,480
勒齐不会恨你

不过说老实话
but I'd be lying

522
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,190
当时可真够险的
if I didn't say it was a close call.

523
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,400
她现在一个人待着?

00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,090
月底时候拿我的那份补上

我只是一直没机会跟你汇报这事
I just didn't get a chance to tell you.

538

她根本没钱回家
She had no money to get home.

539

你一定不愿让你情人一分钱不带就上路的
Surely you don't want your mistress travelin' broke.

543
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,890
不然的话 她就算打到车
She'd end up in a taxi

544
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,100
也没钱付打的费啊
with no way to pay the cab fare.

545
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,300
啊 你这么做
Ah, you did this?

你是真心实意的替我着想了
And now you do the thinking for me.

552
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,400
也不能都这么说 老大

我不知道
I don't know.

557

这个回答可不怎么样

得了 给我点时间考虑一下

我可不能在这里耗下去了 迈克
Wasting time is not an option for me, Michael.

我明天必须得出去

一个人闯进我的公寓 拿走了我的通讯录
