375
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,630
有人跟来了
We got company.

376
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,250
他们怎么能找到我们?
How'd they find us?

我们马上超上去了
We're right on top of them.

00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,930
抓紧了
Hold on 

380
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,740
他们或许盯上了格雷迪的老爸 对车动了手脚
They must've gotten to Grady's dad and bugged this car.

381
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,750
或者是我们中的一个
Or one of us.

382
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,180
那在水里的时候 他们怎么没有发现我们?
Then why didn't they find us when we were in the water?

383
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,040
那是因为水阻隔了信号
It's because the water was blocking the signal.

384
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,220
你还戴着格雷琴给你的手表干嘛呢?
What you do with that stopwatch that Gretchen gave you?

385
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,010
天啊 我不知道
Oh, my god. I didn't know.

386
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,240
我真不知道
I didn't know.

387

好了 抓紧了 伙计们
Okay, hold on, guys.

好了 这回该利用一下地形了

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,640
我们上路吧
Go here we go 

390
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,100
这好像是条死路
Uh this is, like, a dead end right here.

391
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,470
别呆在车里
Stay in the car, then.

392
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,200
走这边
This way 

393
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,330
为什么你就是不招呢
Why don't you just tell us what you know?

394
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,970
你不会想尝尝被打得半死的滋味吧
Then you won't wind up being beaten half to death

395
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,960
-就像你的朋友一样 -我不比你知道的多
Like your friend. I know less than you do.

396
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,750
孰轻孰重 你心知肚明
Which is hard, considering how dumb you are.

397
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,230
我想知道逃犯留下的所有蛛丝马迹
I want everything you can find on the men who escaped

398
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,880
我现在就想要
And I want it immediately.

399
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,070
他怎么还在这里?
What the hell is he still doing here?

400
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,380
除非是谋杀
Unless it's for murder

401
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,830
让他出去 
get him out of here 

402
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,410
去管办事员要你的东西
Go see the clerk about your stuff.

403
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,100
他们被包围了
They're barricaded.

404
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,720
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

405
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,580
快回来
Get back 

406
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,720
枪声一直没停
All that gunfire and they only

407
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,120
但他们只击中了你的车三次
Hit your car three times?

408
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,420
浑蛋
Son of a bi 

409
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,980
听着 林肯 你干的漂亮
Listen, Linc, you've done a great job getting us

410
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,510
带我们脱离险境 但这没用
Out of the frying pan, but it'll be for nothing

411
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,860
如果我们最终被打死的话
If we end up back in the fire.

412
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,160
这儿没有交火 只是一个交易
There's no fire, just an exchange,

413
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,090
你就是交换品
Then I'm done with you.

414
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,120
你真认为就这么简单
You think it's that simple?

415
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,930
恩 他们要你 他们得到你 就这么简单
Yeah, they want you, they get you. it's that simple.

416
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,740
这和我无关 这关系到索菲亚和你儿子 迈克
This is not about me. it's about Sofia and ur son. Michael 

417
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,300
告诉他 告诉他这些人
Tell him tell him these people

418
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,310
不会就这样让我们离开的
Won't just let us walk away.

419
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,220
我们在海滩上已经讨论了这件事 詹姆斯
We already had this discussion back at the beach, James,

420
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,600
你也被说服了
And you were outvoted.

421
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,350
你犯了个可怕的错误
You're making a terrible mistake.

422
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,730
有人会因此送命
People might die because of this.

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,420
脱掉裤子
Take off your pants.

我让你脱掉的裤子
I said take off your pants.

426
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,160
如果我知道你们这帮索纳的家伙会来这套
If I knew you boys partied in Sona like this,

427
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,430
我就不跑了
I never would have tried to escape.

428
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,240

用不着阉了我吧
There's no need to refry my beans.

437
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,680
放聪明点
Always with the wise talk.

438
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,690
别说任何我们不想听得话
Never saying anything we want to hear.

439
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,360
现在 我只想听你的惨叫声
Now, all I want to hear are your screams.

440

这是我们交易的地方

你只从家偷了这个么
You steal that one from home alone?
