1
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,510
小子 你给个决斗的理由
Explain something to me, blanco,

2
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,800
前一分钟 你刚为他捡回性命
One minute you plead for your friend's life,

3
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,250
后一分钟 你又要结果了他
and the next minute you nt to take it.

4
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,680
这家伙
This man 

5
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,380
这家伙根本不是我的朋友 
this man is no friend of mine 

6
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,900
你女友发生的事情和我无关 
What happened to your girlfriend has nothing 

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,600
她名字叫 莎拉 
Her name was Sara 

8
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,060
她是个好人
And she was a good person.

9
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,650
要不是因为你
And she'd still be alive

10
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,770
她活得好好的
if it wasn't for you.

11
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,420
这么说是为了复仇咯?
So it's revenge, eh, b?

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,930
一报还一报
An eye for an eye?

13
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,330
一旦做出决斗的决定 就不能收回来
Once you make such a declaration there's no going back.

14
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,870
没什么好顾虑的了
There's nothing to go back to.

15
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,060
很好
Good.

16
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,890
那么就开始决斗吧
Then we have a fight.

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,960
你们俩个马上去
Now, both of you,

18
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,300
整理所属物品
go and assign your belongings,

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,170
然后祈祷上苍站在你这边
and pray to whatever god is yours.

20
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,590
15分钟后回来
Come back here in 15 minutes.

21
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,680
斗 斗 斗
Fight, fight, fight, fight 

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:06,140
斗 斗 斗
fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight fight 

23
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,940
你还需要别的帮助吗?
You need anymore help?

24
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,130
你帮的忙够多的了
You've done more than enough.

25
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,610
老兄 接着这个
Here, take that, man.

26
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,260
虽说钱不多 但足够你重新开始了
It's not a lot, but it's enough to get you started.

27
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,550
不 不行 我不能接受这钱
Oh, no, no, I can't take this.

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,600
我这么做是因为我想帮你们
I did this because I wanted to help you guys.

29
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,200
去买辆车 买张大巴车票什么的
Hey, buy a car, get a bus ticket,

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,850
随你怎样办 就是离开这就行
do whatever, just get out of here.

31
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,030
多谢了
Thanks.

32
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,450
我去加些油 行吗?
I'm going to get so gas, okay?

33
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,380
我们在前头会合
I'll meet you in the front.

34
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,590
好的
All right.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,530
好运
Good luck.

36
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,600
同祝
You too.

37
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,980
她和你一起去交换人质?
Is she coming with you to do the exchange?

38
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,050
是的
Yeah.

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,380
你觉得这样合适吗?
You think that's a good idea?

40
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,860
我是说如果有什么麻烦的话
I mean, what if something goes wrong

41
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,360
-她还会受伤呢 -我需要个保障
and she gets hurt? I need some incentive

42
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,390
以防 惠斯勒 耍什么鬼把戏
just in case Whistler doesn't want to go quietly.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,490
你觉得这一切都能平稳度过?
You think any of this is going to go down quiet?

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,600
就这样把LJ还给你了?
They're just going to give you LJ

45
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,530
我怎么想的根本无关紧要
just like that? Doesn't matter what I think.

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,350
我很清楚这帮子人会怎么干
I know what these people are capable of.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,270
我不会拿我儿子的命去赌博的
I'm not going to gamble with my son's life.

48
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,760
或许你根本不需要什么赌博
Maybe you don't have to.

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,400
阿历克斯
Alex.

50
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,770
阿历克斯

15分钟后就到审判厅了

54
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,340
所有这一切马上就能了结了

55
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,720
很好
Good.

56
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,790
听上去很不错
That sounds good.

57
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,890
那么这场交易中 
So with this deal 

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,460
他们到底想从我这获得什么呢?
what specifically are they expecting from me?

59
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,940
他们需要知道所有这一切
They need to knoeverything.

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,760
关于总统的 关于组织的事情
About the President, about the company.

61
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,300
他们需要确认你手上有
They want to confirm that you have

62
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,190
确凿的能证明他们犯罪的信息
viable incriminating information

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,380
而且你还需要配合去做证
and that you can be a cooperative witness.

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,300
如果我完全配合的话
If I cooperate fully 

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,890
我不会只起诉他们有罪
I won't just be incriminating them.

66
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,010
你担心你会受到牵连
You're worried about all those skeletons in your closet,

67
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,890
你有完全赦免权
but you have full immunity.

68
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,610
所有这一切都会没事的
Everything will be fine.

69
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,710
你只需要说出事实真相就行
All you have to do is tell the truth.

70
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,350
保持冷静
Stay calm.

71
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,910
最好活动下筋骨热热身
Better knuckle up.

72
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,370
听着 我不知道你是怎么想的
Look, I don't know what you're thinking,

73
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:58,950
但是杀了我
but killing me is not

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
-于事无补 -别紧张
going to solve your problem. Relax.

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,430
我不会杀你的
I'm not going to kill you.

76
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,580
那刚才那幕又是为了什么?
Then what the hell was all that about? 

77
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,430
你如果想不被发现 从这里越狱出去
You want to make it out of here without being seen,

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,190
你就需要转移视线 就像现在这样
you need a diversion. Now we have one.

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
你昏头了 你不知道他们还在那边等着
You're off your head. Do you know that? They're waiting 

80
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,810
我们没时间争这个 快3点了
We don't have time for this. It's almost 3:00,

81
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,120
意味着塔楼哨兵现在应该被迷药放倒了
and that means the tower guard should be drugged by now.

82
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,670
3:13分时 阳光会照射在另一哨塔上
At 3:13, the sun's going to hit the other guard tower.

83
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,360
有了所需的掩护 机不可失 时不再来
We'll have the cover we need. It's now or never.

84
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,810
听着 迈克 我 
Listen, Michael, I, uh 

85
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,320
刚才关于莎拉的话 不是那个意思
I meant what I said about Sara.

86
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,430
换作我 就绝口不提那名字了
If I were you I wouldn'tention that name again.

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,170
我们现在就出去 然后用你交换我侄子
We're getting out of here now, and then I'm trading you for my nephew.

88
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,940
然后我会去查清楚
And then I'm going to find out

89
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,450
真凶是谁的
who's responsible for taking her life 

90
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,760
然后血债血还
and I'm taking theirs.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,620
-听着 斯科菲尔德 -现在不是时候
Listen, Scofield Not now.

92
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,960
我只是 求你了
I just please.

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,310
你在外面说的我听到了
I heard you out there in the yard.

94
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,000
关于莎拉的事情
Is that true

95
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,300
是不是真的?
about Sara?

96
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,580

她怎么 ?
What'd she ?

99
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,650
对不起 迈克
I'm sorry, Michael.

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,170
我是这个意思
I mean it.

101
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,620
她是好人
She was a good person.

102
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,260
对不起

怎么了?
Is something wrong?

104
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:54,780
如果有人问起
If anyone asks,

105
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,870
告诉他们油箱漏油 好吗?
just tell them your fuel pump's leaking, all right?

106
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,670
不 不 我要和你一起去海边
No, no, no, I'm going to the beach with you.

107
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,630
不 我需要你来把风
No. I need you to keep a lookout.

108
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,690
他们来了我会告诉你的 好吗?
When they get here I'll call you, all right?

109
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,480
如果今天一切顺利
If everything works out today,

110
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,470
你和我 都能得到想要的
you and me we're both going to get what we want.

都已经受够了
for this over with as I am.

为将来打算 就那样

你能否见到那天 已经不在我的掌握
Whether you see it isn't up to me anymore.

128
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,150
在于你的叔叔
It's in your uncle's hands now.

129
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,820
所以让我们祈祷他能做到吧
So let's just hope that he does his job.

130
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,460
你还在等什么?

为什么? 我是说 怎么会?

我们还是多关心一下自己吧 怎么样?

有什么问题吗?
Something wrong?

143

几个巴拿马人有点退缩了
A couple of the Panamanians might have gotten cold feet.

144
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,070
有多胆小?
Exactly how cold?

145
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,890
他们只是需要确认

放松 这仍旧是你最好的机会

Now, remember, we'll only have four minutes of cover,

156
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,390
你一着地 就笔直跑向围栏
so once you hit the ground you run straight to the fence.

157
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,170
不要看上面 也别回头
Don't look up, don't look back,

158

不要说一个字
don't say a word.

159
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,490
要是他们看见我们呢?
What if they see us?

160
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,080
如果有人喊你停
If someone yells stop,

161
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,920
你就停

时间到了

那么谁先下?
So, who goes first?

168
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,140
你要是不活着出去 我的生命也没有意义
Right now my life isn't worth a damn without yours.

169
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,620
如果不是按照计划行事

先下的人就会被射杀

171
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,810
那个人不能是你
That guy can't be you.

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,200
我先下吧
I'll go.

173
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,200
我明白了
I got it.

174
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,210
快 快

你也是
You, too.

187
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,580
我们快失去阳光了
We're losing the light.

188

这该死的东西解不开
The damn thing's not coming off 

197
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,900

这一切都是
This has all been

213
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,600
一场巨大的误会

我们的问题都解决了

没有必要再进行决斗了
There's no need to take this any further.

217

显然你不太明白
You clearly don't understand

218
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,790
我不能让你们的愚昧在这里肆虐
I can't have your foolishness spread in this place.

219

我给过你这么多机会放弃决斗
I gave you every chance to pull out.

220
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,300
求你了

你们不动手的话 我来帮忙

对不起了 如果只能有一个人活着

有个司机 有个保镖 就那么多

你在哪啊
Where are you?

241
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,190
你在这干吗?
What you doing here?

242

243
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,500
只是确认下 看看是否一切正常
Just checking, making sure everything is all right.

244
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,900
他们行动有点延迟 没什么
They're running a bit late, that's all.

245
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,100
下一步呢?
So, what's the plan?

246
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,000
游出去 等警察过去了 然后 
You gonna swim out, wait for the police to pass, and 

247
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,900
在某个地方上船?
meet with a boat somewhere?

248
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,800
差不多就是那样
Something like that.

249
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,190
那再然后呢?
And then what?

250
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,690

让人吃惊啊
I'm impressed.

253
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,290
拿着枪指着我
You've actually got the guts to look me in the eye

254
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,700
还有勇气跟我对视
as you stab me in the back.

255
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,490
你会怎么做 打死我?
What are you going to do, shoot me?

256
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,590
别动 我不能眼看着你把詹姆斯
Don't. I can't let you hand over

257
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,590
送到那些人手上
James to those people.

258
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,690
你得考虑考虑你在干嘛
You need to think about what you're doing.

259
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,100
我想过了 
I have 

260
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,600
在你告诉我他们对莎拉做了什么之后
Every since you told me what they did to Sara.

261
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
他们到了之后 詹姆斯和我就离开
When they get here, James and I, we're leaving.

262
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,790
去哪?
Where to?

263
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,700
我不知道 一个他们找不到的地方
I don't know. Somewhere they won't find us.

264
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,890
那么这一段时间以来 你都在耍我
So, this whole time, you played me.

265
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,290
就像你在耍我一样
Like you've been playing me.

266
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,400
带我来这里 帮你把风?
Bringing me here to be your lookout?

267
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
不过没什么
But it's okay.

268
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,990
我们来这里都是
We were both here doing what we had to

269
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,500
为了我们深爱的人做该做的事
for the people we love.

270
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,400
你这么做的话 你也等于亲手杀了我儿子
You do this, you may as well be shooting my son yourself.

271
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,600
对不起
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,590
他们这个时候该出来了 有消息没?
They should be out by now. Any sign?

273
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,690
一切都很安静
All quiet.

274
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,300
你准备给他们多少时间?
How much longer do you want to give them?

275
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,990
我知道你下半辈子
I know you wanted to live

276
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,500
想住在海边
by an ocean your whole life.

277
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,380
真可惜
Sad to think

278
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,910
你只能葬身在海边了
the closest you'll get is being buried under one.

279
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,290
你不会杀了我的
You're not gonna kill me.

280
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,790
-是吗? -你需要我
Oh? You need me.

281
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,890
你已经杀了莎拉
You already killed Sara.

282
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,500
我要再有什么事的话
Anything happens to me,

283
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,690
你手上就没有筹码了
you're out of bargaining chips.

284
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,800
如果迈克今天不把惠斯勒救出来
If Michael doesn't get Whistler out today,

285
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
我就不再需要什么筹码了
I won't need to bargain anymore.

286
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
你们都要死
You'll all be dead.

287
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,790

狠狠的踢他 斯科菲尔德 
Kick him in the junk, Scofield 

297
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,290
你们在等什么? 这里没有平局的说法 
What are you looking for, boy There are no draws here 

298
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,690

我会下来了结你们两个

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,190
你在干嘛?
What are you doing over there?

302
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,100
什么 你居然当班的时候睡觉?
What, are you sleeping on the job?

303
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,200
不 我不知道发生什么了
No, I don't know what happened.

304
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,690
下手吧
End it.

305
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,600
上帝啊 请原谅我
God God forgive me.

306
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,990
他们这个时候该到了
They should have been here by now.

307
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,100
或许他们已经出来了 正在赶来
Maybe they get out. They should be on their way.

308
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,290
-他们失手了 -那我们现在该干嘛?
They didn't make it. So what do we do now?

309
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,290
我管不着你怎么办
I don't care what you do,

310
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,400
我要开着车子走
but I'm taking the car.

311
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,700
什么?
What?

312
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,000
发生什么事了?
What the hell's going on?

313
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,600
把手放到头上 
Put your hands up on your head 

314
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,100
你 下来 到这里来
You come down here.

315
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,600
马上 
Now 

316
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,700
我们要找出是谁干的
We are going to find out who is behind this.

317
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,100
什么事?
What?

318
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,200
你是不是该告诉我发生什么了?
Were you going to let me know what the hell's going on?

319
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
林肯?
Lincoln?

320
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,900
我在听
I'm here.

321
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,400
很好 他们在哪?
Good. Where are they?

322
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,900
他们在我车上
They're in the car with me.

323
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,690
我听到警报声了
I heard the alarm.

324
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,990
警报前他们就跑得很远了
They were long gone before that thing went off.

325
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,390
好吧 如果他们开了个好头
Well, if they had such a head start,

326
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,690
你干嘛要磨蹭这么久?
why are you so far behind?

327
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,990
听着 你想让我开车的时候和你说话?
Listen, do you want me to talk to your drive?

328
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,500
让惠斯勒听电话
I want you to put Whistler on the phone.

329
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
什么?
What?

330
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,800
让他听电话
Put him on.

331
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,190
他在后备箱里
He's in the trunk.

332
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,790
不过 如果你强烈要求的话
But, if you feel that strongly about it,

333
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,990
我可以把他拖出来 你们俩可以稍微聊聊
I can pull over and you two can have a Nice little talk.

334
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,090
如果运气好的话 或许会有警察过来
If we're real lucky, maybe some cops will swing by.

335
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,290
我肯定警察也想和他谈谈的
I'm sure they'd like a word, too.

336
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,700
知道吗? 准备好放LJ
You know what? Just get LJ ready.

337
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,900
有人要逃出去 并且袭击了我的人
Whoever tried to escape assaulted one of my men.

338
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,490
众所周知 任何对巴拿马士兵
And, as you know, any attempt on the life

339
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,200
构成生命威胁的袭击
of a Panamanian soldier

340
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,500
都是死刑
warrants the death penalty.

341
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,400
是212号囚室的人干的
This attempt was made from cell #212.

342
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,890
如果没记错的话
And if memory serves,

343
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,500
那个囚室是你的人 对吧?
that cell belongs to members of your crew, no?

344
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,800
你
You.

345
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,600
你是那个送奶人吧
You are one of the Milkman's boys.

346
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
那是你的囚室吧?
Is it your cell?

347
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,700
我认为这是个肯定的答案
I'm going to take that as a yes.

348
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,700
我一直认为我们是亲密伙伴 你和我
I thought we were compadres, you and I.

349
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,390
我让你做你的生意 招你的妓
I let you run your business, have your whores.

350
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,890
没有水的时候
When you asked me for your own personal supply of water

351
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,590
还有停电的时候 我都满足你了吧?
when the lumbing went down, did I not provide it?

352
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,290
你让我切断电话
When you asked me to get rid

353
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,190
使他们无从非法运毒进来
of the phones, make them contraband,

354
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,900
以此来控制这里的交易
so you could control the trade in here,

355
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,400
我难道没满足你么?
did I not comply?

356
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,900
我做这一切都是为了你
I do all this for you.

357
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,990
而作为交易条件 我只要你为我
And in exchange, you were to do one thing

358
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,200
做一件事
for me.

359
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,300
管好这些人 
Keep these men in line 

360
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,300
也许我们看错人了
Maybe we just backed the wrong horse.

361
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,800
也许别人更适合这份工作
Perhaps there is another in here better suited for the job.

362
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,400
祝你好运 兄弟
Good luck, Bredda.

363
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,490
你知道我们中没人想
You know none of us tried

364
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,300
从那间牢房越狱
to break out of that cell.

365
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,800
我知道
I do.

366
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,990
但你一定知道只有一个人
Then you must know there's only one guy here

367
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,700
会愚蠢到想去试试
foolish enough to try.

368
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,900
很高兴看到你恢复如初
Nice to see you back in form.

369
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,400
谢谢
Thanks.

370
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,600
苏林斯 那有什么新消息吗?
Any news from Sullins?

371
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,800
他正在处理此事
He's working on it.

372
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
别人说什么都没关系
It doesn't matter what people say.

373
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,700
他们怎么说?
What do they say?

374
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,700
-你知道他们怎么说吗 -怎么说?
You know people, how they talk. About?

375
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,300
他们说是你杀了那些人
The men, the ones they say you killed.

376
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,700
这是真的吗?
Is it true?

377
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,900
如果是真的 你可以和我说说
Because, if it is, you can talk to about it.

378
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,600
真是这样吗?
Is that a fact?

379
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,190
是的 你可以相信我
Yes. You can trust me.

380
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,190
这么明说了吧
So let me get this straight.

381
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,100
苏林斯 让你来扮白脸?
Sullins sends you to be good cop?

382
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,890
不是这样的
That's not what this is.

383
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,490
其实从来就没有什么交易 对吗?
There never was a deal, was there?

384
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,890
苏林斯 只是想让我认罪
Sullins just wants me to confess

385
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,490
那他就有更多的指控理由遣送我回美国
so hcan bring me up on more charges back in the States.

386
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,590
交易很合理
The deal is legit.

387
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,490
那听证会本应该是
The hearing was supposed to be

388
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,390
我们离开监狱一小时后开的
an hour after we left the prison,

389
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,390
而我还在等
and I'm still waiting.

390
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,390
为什么你不把一切告诉我 费丽舍?
So why don't you just come clean, Felicia, huh?

391
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,500
看在以前的交情份上 怎样?
For old times' sake? How about it?

392
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,200
那你怎么不看在老交情份上配合呢?
How about you do me the same courtesy, Alex?

393
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,590
我不傻 我弟弟只是你们利用的工具
I'm not blind. My brother was a user.

394
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,090
我早就知道了
I can smell the stuff a mile away.

395
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,800
你不是想说我隐瞒什么吧?
Don't you accuse me of being the one who's hiding something.

396
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,600
我刚从广播中证实了
Hey, I just got confirmation from the radio.

397
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,990
狱警盘点过 监狱周围也被监控起来
The guards took a head count and they secured the perimeter.

398
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,300
今天没人逃出了过
No one made it out of there today.

399
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,500
苏克雷 怎么样了?
Sucre, what's going on?

400
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,590
看起来他们正准备离开
Looks like they're packing up.

401
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,290
不论你做什么
Whatever you do

402
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
不要让他们带走LJ 好吗?
don't let them take LJ, all right?

403
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,190
林肯? 林肯?
Linc? Linc?

404
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,100
苏克雷?
Sucre?

405
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,800
现在就离开
Get the hell out of here now.

406
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,000
小心 
Look out 

407

放她走
Let her go

409
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,190
把枪放下 否则我开枪杀死她 
Drop it or I swear to God I'll put a bullet in her head 

410
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,400
-现在放他走 你放他走 -爸 
Now you let him go You let him go now Dad 

411
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,190
LJ 我保证我会把你救出来
LJ, I'm going to get you out of this, I promise.

412
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,690
你对儿子许下一个实现不了的诺言吗?
You sure you want to make promises to your son you can't keep?

413
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,590
闭嘴
Watch your mouth.

414
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,400
我告诉你一个小秘密
I'll let you in on a little secret.

自从你选择
When you choose

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,190
这么解决问题 你就该知道
this line of work, you know it's all going to come down

417
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,600
会发生现在这一幕

让我查出究竟索纳监狱里发生了什么事情

让我和迈克谈谈

苏克雷

如你所知
Right, just so you know,

447

我没能逃出去
I wouldn't have gone through with it.

448

如果幸运的话 我们不会被发现
Lucky for us, we'll never have to find out.

449
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,600
那现在我们怎么做?
So what do we do now?

450
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,600
你知道你在哪里么 小子
You know where are you, boy?

451
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,990
我不是医生 但我可以猜猜看
Well, I'm no doctor, You but I'm just guessingboy.

继续说呀

你选个死法吧 老兄?
How you want it, brother?

456
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,000
快的还是慢的
Fast or slow?

457
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,200
我稍后会亲自动手
I think I later handle this one myself.

00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,300
你有孩子么 斯科菲尔德先生?
Do you have children, Mr. Scofield?

459

会有个非常乐观的家伙步你后尘
That's very optimistic for a man in your position.

461

我有五个孩子

我想在你们国家里
I believe in your country

465
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,500
他们管它叫"狼来了"
they call it,"The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

466
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,600
你知道那个故事么?
You know it?

467
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,690
你知道这个故事的寓意
Well, then you know the moral of that story

468
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,690
即使撒谎者说的是实话
is even when liars tell the truth,

469
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,400
他们也是不可信的
they can never be believed.

470
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
你命悬一线 小子
But your life's on the line, boy.

471
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,500
你想越狱么 斯科菲尔德先生?

不想
No.

473
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,490
你真准备越狱么?
Are you trying to break out of this prison?

474
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,790
我们都知道这是不可能的
We both know that's not possible.

475
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,190
-回答我 -你想让我说什么?
Answer me What do you want me to say?

476
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,290
我想让你告诉我事实 我要听实话
I want you to tell me the truth. I want to hear it.

477
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,400
-你想找个理由干掉我 -不是 小子
You want a reason to kill me. No, boy 

478
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,500
我已经有一个很好的理由干掉你了
I have good reason to kill you.

479
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,990
因为你 我已经不可能
Because of you, it's no longer possible

480
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,990
有力地管理这个监狱
for me to effectively govern this prison.

481
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,890
不管是否承认
Justified or not,

482
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,700
人们已经不服我了
the men no longer have faith in me.

483
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,490
我只能做一件事
That leaves only one thing for me to do

484
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,000
来保命
to guarantee my survival.

485
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,600
你可以着手越狱 斯科菲尔德先生
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.

486
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,200
你要带上我
And you're taking me with you.

487
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,190
我得到一些好消息
Well, I've got some good news

488

还有些更好的消息
and I've got some better news.

00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,200

491
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,600
更好的消息呢?
And the better news?

这张床上好好睡上一觉了
a really Nice sleep on that bed.

494
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,700
我还以为 
I thought that I 

495
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,990
我会听到可以乘飞机回美国的消息
After the hearing I was going to be on a plane back to the U.S.

496
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,590
你说过 
You said 

497
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,890
我是说过 你会回去的
I did, and you will be,

498
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,890
但是现在开听证会太晚了
but it's just too late to do the hearing now.

499
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,890
那是我们明早要做的第一件事情
We'll get to it first thing tomorrow.

500
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,300
-明早? -听起来不错
Tomorrow morning? Sounds about right.

501
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,690
拜托 可有什么方式方法
Please is there something, is there anything

502
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,690
能让事情进展顺利的吗?
that we can do to help speed things up?

503
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,490
当精灵满足了你的愿望
When a genie grants you a wish

504
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,990
你不会还摧他立马兑现吧
you don't really tell him to make it snappy.

505
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,190
这个听证会

506
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800

我进了全力
I have dropped everything

511
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,390
才同意她
to come down her

512
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,790
把你拉出火坑
and drag your sorry ass

513

促成此行

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,790
来帮助你敬仰的同事
to help your esteemed colleague.

519
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,300
我真可笑
I am just tickled.

520
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,500
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

521
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,390
有必要么?
Is that necessary?

522
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,200
把他铐起来
Cuff him.

523
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300

我不能再等了
I can't wait.

525

看见惠斯勒了吗?

526
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,700
没看见
No.

527
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,190
我尽心尽力工作
I spent my whole career

528
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,700
想方设法把坏人关在牢里
trying to keep bad people behind bars.

529
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,490
似乎通过我的工作
Like somehow by doing my job

530
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,800
我能让世界变得更美好
I was making the world a better place.

531
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,700
接着呢 
And then 

532
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,600
就发生了像莎拉这样的事
then you hear about what happened to someone like Sara.

533
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,690
现在看起来好像外面的坏人
Damn if it doesn't seem like there's more bad people

534
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,600
比这里还要多
out there than in here.

535
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,600
我警告过兄弟俩 如果他们失败了会怎样
I warned the brothers what would happen if they failed.

536
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,890
如果我现在给他们更多的时间
If I give them more time now, I may as well hand them

537
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,300
不如给他们一并捎上香烟和避孕套
a condom and a cigarette to go with it.

538
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,290
我大老远的来这儿
You know, I came all the way down here.

539
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,590
你最起码应该给我点儿意见
The least you could do is offer me an opinion.

540
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
我以为我们说好了你不会来这儿
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.

541
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,000
我以为你会在7天之内出来
And I thought you needed to be out in seven days.

542
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,700
我想知道这次耽搁会如何影响大局
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.

543
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,390
那不会好过 但是还有希望
Well, it won't be comfortable, but it will be possible.

544
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,390
谢谢你 詹姆斯
Oh, well, thank you, James,

545
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,390
但是那不会毁了我的信心
but that doesn't exactly ravage me with confidence.

546
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,490
那什么会?
And what would?

547
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,000
你坐上飞机逃之夭夭
Your ass on a plane.

548
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,200
再给我4天
Four more days.

549
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,500
如果我出去了 我还可以做到
If I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.

550
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,800
相信我 不会有事儿的
Trust me. It'll be fine.

551
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,400
我会告诉他们的
I'll let the brothers know.

552
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,800
格瑞成
Gretchen.

553
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,200
索菲亚呢 
About Sofia 

554
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,000
她很好
She's fine.

555
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,300
布鲁斯对她非常之好
Burrows is taking real good care of her.

556
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,200
好运 詹姆斯
Good luck, James.
