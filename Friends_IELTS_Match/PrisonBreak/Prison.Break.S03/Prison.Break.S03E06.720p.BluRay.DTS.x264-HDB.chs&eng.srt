你不了解我 我也不了解你
You don't know me, I don't know you,

不过你的任务是把我弄出去

你说你是在尼斯认识他的

是真的吗
Is that true?

36
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,000
你在说我是个骗子?
You calling me a liar now?

37
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,430
他说你满口谎话
He says you're full of it.

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,530
他说他从没做一个大使
He said he was never an ambassador.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,030
不 不是一个大使

我说"大使"

41

我曾在大使宾馆的服务台工作

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,880
我可以发誓 他曾在那干过几个月
I could've sworn he worked there for a few months.

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,580
谁知道呢 对吗
Who the hell knows, huh?

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,190
我经常磕药
I was high half the time.

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,150
这也是我被炒的原因
Kind of why I got fired.

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,360
是我在这儿的原因
Kind of why I'm in here.

47
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,810
他在尼斯做什么?
What was he up to in Nice?

48
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,390
怎么?
What?

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
你要出书吗
You writing a book?

我们3点13走 还有三小时又

41分钟 但我们还没办法进禁入区

我会搞定的

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,870
-只是我得先查探一下 -那监狱围栏呢?
I just need to check it out first. And the fence?

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,480
你那个掘墓人朋友只洒过一次药水
Your grave digger friends only sprayed the thing once,

55
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,180
我可不希望今天我被上电刑
And I'd just assume not get electrocuted today.

56
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,380
苏克雷多洒一次会让我更有安心点吗 是的
Would I feel better if Sucre had sprayed the fence again? Yes.

57
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,400
这可能吗 不
Is that an option? No.

58
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,660
除非他又有进来的理由
Unless he had another reason to be there.

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,530
你要做什么?
What are you going to do?

60
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,630
杀个人好让他进来洒药水?
Kill someone to get more spray on the fence?

61
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,310
我倒想杀了你 如果这能帮我们逃出去的话
I'd think about killing you if it helped us get out of here today.

62
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,520
知道什么能帮我们逃出去吗
You know what'll help us get out of here?

63
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,530
一把梯子
A ladder.

64
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,640
迈克 
Michael 

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,680
我们逃出去后要去哪儿?
where are we gonna go once we get through that fence?

66
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,300
去弄把梯子来
Just get me a ladder.

67
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,490
这张吊床比以前那个短
This hammock's shorter than the last one.

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,110
那我们得弄点别的东西来接长它
Well, we might need something to extend it.

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,870
好了 我来想办法
All right, I'll take care of it.

70
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,550
我从没去过尼斯
I've never been to Nice.

71
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,290
听说那儿很美
I hear it's beautiful.

72
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,800
我怎么知道
I wouldn't know.

73
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,610
我不管这个人是不是认识你
I don't care if this guy knows you or not.

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,780
我在意的是
But what I do care about is

75
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,420
他很明显一直在盯着你
his apparent fixation with watching you at all times.

我很好奇原因
I wonder why.

92

你该死的有什么毛病?
What the hell is your problem?

93
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,650
听着 我不想和你上床 明白吗
Look, I just don't want to have sex with you, okay?

94
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,460

我们怎么肯定他们还活着?

他们是我愿做这事的唯一原因啊

现在你 你却为这个人做担保?

听着 如果我在今天中午2:30之前
Listen, if I don't see pictures of LJ and Sara by 2:30

131
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,120
看不到LJ和莎拉的照片
this afternoon,

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
我哪里都不会去
I'm not going anywhere.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,310
我找不到美国产的奶酪

没事 很好
Yeah. It's perfect.

136
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,910
几年前 我在摩苏尔打仗

137

我被敌人俘虏了
And I was taken prisoner.

138
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,600
过了几个漫长的晚上后
A few nights later,

139
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,160
我听到了美军直升机的声音
I could hear the sound of U.S. Army helicopters.

140
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,900
越来越近
Two clicks and closing.

141
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,350
我的手当时是被绑着的
My hands were still tied behind my back,

142
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,920
但我还是逃了
and I I ran.

143
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,960
我当时没有想到
It didn't occur to me

144
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,050
如果这是一次营救任务
that if this was a rescue mission,

145
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,690
那么敌人也会听到直升机声音的
my captors could hear the choppers.

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,710
我没有想到
It didn't occur to me

147
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,640
这次的任务其实是人质交换
that this was actually a hostage exchange,

148
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,320
但是
and that

149
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,320
我的逃跑会被视为
jumping would be viewed

150
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,420
敌对行为
as a hostile act.

151
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,420
我很快又被抓起来了
I got recaptured immediately.

152
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,410

Six Rangers died

153
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,180
枪战
in the firefight.

154

接下来的三个星期 
And for the next three weeks 

155
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,360
这么说吧
Let's just say

156
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,860
人都是畜牲
men are pigs.

157
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,070
我们丑话说在前头
Let's be clear.

158
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,690
这是一次交换
This is an exchange.

159
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,410
不要逞能
If you don't try to be a hero,

160
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,240
这样你和你爸爸都不会有事
you and your father will be okay.

161
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,960
-明白了吗? -明白
Okay? Okay.

162
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,290
很好
Good.

163
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,200
吃吧
Eat.

164
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,240
诺曼? 诺曼? 
Norman? Norman? 

165
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,010
你该知道
As you can imagine,

166
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,300
他喜欢勒齐
he prefers Lechero.

167
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,340
诺曼?
Norman?

168
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,140
他不管你交不交保护费都会杀了你
He kills you before or after he does your taxes.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,570
他杀你可不需要理由
He Kills you when he pleases.

170
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,390
我口渴了
I'm feeling thirsty.

171
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,620
你为什么不帮我们拿点喝的 小子
Why don't you go fix us something to drink, boy?

172
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,270
也许你还没接到通知
Maybe you ain't got the memorandum,

173
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,860
我已经被提升了
but I've been promoted.

174
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,140
小子
Boy.

175
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,910
你刚才对我说什么?
What did you say to me?

176
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,940
有什么事吗
What's the problem?

177
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,600
有人打肿脸充胖子
Stumpy herand his mouth.

178
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,620
就是这个问题
That's the problem.

179
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,340
我现在就要和他出去把问题解决
I'm calling him out right now 

180
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,110
我会和他谈谈 你出去
I'll talk to him. Leave.

181
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:50,990
这事没完
This isn't over.

182
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,170
都出去 
Leave 

183
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,760
我们只是 
We was just, uh 

184
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,850
不 不
No, no, no.

185
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,430
你欠我个情
The favor you owe me 

186
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,890
你发现了什么吗
What have you found out?

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,810
这种事情是要时间的
A thing like this takes time.

188
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,380
我不可能走到他面前直接问
I can't just walk up to them and say,"Hey, whoever's been

189
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,640
谁背叛了勒齐请举手
betraying Lechero, raise your hand."You know?

190
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,960
我让你在这里当我的耳线
I asked you to be my ears in this prison,

191
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,340
你什么料都收不到? 
and you hear nothing? 

192
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,450
我只知道每一次我坐下来准备
All I know is every time I try and sit down and begin

193
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,230
了解点什么的时候 萨米总是扯开话题
sussing things out, Sammy always changes the subject.

194
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,860
我不是说他就是叛徒 但 
Not that I'm saying he's the guy, but 

195
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,390
我不想听你的理论
I don't want to hear your theories.

196
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,390
我要的是结论
I want results.

197
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,350
情况还好吗
Is everything okay?

198
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,230
-詹姆斯怎么样? -是的 他很好
Is James all right? Yeah, he's fine.

199
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,220
这东西哪里来的?
Where is this from?

200
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,110
乌瑞伯 在波德格的
Uribe's, the roadside

201
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,910
路边 就几公里远
Bodega a few kilometers away.

202
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
如果我想你去辩认一个警卫
If I needed you to ID a specific guard 

203
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,320
哨塔的警卫 你能做得到吗?
a tower guard could you do it?

204
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,820
我只是不想被抓起来
I just don't want to get busted.

205
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
到底能不能做到?
Could you do it or not?

206
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,220
可以
Yes.

207
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
-林肯? -是的
Lincoln? Yeah.

208
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,920
-什么事? -我需要点帮助
What is it? I need something.

209
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,210
蒂博格也干不了什么坏事的 老兄
Teodoro's harmless, man.

210
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,820
-他是一个 小丑 -一个该死的小丑
He's a he's clown. He's a dead clown.

211
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,610
老兄 我不会到处说
Hey, man, I wasn't going to say anything,

212
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,120
但是 昨晚
but, uh, last night,

213
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,820
我在找扑克的时候 你猜怎么着
I was looking for my playing cards and guess what?

214
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
我发现了这个
I found these.

215
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,120
你竟然瞒着我
You're holding out on me.

216
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,810
喜欢都拿去
Take'em.

217
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,920
口感很差
They taste nasty.

218
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,120
老兄 你找不到再好的雪茄了
Man, you cannot get a better cigar than this.

219
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,220
你从谁那里拿的? 奥古斯特?
Where'd you get these? Augusto?

220
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,010
他要给我 我也阻止不了
I can't make him stop sending them in to me,

221
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
不过我可不是他的人 你明白吗?
but I don't work for him, you understand?

222
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
你确定不介意?
You sure you don't mind?

223
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
我在这附近
I was in the neighborhood.

224
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,920
我那么老远过来探望我?
You came all this way to visit?

225
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,920
我来是想把你弄出来
I came to get you out of here.

226
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,110
我能在48小时之后把你转去Schaum
I can have you in Schaum Correctional Facility

227
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
的监禁中心
in 48 hours.

228
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,520
在圣路易斯
In St. Louis.

229
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,410
苏林斯希望把你关在相对戒备森严的地方
Sullins wanted a medium security,

230
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
但我说服了他
but, uh, talked him down.

231
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,420
他给我什么的方案作为交易?
What sort of deal is he getting me?

232
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,020
25年?
25 years?

233
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
终身监禁?
Life?

234
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,310
上级给予我们很大的让步
The director's giving us a lot of latitude

235
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,210
以此交换你在政府对林肯・布鲁斯
in exchange for testimony against the government

236
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,820
这次阴谋事件上的证词
in the Lincoln Burrows conspiracy.

237
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
那么
So 

238
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,620
8年怎么样?
how does eight years sound?

239
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,920
苏林斯安排好
Soon as Sullins finishes up,

240
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,320
我们准备好车 
we can have a van ready 

241
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,220
我不接受
I don't think so.

242
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,020
什么?
What?

243
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,310
谢谢你们的努力
I appreciate the effort,

244
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,320
你的努力 但是 我不能忍受被关押8年
your effort, but, um, I can't do eight years.

245
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,020
你现在最起码要坐10年
You're doing ten now.

246
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,720
政府现在需要你做点事
The government is calling in some favors.

247
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,310
一旦你回到美国 如果你不合作
Once you're in the U.S., if you don't cooperate,

248
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,410
他们会起诉你所有的犯罪行为
they're going to charge you with everything.

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,320
那可包括多起谋杀案的
That's multiple homicide counts.

250
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,310
你不答应这交易
Without this deal,

251
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,620
你一辈子都要在牢里了
you are gonna be in prison for the rest of your life.

252
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,720
谢谢你们的努力
I appreciate the effort,

253
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,420
你的努力
your effort.

254
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
但我不能
But I can't.

255
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
阿历克斯
Alex.

256
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,300
我们行动的时候 如果 
While we're getting out of here, and 

257
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,500
如果我不能成功
if I don't make it,

258
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,600
你能答应我一定将这个给我女朋友吗
will you make sure this gets to my girlfriend?

259
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,700
好的
All right.

260
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,490
你知道的 如果你 我也可以帮你这么做
You know, uh I could do the same for you.

261
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
把这个绑紧了
Tie an anchor bend there.

262
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,490
我只是提一下
I was just offering.

263
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,600
你知道吗 如果我逃不出去
You know what, if I'm the one who doesn't make it,

264
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,200
如果你真心想帮我
and you really want to do me a favor,

265
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,800
就是坚持与对方的谈判
just hold up your end of the bargain.

266
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,900
我会尽我所能的
I'll do everything I can.

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,100
我希望那是真的
I hope that's true.

268
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,500
那个结是从哪来的?
How's that knot coming?

269
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,400
你看
There.

270
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
我合格了吗?
Did I pass your test?

271
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
我告诉过你我是个渔民
I told you I'm a fisherman.

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,790
进展如何?
Where are we?

273
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,890
我发现了一个能让我们到达禁入区的牢房
I found a cell that'll get us into no-man's-land.

274
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,090
比从我的旧牢房到达围墙要远一些
It's a longer run to the fence than my old one,

275
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,300
但必须得从那走
but it's gonna have to do.

276
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,000
哪一间? 谁住那?
Which one? Who liveshere?

277
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,700
帕波乔还有萨米
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.

278
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,600
听着 我知道你在想什么
Look, I know what you're thinking,

279
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,390
但这是第二层唯一另一间
but it's the only other cell on the second floor

280
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,990
可以不被岗哨发现直达围墙的牢房
with a direct line to the fence, where we won't be seen

281
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,590
我们怎么保证
the other tower guards. And how do we

282
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,990
他们不会在那出现?
guarantee that they won't be there?

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,990
到两点时 每个人都会到操场
By 2:00, everyone should be out in the courtyard

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,800
观看午餐足球比赛
for the lunchtime soccer game.

285
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,100
你确信那还没开始?
You sure it hasn't started already?

286
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,600
某人不经过决斗来解决问题
Someone went outside the ring to settle a dispute.

287
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,990
现在 谁破坏了这个规矩
Now, anyone who affronts our justice system

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,100
谁就要被依此受惩罚
in this way must be punished.

289
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,500
现在 我知道那懦夫不敢吭声
Now, I know the coward won't come forward.

290
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
但如果有人有关于此事的信息
But if anyone has information about this shameful act,

291
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,600
告诉我
I demand to know.

292
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,790
-走吧 穆多 -干吗?
Let's go, Menudo. Why?

293
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,900
勒齐想找你 快走
Lechero wants you. Move your ass.

294
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,690
每天我看你在院子里呆着
Now, every day I see you out in the yard,

295
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,790
玩你的美国运动
you play your American sports

296
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,090
穿着你的美国球衣
and wear your American clothes.

297
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,090
我觉得从你来之后
I don't think I've heard you

298
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
没你说过一句西班牙语
speak one word of Spanish since you've been here.

299
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,000
我想练习英文
I like to practice my English.

300
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,300
没什么不好
And why shouldn't you?

301
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
美国是个伟大的国家
America is a great nation.

302
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,190
"一个不可分割的国家 自由与公正属于所有人"
"One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

303
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,100
没错吧?
Is that right?

304
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,390
对
Yes.

305
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,500
没错
Yes.

306
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,500
对所有人都要公平
Justice for all.

307
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,200
你我都一样
Justice for you and justice for me.

308
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,300
而对 
And justice for 

309
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,700
那个在院子里杀了布朗齐多的凶手也要公平
whoever killed that blanquito in the yard.

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,300
我知道你为什么在那一言不发
Now, I know why you didn't say anything out there.

311
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,690
但你每天都在那玩恶心的美国游戏
But you play your silly American games all day long,

312
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,200
就在尸体被发现的楼梯前面
right in front of the stairs where the body was found.

313
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,500
现在 如果你不告诉我你看到了什么
Now, if you don't tell me what you saw,

314
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,900
会有你好看的
there will be consequences.

315
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,100
我 我看到一个人走进楼梯间
Well, I-I saw one person go into the stairwell.

316
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,100
好像一分钟之后 我听到争吵声
A-And then maybe a minute later, I heard an argument.

317
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,700
你看到谁了?
Who did you see?

318
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,100
那么在我们松开绳子后
So after we tie the cord off 

319
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,590
我们切断栏杆 打通窗户
we dig out the bar, we pop open the grate,

320
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,690
然后我们就逃出去 没错吧迈克?
and we're, and we're down, right, Michael?

321
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,790
有人想说说
Does anyone want to say anything

322
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,500
我们刚看到的东西吗?
about what we just saw out there?

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,890
说什么?
What is there to say?

324
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,290
首先 一小时前
Well, for starters, an hour ago,

325
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,590
你说也许我们得杀个人
you say maybe we should kill someone

326
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,690
然后就有人被杀了
and then someone gets killed.

327
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,290
我没说过 而那
I didn't say that, and this is exactly

328
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,590
就是我们现在必须关注的
what we should be focusing on right now.

329
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,890
让我们花几个小时
Let's spend a couple of hours worrying

330
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,200
担心在这鬼地方的另一具尸体
about another dead body in this hellhole.

331
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,700
你们要干吗?
What do you want?

332
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,400
你们要干吗?
What are you doing?

333
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,690
勒齐想见你
Lechero wants to see you.

334
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,990
我什么信息都没有
I don't have any information.

335
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,400
他不需要信息
He doesn't want information.

336
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,700
他需要招供
He wants a confession.

337
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,600
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

338
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,000
他说的没错 他是无辜的
Listen to him; he's innocent.

339
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,700
那你想招供?
You want to confess?

340
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,400
那你来代替他啊
You can easily switch places.

341
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,190
也许现在我们得开始担心
Maybe now we should start worrying

342
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,900
那个真正的杀手了吧?
about who the real killer is, huh?

343
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,590
是啊 但在这里
Yeah, but in this place,

344
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,090
也许有一百个人在嫌疑名单上
there could be a hundred people on that list.

345
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,790
除了我觉得在死者脖子底部
Except I'm thinking a single stab wound

346
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,100
有个刀疤 而那伤口一看就是高手干的 阿历克斯
to the base of the neck looks pretty professional, Alex.

347
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,690
我当时正有人探视 老兄
I was in visitation, Kojak.

348
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,300
什么让你这么肯定惠斯勒没杀人?
And what makes you so sure that Whistler didn't do it?

349
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,090
他可是与他有纠葛的人
He's the one that had the run-in with the guy.

350
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,590
不可能 他不会为这事去冒险
No, he's got too much to lose.

351
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,690
惠斯勒出局了 即使不是现在
Whistler's gone, and if not now,

352
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,490
也快了 所以就剩我们俩
he probably will be soon, so it's you and me.

353
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,800
没有所谓的我们俩
There's no you and me.

354
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,500
我们不会丢下他逃走的
We're not leaving here without him.

355
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,090
在两个小时内 我将要爬出窗户 翻过那围墙
In two hours, I'm going out that window and through that fence.

356
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,890
是吗? 很好
Oh, yeah? Yeah, that's right.

357
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,190
你想跑哪去 阿历克斯?
And where are you going to go to, Alex?

358
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,290
哪都去不了
Anywhere but here.

359
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,700
只有一条路能出去
There's only one road out,

360
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,990
树林里有24小时不间断巡逻
and the jungle is under constant patrol by police 24-7,

361
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,100
那我再问一次 你想跑哪去阿历克斯?
so, again, where are you going to go to, Alex?

362
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,200
3点13分 我会离开的
3:13, I'm gone.

363
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,000
我说过我对此一无所知
I told you I know nothing about this.

364
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
我不应该 
I shouldn't 

365
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,090
我不该被带这来
I shouldn't be here.

366
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,700
我能向你保证 我没杀人
I can promise you I, I did not kill that man.

367
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,500
有人看到你走下楼梯
Someone saw you go down the staircase.

368
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,900
楼梯 还有什么证据吗?
Stai.. is there any other proof?

369
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,500
我的人会找到证据的
My men will find something.

370
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
那你看到我身上有凶器吗?
Well, do you see a weapon on me?

371
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,090
我才不期望能在你身上看到凶器
I didn't expect to see a weapon on you.

372
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,890
那他们怎么不去找那个?
Well, w-why don't they look for that?

373
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,590
找到凶器 就找到了真正的杀手
You find that, you'll find the real killer.

374
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,490
或者也许他们找到了你埋凶器的地方
Or maybe they find where you planted it.

375
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,990
你是说我在栽赃?
So, what, I'm framing someone?

376
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,190
那你想过
Well, did it ever occur to you

377
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,590
也许有人在设计陷害我? 谁会这样做?
that someone might be framing me? Who would bother?

378
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,690
你知道我被关在这的原因
You know the reason I'm here.

379
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,890
你知道我有强大的敌人
You know I have powerful enemies.

380
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,200
你认为我的判断会被市长的朋友左右吗?
You think my judgment is swayed by the mayor's friends?

381
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,900
坐下吧
Sit your ass down.

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
当我13岁时
When I was 13,

383
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,500
我妈妈在一个有钱人家当仆人
my mother worked for a wealthy man as a maid

384
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,900
直到有一天 
until one day 

385
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,300
她一个人呆在房子里
 she was alone in the house 

386
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
和他待在一起 
with him and he 

387
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,700
所有人都知道他干了什么
Everybody knew what he did,

388
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,300
但是由于他是富人
but because he was rich

389
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,500
而我们是移民
and we were immigrants,

390
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,800
警察连报案都不接受
the police wouldn't even take a report.

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,400
然后 一周之后
So, a week later,

392
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
为了接近他
to gain access through his gates,

393
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,700
我装扮成送牛奶的――一个勒齐
I dressed as a milkman a Lechero 

394
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,300
我确保 他得到其应有的惩罚
and I made sure that fair punishment was rendered.

395
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,900
现在你来说说我会怎么偏袒富人
Now you want to tell me how I favor the rich.

396
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,500
我知道这里的规矩 我也尊重它
I understand the rules here, and I respect them.

397
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
为什么这么急着下结论?
But why the rush to judgment?

398
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,790
有哪个条款规定你必须在
Is there a rule saying you must convict a suspect

399
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
10分钟内找到嫌疑犯吗
within ten minutes?

400
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
没有
No.

401
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,100
我们有大把时间慢慢研究
We have all the time in the world.

402
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

403
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,700
当然 现在我哪也不会去
Now, obviously, I'm not going anywhere.

404
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,900
如果你还想聊聊 我就在我的单间里
If you need to talk again, I'm gonna be in my cell.

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,900
不用了
No.

406
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,500
你只能坐在这把椅子上
You'll be right here in this chair.

407
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,140
你到底想要做什么?
What the hell do you want?

408
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,150
我不喜欢你
I don't like you.

409
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,050
当然也没有尊重你
I certainly don't respect you.

410
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,640
够了 你在伤害我的感觉
Stop. You're hurting my feelings.

411
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,740
你也知道你能干什么
I've seen at you're capable of,

412
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,950
但我不得不承认
but I got to say

413
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,650
我从来没想过你会杀人
I never pegged you as a murderer.

414
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,450
你认为是我杀了帝格?
You think I killed Tyge?

415
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,540
我今早在院子里看见你们俩了
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning.

416
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,840
我只是想跟他交朋友
I was trying to be Nice to him.

417
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,940
是他先和我过不去的
He started with me.

418
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,450
如果不是你杀的 那会是谁?
Well, if you didn't kill him, who did?

419
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,650
不是我
Not me.

420
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,850
别嘴硬了 布拉德
Come on, Brad.

421
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,850
除了你以为谁还会想要他的小命?
Who wanted him dead besides you?

422
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,450
你当真以为是我杀了那个呆瓜?
You really think I killed that frog?

423
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,050
我拿着枪口对着你多少次了?
How many times have I had you at gunpoint?

424
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,150
你以为我不想开枪?
You think I didn't want to pull that trigger?

425
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,950
天啊 
Hell 

426
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,450
我连自杀都没办法
I can't even kill myself.

427
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,450
你知道有谁看见惠斯勒从这楼梯下去吗?
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler go down the stairway?

428
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,250
我们才出来1分钟
We only been out here a minute.

429
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,540
那么快点了
Well, hurry up, then.

430
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,950
惠斯勒死的越早
The sooner Whistler dies,

431
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,650
那我就能越早给你鸡爪
the sooner I can give you the chicken foot,

432
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,040
也许你更喜欢给我鸡爪
or if you prefer, you can give me the chicken foot 

433
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,150
像个男人一样试试
you know, try and go out like a man.

434
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,550
随便选 你今天得和我决斗
Either way, you're getting in the ring with me today.

435
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,650
Zylafol 用来麻醉狗的
Zylafol. It's used to anesthetize dogs.

436
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,950
2滴 守卫就会在一个小时内昏迷
Two drops, and the guard should be out within an hour.

437
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,250
我还以为惠斯勒的女朋友会参与行动
I was expecting Whistler's girlfriend to join you.

438
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,040
她在哪 转角的车里?
Where is she? Around the corner in the car?

439
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,150
她来找过我
She came to me.

440
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,740
我不介意她帮助你
I don't mind that she's helping you.

441
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,350
我介意的是你对我保密
I mind that you kept it from me.

442
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,040
有什么关系呢
What difference does it make?

443
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,140
我是说 我们明天就散伙了 对吧?
I mean, we're done by tomorrow, right?

444
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,050
别再耍花样了林肯
No more surprises, Lincoln.

445
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,250
干吗? 说出来
What? Say it.

446
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,350
你能给我更多莎拉的照片吗?
Can you get any more pictures of Sara?

447
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,950
活着的? 当然不
Alive? No.

448
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,150
你没告诉他
You didn't tell him.

449
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,050
你没告诉迈克 莎拉已经死了
You didn't tell Michael that Sara's dead.

450
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,550
到底能不能弄出照片来?
Can we get pictures or not?

451
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,940
当然我们可以拼张出来
I'm sure we can cobble something together,

452
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,750
真聪明 你竟然没告诉你弟弟
but smart move not telling your brother.

453
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,650
他似乎对我不怎么信任
He seems a little sensitive to me.

454
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,040
这就是交换地点 LJ和我会那等待
This is the exchange point LJ and I will be waiting.

455
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,640
你迈克和惠斯勒
You, Michael and Whistler will meet us there.

456
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,850
一切顺利的话 你9点就能跟你儿子团聚了
Everything goes as planned, you'll have your son back by 9:00.

457
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,550
林肯?

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,750
是哪个?
Which one is it?

460
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,240
不知道 我猜是高的那个
I don't know, I think it's the taller one.

461
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,550
-另外个一直在喝橘子汁 -你确定吗?
The other one is always drinking orange juice. You sure?

462
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,040
我想是的 不过不大肯定
I think so, I'm not completely sure,

463
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:52,840
他们看起来都差不多
but they all look the same. Hey 

464
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,840
我们一直在找你
We've been trying to reach you.

465
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,250
索纳里面又有一具尸体
There's another dead body in Sona.

466
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,040
我是在 
I was just 

467
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,650
快来吧

468
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,150
你要咖啡吗
You want a coffee?

469

470

请给我一杯橘子汁和一杯咖啡
One orange juice and one coffee, please.

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,650
走路看着点 
Watch where you're going 

473
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,540
这 看着 
Here, look, uh 

474
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,140
这是我伙伴的 请拿去吧
this is a buddy's, please.

475
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,450
不好意思 我坚持
Please, I insist.

476
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,450
胡塔多队长 给你重新弄了杯咖啡
Captain Hurtado Here's a new coffee.

477
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,040
不是的
No really.

478
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,950
托马 托马
Toma, Toma .

479
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,950
托马
Toma.

480
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,050
谢谢
Gracias.

481
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,750
伙计 我 
Man, I 

482
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,650
还是谢谢了
Thank you anyway.

483
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,240
不好意思 先生
Excuse me, Se?or.

484
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,950
我想去索纳
I need to go to Sona.

485
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,840
我 
I 

486
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,640
-我的车没气了 -抱歉
my car's run out of gas and Sorry.

487
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,940
我开的方向不对
I'm-I'm heading in the wrong, wrong direction.

488
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,440
我真的得到索纳去
I really need to go to Sona.

489
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,050
我可以载你一程
I'll give you a ride.

490
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,350
来吧
Come along.

491
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,450
谢谢你
Thank you.

492
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,250
小心点 别穿帮了
Watch the lid.

493
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,450
请接受我的哀悼
My condolences.

494
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,540
你终于有了个朋友 但他现在又要挂了
You finally make a friend, and now he's about to die.

495
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,650
真丢脸啊
Damn shame.

496
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,750
你可以阻止的
You can stop it, you know.

497
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,840
也许你还没注意到
If you hadn't noticed,

498
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,550
我的位置能让我获得不少事情
my position enables me to hear things.

499
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,750
我在听
I'm listening.

500
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,840
勒齐所拥有的唯一证据
The only proof Lechero's got is

501
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,740
就是你们下了那个楼梯 对吧
that your man went down that staircase, t?

502
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,840
如果你有更有说服力的证据呢?
What if you had more compelling

503
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,450
我没有
evidence? Well, I don't.

504
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,650
但如果你有呢 
But if you did 

505
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,440
你在建议我伪造点什么?
You're suggesting I make something up?

506
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,240
如果它能让你良心过的去的话
If it makes your conscience feel better,

507
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,740
然后嫁祸到某个应该得到惩罚的人的头上
then blame it on somebody who deserves it.

508
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,840
某个曾经杀了人
Someone who's killed before

509
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,740
但并未得到惩罚的凶手
and gone unpunished.

510
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,050
对啊 比如你
Yeah, like you maybe.

511
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,450
萨米
Sammy.

512
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,740
你想要我告诉勒齐
You want me to tell Lechero

513
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,450
他的左右手罪有应得?
that his right hand man should die?

514
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,550
你不需要要求勒齐低头
You don't tell Lechero squat.

515
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,140
勒齐知道
Lechero knows

516
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,550
这是萨米的戒指
this is Sammy's ring.

517
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,940
如果你把它丢到
If you drop it

518
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,340
楼梯上的那摊血里
in the blood by the staircase,

519
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,340
然后对勒齐大喊你的发现
then yell up to Lechero what you've found 

520
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,840
那这整个
the whole entire

521
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,840
监狱都会听说有明确证据
prison will hear clear-cut evidence

522
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,250
证明萨米有罪
of Sammy's guilt.

523
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,650
勒齐除了遵守规定以外别无他法
Lechero will have no choice but to comply.

524
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,950
这就是索纳
This is Sona.

525
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,140
没啥好担心的
Don't worry your pretty little head about it.

526
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,640
你只要把戒指放进血泊中
All you have to do is drop the ring in the blood

527
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,040
说是萨米干的
and say it was Sammy.

528
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,250
剩下的就交给我
I'll take care of the rest.

529
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,850
想救你朋友的命么?
You want to save your friend's life?

530
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,350
那有人就得死
Someone else has to die.

531
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,600
跟帝格解释下为什么你不同意
Explain your disagreement with this Tyge man.

532
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,890
我听说
From what I just heard,

533
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,100
他知道你的一些事?
he knew something about you?

534
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,800
他以为他知道我的一些事
He thought he knew something about me.

535
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,390
时机和动机
Opportunity and a motive.

536
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,500
这些可不妙啊
That's not a good combination.

537
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,990
你也一定知道了
You must know there's discontent

538
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,300
大家对你的管理心存不满
from many prisoners over how you run Sona.

539
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,500
现在不是攻击我的时候
Now would not be a good time to insult me.

540
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,490
你杀了我 得到了你要的正义
you execute me, you get your swift justice

541
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,790
你或许可以安抚大家
and you may placate the masses.

542
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,400
但当他们最终发现谁做的 
But when they find out who really did it 

543
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,900
他们就会说 你杀了个无辜的人
they will know you killed an innocent man.

544
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,600
你还没回答我的问题
You're still not answering my question.

545
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,190
你和帝格到底怎么回事?
What was your disagreement with Tyge?

546
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,990
他是个爱管闲事的人
He was a nosy guy.

547
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
他来干涉我的事
He got into my business.

548
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,190
我肯定他也去管了别人的闲事
I'm sure he did the same with someone else,

549
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
所以被杀了
and that's what got him killed.

550
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,290
那你是承认你和他有矛盾了?
Would you just admit that you had an argument?

551
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,200
这里是监狱
This is prison.

552
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,390
如果有人对我横加指责 我当然受不了
If someone makes false accusations, I can't back down.

553
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,690
这点你应该清楚
You must respect that.

554
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,600
我已经回答了你的每个问题
Look, I've answered every one of your questions.

555
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,490
我已经尽全力澄清了
I've acquitted myself the best that I can.

556
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,400
要怎样你才相信我
Now what can I do to make you trust me?

557
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,700
这年头 我谁都不信
I don't trust anybody today.

558
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
一定很多人对你说过 但我还是要说 
You must get this a lot, but 

559
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,400
你真美
You're very pretty.

560
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,700
非常非常美
I mean very, very pretty.

561
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,600
怎么了?
What's the trouble?

562
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,500
可能你不知道 不过 
You probably don't know this, but 

563
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,700
有一种为特别的人
There is a special visitation

564
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,400
准备的特殊探视
for special people 

565
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,700
我可以安排你进入索纳
I could arrange for you to go inside Sona

566
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,200
和你的爱人享受点二人世界
and have some private time with your love.

567
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
要想进去
And everything you would need

568
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,100
你所要做的
to assure your entry

569
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,700
都能在这辆车里完成
could be performed right here in this car.

570
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
是啊
Yeah.

571
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,100
照片到手了
We have the picture.

572
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,500
看上去怎样
How does it look?

573
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,100
很像莎拉
It looks like Sara.

574
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,590
我半小时后到索纳
I'll be at Sona in half an hour.

575
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,000
停车场等我
Meet me in the parking lot.

576
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,000
没出什么岔子吧
Is everything okay?

577
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,700
等下 等下 等下
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

578
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,900
难道你不爱你的男人?
Don't you love your man?

579
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,090
我不知你是否知道 但是
I don't know if you know this, but

580
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,700
诺曼脾气很暴躁
Norman has a terrible temper.

581
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,700
诺曼? 诺曼・圣约翰?
Norman? Norman St. John?

582
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,000
是
Si?

583
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,590
你是勒齐的女人?
You're one of Lechero's girls?

584
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,500
是
Si?

585
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,300
我等着呢
I'm waiting.

586
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,500
守卫这有点麻烦
There was a complication with the guard.

587
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,300
给他下药有点麻烦?
Complications drugging the guard?

588
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,900
是 不过还有希望
Yeah, but it's been taken care of.

589
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,190
好 不错
Well, that's encouraging,

590
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,490
你们现在下药干吗
but why are you drugging the guard

591
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,200
不是晚上才行动么?
now when you're escaping tonight?

592
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,790
要那么久才会有药物才会起效
Well, it takes that long for the drugs to work 

593
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,100
药物1小时候就起效 我告诉过你
They take an hour, like I told you.

594
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,600
阿历克斯 
Alex 

595
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,400
你的表现可越来越差了 阿历克斯
You are getting sloppy,Alex.

596
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,340
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

597
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,310
这是跟我开玩笑吗 -我很久以前就
Is this is a joke? I stopped hiding

598
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,240
不再把东西藏在床底下了
things under my mattress a long time ago.

599
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,250
你在我床下找到的?
Did you find that under my mattress?

600
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,160
如果是的话 那也是别人故意放在那里的
Cause if you did somebody put it there.

601
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,930
这么跟我解释可说不通
You're gonna have to do better than that.

602
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,520
是吗
Really?

603
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,630
你在刀上发现我的指纹了吗
Did you find some fingerprints on it?

604
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,700
啊? 还是你发现一些我的纤维了
Huh? Did you get some fibers?

605
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,920
你打算怎么做? 把它交给索纳的鉴证室检验一下?
What are you gonna do take it to the Sona crime lab?

606
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,710
他们认定是惠斯勒
They got Whistler nailed

607
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,130
就因为他在错误的时间去过这个楼道
for walking into the wrong stairwell.

608
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,140
我想凭这个
I'm thinking this is enough

609
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,640
就足够可以让你们俩换个处境了
to get you guys to switch places.

610
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,650
明白我的意思么?
You know what I mean?

611
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,340
什么意思? 这又能证明什么呢?
What does that mean, huh? What does that prove?

612
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,250
证明了一切
It proves everything 

613
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,250
我确定勒齐也一定这么想
I'm gonna make sure Lechero thinks so, too.

614
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:00,950
迈克
Michael.

615
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,540
迈克我没杀他
Michael, I did not kill that man.

616
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,450
我没杀他
I did not kill the man.

617
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,850
怎么了?
What's, what's going on?

618
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,950
没事吧?
Is everything okay?

619
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,150
你想干吗?
What the hell you doing?

620
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,740
这是为什么?
What's that for?

621
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,850
你爸爸想逞英雄
Your father tried to be a hero.

622
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,650
不 不
No, no.

623
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,340
求你了 求你了
Hey, please, please.

624
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,050
求你了
Please.

625
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,240
求你了 不 停下 停下
Please, no, stop Stop 

626
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,340
等我切断你的脊髓 再弄断几根末梢神经
Once I cut the spinal cord and the sever nerve endings,

627
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,340
你就什么都感觉不到了
you won't feel a thing.

628
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,040
不 不
No, no.

629
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,050
不 不
No, no 

630
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,440
苏珊对不起
Susan, I'm sorry.

631
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,850
我们不是故意的
We didn't mean to do that.

632
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,950
爸爸 他们要杀我
Dad, they're gonna kill me.

633
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,350
什么 LJ?
What? LJ?

634
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,250
他们要割断我的喉咙
Yeah, they got a knife to my throat.

635
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,250
LJ 
LJ 

636
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,840
-苏珊你敢 -爸爸 
Susan, don't you hurt Dad 

637
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,050
说真话
The truth.

638
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,150
真话
Truth.

639
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,340
迈克他们3:13会出来
Michael's getting out at 3:13.

640
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,550
我们3:45在碰头地点会合
We're meeting at the exchange point at 3:45.

641
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,840
苏珊求你了 我们这么做
Susan, please, we did this

642
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,250
只是为了确保安全
because we wanted to make sure the site was safe.

643
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,450
仅此而已 这就是唯一的原因
That's it, that's the only reason why we did it.

644
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,640
似乎你们在耍诡计啊
Sounds to me like you're planning another end round.

645
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,850
再一次营救计划
Another rescue.

646
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,850
不 不
No, no.

647
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,950
不是的 我们没有
We're not, we're not planning,

648
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,750
没耍诡计
re not planning another end round.

649
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,150
不 求你 只是 
No. Please, just 

650
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,150
放我儿子一马
let my son go.

651
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,150
放了他
Leave my son.

652
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,450
活的不错?
Living the good life, huh?

653
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,250
不是吧
Is that what this is?

654
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,340
过的太滋润了
Having too good a time here

655
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,950
都不想离开了?
to contemplate leaving?

656
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,150
我需要点时间想想
I needed some time to think.

657
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,740
我也需要点时间
Well, I needed some time

658
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,840
来和巴拿马人敲定协议
to finalize our agreement with the Panamanians,

659
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,740
但我被人拉来了这里
but instead I get dragged down here.

660
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,840
是 我知道 好不容易
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard

661
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,350
才说服你到这来
to convince you to come down here.

662
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,850
实话实说
I'm gonna be honest.

663
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,240
我是希望看到你这个样子
I was looking forward to seeing you

664
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:19,150
不过现在来了 我倒不这么想了
down here like this, but now i that i am here, i wouldn't wish this on anymore.

665
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,340
这些事能否稍后再谈
Can we just save all this till after 

666
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,240
我不知道
I don't know if we can or not.

667
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,950
想好了么 阿历克斯?
Made up your mind yet, Alex?

668
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,850
8年 最低监禁安全级别
Eight years, minimum security.

669
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,350
我让他们减到4年
I got'em down to four.

670
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,840
今晚就去美国?
And I leave for the US tonight?

671
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,440
一旦
Once the special

672
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,840
特别检查官确认你的事
prosecutor clears you,

673
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,440
你就可以上路了
you'll be on your way.

674
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,540
特别检察官是干嘛的
What about a special prosecutor?

675
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,940
就是你站在人们面前
You stand in front of a guy,

676
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,940
告诉检察官你的经历 由他决定
you, you tell your story and he determines

677
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,040
当然如果你决定做证人
if you're gonna be a useful and credible witness.

678
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,150
那些就只是些形式了
It's a formality.

679
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,850
只是些形式?
"It's a formality"?

680
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,850
就只是形式?
This is just a formality?

681
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,750
小子 如果换作是我
You know, if it were up to me,

682
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,850
你下半辈子就等着把牢底坐穿吧
you could rot in here for the rest of your life.

683
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,240
但是司法部
But the Justice Department

684
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,750
下了很大的决心
is extremely motivated to get to the bottom

685
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,850
把罗纳德总统的案子一查到底
of this President Reynolds business.

686
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,950
阿历克斯这绝对是个好出路
Alex, this is a hundred percent above board.

687
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,950
你的职业生涯犯错太多
You've made a lot of mistakes in your career.

688
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,340
你清楚 我也清楚
You know it and I know it,

689
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,840
不管是不是故意的
intentional or otherwise.

690
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,350
我桌上已经摞了8个对你的举报
I've got eight files in my office attesting to that.

691
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,850
如果你不接受这些条件
And if you don't take this offer,

692
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,840
我敢肯定
then I assure you it would be

693
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,350
你一定会后悔的
the biggest mistake of your life.

694
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,640
我知道是谁杀的
I know who killed that man.

695
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,550
你当然知道了
I'm sure you do.

696
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,350
勒齐
Lechero 

697
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,150
我们找到了什么
What do we have here?

698
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,250
我找到这个
I found this

699
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,550
在阿历克斯山德罗 马宏的号子里
in Alexander Mahone's cell.

700
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,750
你可想得真周到
Convenient 

701
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,150
把责任都推到一个明显不再能回答问题的人身上
To blame this on a man who can't even be questioned.

702
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,450
够了 乔 
Enough of this already. Cheo 

703
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,450
把人都叫来
Get the prison up.

704
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,150
现在
this time

705
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,040
你知道不是惠斯勒干的
You kno Whistler didn't do this.

706
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,150
他说了他在马宏号子里找到匕首了啊
He just said he found the shank in Mahone's cell?

707
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,240
还不能证明我是清白的?
Doesn't that prove I'm innocent?

708
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,050
你就会扯蛋 
You're a joke 

709
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,940
你口口声声公平
You talk about equality.

710
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,440
公正 但归根结底
You talk justice, but at the end of the day

711
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,640
你不过就是一个独裁者 跟别的独裁者一样
you're a dictator, and just like any dictator

712
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,340
你害怕失去权力
you're terrified of losing your power.

713
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,440
别再考验我的耐心了 小子
It'd be very unwise to go any further.

714
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,840
你并不关心真正的杀人犯是谁
You don't care who the real killer is

715
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,640
随便抓个人就行了
just as long as you get to string somebody up.

716
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,340
这对你来说就完事了 对不对
That's all that matters to you, isn't it?

717
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,240
谁有罪 我说了算 而有罪的 都要死 
I've determined who's guilty, and the punishment is death.

718
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,840
你错了 这是谋杀 
You're making a mistake. This is murder 

719
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,250
你清楚 我也清楚
You know it and I know it 

720
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,840
至少你得有胆量承认
At least have the guts to admit it 

721
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,650
没错 
You're right 

722
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:55,550
是谋杀
It's murder.

723
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,250
不要 
Don't 

724
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,650
我在院子里发现这个
I found this in the yard

725
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,650
这是原来奥古斯特上供给我的
Augusto used to give them to me as tribute.

726
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,750
现在你玷污了它
And now you reek of them.

727
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,450
滚吧
Go.

728
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,950
有什么事吗
Everything okay?

729
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,850
很惨吧 
It's sad 

730
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,950
走错一步 就得让个陌生人
one wrong move and a stranger

731
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,950
来给你下葬了
is throwing dirt on top of you.

732
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,450
他会没事的
He will be okay.

733
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,350
你怀疑你是不是真的爱自己的儿子
I question your love for your son.

734
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,650
他差一点就被我砍头了
He was two seconds away from being decapitated

735
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,150
就因为你
because of you.

736
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,450
我跟你说的都是实话
I told you the truth.

737
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,850
也许吧
Maybe.

738
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,640
如果你还有什么小想法
But if you have anything else planned,

739
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,750
趁早放弃
now it's scrapped.

740
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,250
因为 你知道那意味着什么
Because, what happens if you try something?

741
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,550
我知道
I know.

742
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,450
知道就好
Oh, good.

743
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,540
这报纸与上张照片里的是一样的
This is the same newspaper she was holding in the last picture.

744
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,040
我的人只能拿到这个
That's what my guy could get.

745
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,240
你给我的时间太有限了
You didn't give me a lot of time.

746
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,150
你以为迈克察觉不出?
You think Michael's not going to notice this?

747
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,250
那还能怎么样"迈克就就是照片"
Yeah."Hey, Michael, here's the pictures."

748
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,050
他会仔细看照片的
He's going to want to see this close up.

749
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,950
我已经帮你帮到头了
I'm done doing favors for you.

750
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,950
滚出去
Get out.

751
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,250
一小时后见
I'll see you in an hour.

752
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,050
今天没足球赛?
No football today?

753
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,050
没有
No, no football today.

754
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,650
我们是好兄弟吧 萨米?
You're my brother, Sammy?

755
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,050
那当然
Of course.

756
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,150
好了?
It's done?

757
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,250
警卫半小时内就会睡着
The guard will be asleep in a half hour.

758
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,250
太好了
So we're good.

759
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,950
还有点问题
Not quite.

760
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,950
他们 呃 知道了我们下午要越狱
They, uh, they know we're breaking out this afternoon.

761
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,350
你告诉她了?
You told her?

762
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,940
她猜到了 
Man, she worked it out 

763
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,850
-你撒个谎不就得了? -她猜出来了
Why didn't you lie? She worked out.

764
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,150
那我们现在怎么才能占到上风呢 林肯?
So what are we gonna do to get the upper hand here, Linc?

765
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,240
-没事 -你以为他们会给我们
Nothing. You think they're just going to turn over

766
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,140
-LJ和莎拉? -太冒险了
LJ and Sara? This is too dangerous.

767
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,440
如果我们试图救他们 他们就会 
If we try anything, they're just going to 

768
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,550
就会怎么样? 伤害他们?
What, hurt them?
