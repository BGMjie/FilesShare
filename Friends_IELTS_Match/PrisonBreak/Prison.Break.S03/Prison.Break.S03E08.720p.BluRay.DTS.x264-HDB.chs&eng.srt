你
You.

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,570
这是你的房间吧?
Is it your cell?

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,770
你准备越狱 斯科菲尔德先生
You are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,160
你得带上我
And you're taking me with you.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,440
那么
So with this deal

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,900
他们到底想从我这得到些什么?
what specifically are they expecting from me?

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,410
他们想知道所有的事
They need to know everything.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,470
他们要确认你的消息可靠
They want to confirm that you have viable,

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,580
并且能够帮助他们定罪
incriminating information

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,890
还要你乖乖地做个证人
and that you can be a cooperative witness.

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,150
给我看看照片
Show me the pictures.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,740
没照片看 兄弟
I can't show you the pictures, man.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,060
她死了 迈克
She's dead, Michael.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
不是说好了 你最好别来这吗
I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,190
我得知道这次耽搁会有多大影响
I need to know how this delay is going to affect things.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,740
再给我四天
four more days

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,510
要是我能离开这的话
If I'm out of here by then

我仍然能够做到
I can still do it.

我会转告那两兄弟的

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,680
我看起来怎么样
You like this?

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,690
不错
Yeah.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,690
今天是个特殊的日子
It's a special occasion.

25
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,000
我爸爸今天要来看我
My dad's coming today,

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,310
我在等他过来

You look sharp.

谢谢
Thanks.

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,620
斯科菲尔德 有访客
Scofield , you have a vistor

听着 在交易地点
Listen, back at the exchange point,

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,080
我看到了3个尸体袋
I saw three body bags.

35
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:57,980
你 我 还有LJ的
You, me and LJ,

36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,890
他们没想放过我们
we weren't getting out of there alive.

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,810
我不会再鲁莽行事了
That's the last time I get caught flatfooted.

38
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,080
那就去做你该做的事 林肯
Then do what you got to do, Linc.

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,680
我会管好我这里的事 行吗?
As long as I take care of my end, right?

40
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,700
迈克我知道莎拉的事 你很生我的气 但 
Michael, I know you're angry with me about Sara, but 

41
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,880
你说谎了
You lied.

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,110
我不得不说谎
I had to lie.

43
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,130
你儿子是我侄子
Your son is my nephew,

44
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,250
我会为他做一切的
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

45
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,650
但显然 
But apparently 

46
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,240
你认为我只在意自己的事
apparently you only think I only care about myself.

47
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,540
我知道你关心的不是自己
I know you don't care about yourself,

48
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,800
你关心的是莎拉
but you cared about Sara.

49
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,000
你爱她
You loved her.

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,460
我很遗憾
And I'm sorry.

51
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,040
但LJ是我儿子
But LJ's my son.

52
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,960
我 我不能让他有事
I-I couldn't let anything happen to him.

53
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,100
你知道的
You know that.

54
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,270
你利用了我 林肯
You used me, Linc.

55
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,570
你这点和组织倒是挺像的
So I guess you and the Company have something in common.

56
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,450
我不知道他在哪
I don't know where he is.

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,720
我所有号码都试了一遍
I have tried every number I have.

58
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,560
听着 我会再去总部查查
Listen I will check back in headquarters

59
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,930
看他们怎么说
and see what they say.

60
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,040
别管了
Never mind.

61
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,710
我找到他了
I found him.

62
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,400
蓝色卡特
Carter Blue Label.

63
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,550
你虽然出身平凡
You always had such

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,850
却很有品味嘛
high-end taste for a girl from Wheeling.

65
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,620
还不是用我的钱 
Since I paid for it 

66
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,560
你知道我有多么痛恨四处奔波 格雷琴
You know how much I hate to travel, Gretchen 

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,440
但是考虑到这里的状况 我不得不破例来一趟
 but considering the mess down here, I made an exception.

68
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,500
在我来之前 这里就混乱不堪
It was a mess before I got here.

69
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,220
那现在是时候清理下了
And it's time to clean it up.

70
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,190
今天就做个了结吧
We're ending this today.

71
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,320
来硬的
Bang and burn.

72
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,200
将军 我已经分析过了
General, that was analyzed.

73
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,010
如此做法
What you're asking for

74
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,870
太危险了 更何况
is too dangerous, not to mention

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,410
时间上根本来不及
next to impossible with the given time frame.

76
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,960
我认为
I remember

77
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,550
当一大笔钱汇到你海外帐户的时候
a substantial wire transfer to an offshore account

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,770
那就意味着我们的字典里没有"不可能"
that took the word"impossible"

79
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,700
难道说
out of the equation or tell me,

80
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,340
是我选错了人?
did I hire the wrong person?

81
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,900
提醒你做事要三思 也是我的工作
I am doing my job when I tell you to seriously reconsider.

82
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,800
那现在 我要按我的意思办了
And now, I have to do my job.

83
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,720
我不是花钱让你做我顾问的
I don't pay you to be my advisor.

84
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,420
你只是执行任务的
You're my operator.

85
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,210
你收到命令 就得完成任务
You have your instructions, now get it done.

86
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,200
不然的话
Beuse if you don't,

87
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,350
你上次在摩苏尔(伊拉克北部城市)
I'll make what happened to you in Mosul

88
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,710
遭受的一切就只是个开头罢了
feel like a massage.

89
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,110
这件事是个错误 格雷琴
This was a big mistake, Gretchen.

90
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,840
你不能老来这里
You can't make a habit of coming to Sona.

91
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,310
我不会了
I won't.

92
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,860
因为我们要来硬的了
Because we're going with the bang and burn .

93
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,690
那等于自寻死路
That's suicide.

94
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,030
我们还有时间呢
We have more time.

95
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,270
我老板想快点完事
My boss wants things to move a bit faster.

96
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,130
那你告诉他这样行不通
Well, tell him you can't pull it off.

97
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,710
这么干我可能会被杀了的
I might get killed if we do this.

98
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,930
不这么干我就会被干掉了
And I might get killed if we don't.

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,120
你和我之间
Between you and me,

100
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,250
你认为我会更关心谁?
who do you think I care about more?

101
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,260
看着我 詹姆斯
Look at me, James.

102
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,850
看看我有多认真
See if you can tell how serious I am.

103
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,780
如果你不配合
If you don't play ball,

104
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,360
你就等着把牢坐穿吧
I will leave you in Sona to rot.

105
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,190
我保证
I promise.

106
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,550
5点钟 准备好
Be ready by 5:00.

107
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,060
那时行动
That's when it happens.

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,980
一起行动
Everybody goes.

109
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,150
斯科菲尔德如何处置?
What about Scofield?

110
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,400
杀了他
Kill him.

111
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,220
如果有人看到我们俩说话 你知道后果的
You know the consequences if I'm seen talking to you?

112
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,340
军队正在加固所有门窗上的铁栏
The military's reinforcing the bars on all the windows.

113
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,820
能否和长官谈谈
Can you talk to the colonel,

114
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,820
让他暂缓几天?
get him to postpone that for a few days? .

115
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,260
经你昨天这么一闹
After your performance yesterday,

116
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,250
我已经没有发言权了
I have no further sway with the colonel.

117
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,560
那我恐怕你是选了条
Well, then I'm afraid you've brokered your way

118
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,050
根本不可能成功的路来逃生
into an escape plan that no longer exists.

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,540
我有办法了
I have an idea.

120
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,950
勒齐
Lechero 

121
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,340
等我消息
Wait to hear from me.

122
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,310
怎么了
What?

123
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,080
有些人不想再付保护费给你了
Some of the men don't feel the need to pay their debts anymore.

124
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,950
已经一周了
It's been one week, man,

125
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,490
我们已经少了三个人了
and we lost three men.

126
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,440
现在 如果我们要控制索纳监狱 我们需要人手
Now, if we gonna keep Sona, we're gonna need numbers.

127
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,550
这里我现在谁都不信 尤其是现在
I don't trust nobody here right now especially now.

128
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,310
我只想用自己人
I work with the men I have.

129
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,320
是吗 兄弟?
Really, brother?

130

还有那个废物 就靠我们三个?
and the gimp over there, we gonna run this place?

132
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,130
我想带上克里斯托巴
I want to bring on Cristobal.

133
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,900
他靠得住 老大
He's solid, man.

134
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,800
又是戴伦犹太人
One of them Darrien ghetto boys.

135
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,970
那就带上他吧
Bring him up.

136
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,370

一支美洲豹 一支步行者
A Cougar, a Stryker.

140
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,200
那不可能
Not gonna happen.

141
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,000
我请示过约克中士 但是 
I do have a call in to a Sergeant York, but 

142
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,440
计划不会改变
Yeah, that's not going to cut it.

143
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,790
打给苏扎梅尔 让他待命
Call Suezamel, put him on standby,

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,150
有需要会找他
tell him we might need him.

145
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,300
有问题吗?
Is there a problem?

我们5点就行动?

我们是可以等到晚上
well we could wait until tonight

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,950
除非我们的行动够快
when our guys are moving too fast

149
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,070
眼睛够好使
for our night vision to work properly.

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,940
干不干随你
You could even tag along if you want.

159
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,050
他房里有根管子坏了
There's been a busted pipe in his unit that's caused

160
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,490
导致邻居家受到损害
some damage to the apartment next door.

161
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:57,810
不好意思
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,300
我想你把詹姆斯和其他人弄混了
I think you have confused James with someoneelse.

163
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,870
他没租什么公寓
He's not renting another apartment.

164
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,080
我确定是惠斯勒先生租了我的房子
Oh, I assure you Mr. Whistler is my tenant.

165
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,940
自从他服刑后我就找不到人了
I couldn't find anyone to contact after his conviction,

166
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,360
但是我看到了他的一封话费账单
but when the mail came, I checked his phone bill.

167
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,270
他给这个号码打了很多电话
There were numerous calls to this number.

168
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,870
如果你能过来的话
If you could please come to the apartment,

169
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,120
地址是奥瓦里奥阿贝尔布拉沃40号
the address is 40 AbelBravo in Obarrio,

170
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,500
4单元
Unit 4.

171
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,050
告诉他们英特尔公司说
Tell your men the intel says

172
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,320
巴拿马人无法进入串行存取存储器
the Panamanians have no access to SAM.

173
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,180
喂
Yeah.

174
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,000
有进展了
There's been a development.

175
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,680
又给了我们四天时间
The Company's giving us four more days.

176
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,380
-好的 -问题是
-Okay. -Problem is

177
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,790
我 不知道我们怎么出去
I, uh, I don't know how we're getting out of here.

178
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,640
勒齐或许有办法 我还在等
Lechero might have some ideas, but I'm still waiting

179
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,870
他的消息
to hear from him.

180
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,630
对不起 你现在不方便吗
I'm sorry, is this a bad time for you?

181
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,230
这一天很难熬
It's been an intense 24 hours.

182
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,760
我脑子里很乱
I have things on my mind.

183
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,460
也许和你上一次的探视有关
Yeah, like your last trip to visitation maybe.

184
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,770
怎么 你监视我?
What, you're a spy now?

185
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,650
如果说错了别怪我 不过她看起来
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but she didn't really strike me

186
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,290
不像我喜欢的类型啊
as the girlfriend type.

187
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,890
她是组织派来的
She was Company.

188
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,680
你越狱失败后 她来提醒我
After your failed escape, she came to remind me

189
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,180
我也是在冒险
that I have a stake in this, too,

190
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,470
你似乎忘了这一点
which you seem to have forgotten.

191
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,760
如果你说在筹备另一个越狱计划
So forgive me if I don't jump for joy

192
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,560
别怪我没有兴高采烈
when you say you're working on a plan

193
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,570
因为那个计划可能又会失败
that may very well fail again.

194
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,560
我必须得出去
I've got to get out of here,

195
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,970
无论用什么方法
and it's getting to the point where I don't care how.

196
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,070
明白我的意思了吗
Got what we talked about?

197
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,270
你从没见过我
You never met me.

198
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,270
天哪
Oh, my God.

199
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,970
发生什么事了?
What the hell is going on?

200
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,960
谢尔斯 
Shales 

201
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,660
奥斯卡・谢尔斯怎么了?
What about Oscar Shales?

202
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,270
他 强奸 杀人 虐待
He raped, killed, tortured.

203
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,160
但我没办法治他罪
I couldn't turn, turn him over

204
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,260
那些混账律师要把他弄出去
to some scumbag lawyer who was just gonna get him off or 

205
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,970
不 我只是 
or no, no, I just 

206
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,170
所以我杀了他
so I killed him.

207
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,570
我感觉 很好
And I felt good.

208
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,170
非常非常好
I felt, I felt really good.

209
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,560
然后你知道吗 我脑海里就一直出现
But then, you know, came the visions

210
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,560
谢尔斯求我放他生路的一幕
of Shales begging for his life,

211
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,170
我摆脱不了
and I couldn't get rid of them,

212
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,670
所以我得靠吃药来保持平静
so I, I got these drugs that kept me on an even keel.

213
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,760
当我到了索纳监狱
And then when I got to Sona,

214
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,670
我拿不到药 所以我不得不 
I coul get my pills, so I had to 

215
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,470
临时救急
improvise.

216
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,170
要我帮你弄点药吗
Did you want me to get drugs for you?

217
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,960
我确信想让我作证的人
I assume that whoever set this up must think

218
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,970
一定是觉得我还有价值
that I might have some value.

219
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,270
这是你回来找我的原因吧
It's why you came back for me.

220
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,570
我是来帮助一个我敬仰和关心的人
I came here to help a man that I respect and care about.

221
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,570
荣幸之至
And I appreciate that.

222
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,870
但是我现在这个样子没法作证
But I can't testify like this.

223
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,870
求你了 
Please 

224
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,770
求你了 
Please 

225
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,170
窗户上都加了一英尺厚的强化钢
One inch of reinforced steel on every window.

226
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,070
没人出的去
Nothing would get through those.

227
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,970
我会找到办法的
I'll figure something out.

228
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,870
我知道你会
I know you will.

229
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,270
听着 刚才很抱歉
Listen, man, I'm sorry about before.

230
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,760
就像我说的 事情变得很紧张了
Like I said, things have been intense.

231
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,970
行动成功太重要了
So much depends on this working out.

232
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,460
我侄子的命也取决于这次的行动
My nephew's life depends on this working.

233
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,970
我知道
I know it does.

234
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,670
我还没问过 他多大了?
I never asked how old is he?

235
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,370
16岁
Sixteen.

236
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,070
天哪
Oh, hell.

237
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,370
叮咚 叮咚
Knock knocka.

238
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,760
你来干嘛?
What do you want?

239
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,360
我? 我只是来把一些东西
Me? I just came by to slip something

240
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,460
扔进你的信箱里
into your mail slot.

241
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,360
是老大给的
It's from El Patron himself,

242
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,470
但是只给你们看
but it was made for your eyes only.

243
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,670
收好了
Grabby.

244
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,560
我看这可不像是一个舞会
That don't look like no invitation

245
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,460
邀请函什么的
to the Sona-Hains Dance.

246
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,860
你和勒齐在策划什么事?
What do you got cooking up with Lechero, huh?

247
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,870
不关你的事 蒂博格
It's none of your business, Theodore.

248
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,260
你想对我保密?
You want to keep secrets?

249
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,560
你当我是一支讨厌虫? 随便你
You want to treat me like a pesky insect? Fine.

250
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,360
给我记住 情报 就像面包屑
Just remember, information, like crumbs,

251
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,870
总会撒落在地上让虫子吃掉的
always trickles down to the vermin on the floor.

252
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,470
4点钟?
4:00?

253
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,970
这是勒齐牢房的草图
It's a sketch of Lechero's quarters.

254
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,360
老实说 如果有房客提前支付一年的房租
To be honest, when a tenant pays a year's rent in advance

255
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,970
也不来住的话
and then gets locked up,

256
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,360
我一般都会把这房子再租出去
I normally rent the place out

257
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,960
赚双倍的钱 不过
and double my money, but, uh,

258
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,570
詹姆斯人不错
James was a good man.

259
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,270
我一直希望他的事情可以有转机
I was hoping things would turn out well for him.

260
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,470
我说 夫人
Look, uh, miss 

261
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,360
很多人都会有一些自己的秘密
a lot of guys have a little something on the side.

262
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,060
我是说 这个公寓 无论他带谁来过这里
This apartment, I mean, whoever he brought here,

263
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,870
并不意味着他不爱你
doesn't mean he didn't love ya.

264
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,770
你说你这有詹姆斯的保险单?
You said you have James' insurance paper?

265
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,160
稍等 马上
Right on. Right on.

266
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,070
我去给你拿来
I'll, uh, I'll go get them.

267
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,470
哦 我的天
Oh, God.

268
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,370
那儿还有一扇门
There's another door in here.

269
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,770
"4413"
"4413."

270
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,670
4413 对吧
4413, huh?

271
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,260
那斯科菲尔德怎么办
What about Scofield?

272
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,670
干掉他
Kill him.

273
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,270
如果这个草图不是勒齐给我们的
You know, if Lechero didn't send this,

274
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,970
那么这事就是有人派蒂博格算计我的
T-Bag might be setting me up for someone.

275
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,060
我们从这里出去
I say we get out of here.

276
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,170
迈克 你因为我惹上了这么多麻烦 很抱歉
I'm truly sorry you got caught up in my troubles, Michael.

277
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,300
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,800
这儿还有一个密码锁
I take it there's another code.

279
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,290
我是唯一知道的人
I'm the only one that knows it.

280
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,890
对于一个喜欢保密的人
For a man who likes keeping a secret,

281
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,290
选择蒂博格作为送信人
choosing T-Bag as a go-between

282
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,490
可不是一个明智的选择
might not be the smartest move.

283
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,290
是的 不过当他想明白的时候 我们早就跑远了
Yeah, by the time he figures it out, we'll be long gone.

284
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,400
萨米正在回来的路上 走吧
Sammy's on his way back. Let's go.

285
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
这是他妈什么?
What the hell's this?

286
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,400
地下通道
Underground tunnel.

287
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,890
原来看守用做
The old administration used it

288
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,100
从A区到B区的通道
to travel between cellblocks A and B.

289
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,000
自从暴动之后 他们把我们都转移到了B区
After the riots, they moved us all to B.

290
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
然后当兵的就
And then the soldiers came in,

291
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,500
把这个通道炸了
blew this tunnel up.

292
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,000
看起来有人已经试图打通这些废墟了
Looks like someone already tried to get through the debris.

293
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
我可没打算一辈子都待在这里
I never planned to spend my whole life in Sona.

294
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,100
只是没想到这么快就得走了
Just didn't expect it to end so soon.

295
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,400
你是工程师 对吧
You're the engineer, though, right?

296
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,600
我想你能弄条路出去吧?
You can dig our way out of this?

297
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
是的 但我需要几个装载机
Yeah, me and a couple of payloaders.

298
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,790
给我听好了
Now, you listen.

299
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,100
你必须得从这里挖出去
You're gonna dig out of this place.

300
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,500
我们不能挖出去 不过我们可以试试向上挖
We're not digging out, but we might be diggin up.

301
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,500
你好 索菲亚
Hello, Sofia.

302
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,400
你好 你是谁
Hello. Who are you?

303
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,900
詹姆斯的一个朋友
Friend of James.

304
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,900
老朋友
Old friend.

305
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
他现在不在
Well, he isn't here.

306
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,800
我知道他在哪
I know where he is.

307
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,000
我可知道詹姆斯为什么喜欢你了
I can see why James loves you.

308
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
你真漂亮
You are beautiful.

309
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,090
如果你继续到处瞎打探消息
If you keep sticking your nose where

310
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,490
而不乖乖待着的话
it doesn't belong,

311
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,490
我会让他再也见不到你的
I'm gonna make him miss you very, very much.

312
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,600
你知道我的意思了吧
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

313
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,100
很好
Good.

314
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,300
这个不需要你来操心
You don't need to worry about this.

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,700
听清楚了索菲亚 这样你才不会受到伤害
Now listen very carefully to me, Sofia, and you won't get hurt.

316
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,090
我要你回家待着 做做头发
I want you to go home and do your hair

317
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,790
涂好指甲 准备好
and paint your nails and get all ready

318
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,400
等着詹姆斯回家
for when James comes home.

319
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,190
然后你们就幸福地过一辈子
You two will live happily ever after.

320
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,700
你想从他这儿得到什么
What do you want from him?

321
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,100
瞧 你又不听话了
See? You're not listening already.

322
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,690
别插手这事
Don't get in the way,

323
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,100
不然你会很难堪的
or I promise you things will get very bad for you.

324
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,200
你真的很漂亮
You are truly beautiful.

325
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,900
我希望你可以始终这样
I hope you can stay that way.

326
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,100
现在滚吧
Get the hell out of here

327
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,490
好吧 如果我们可以穿过天花板
All right, if we can get through

328
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,590
地基 还有上面的土层
the ceiling, the foundation and the earth on top othat,

329
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,900
我们就可以上到禁入区了
we can make it out into the middle of no-man's-land

330
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,100
然后我们可以在被击中之前到达围栏
and maybe hit the fence before we get shot.

331
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,700
是啊 我们可不想被射死
Yeah. Well, we wouldn't want that.

332
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,700
对的 不过你确实可以挖通 对吧
Yes, but you can dig out, though, right?

333
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,390
根据重力学和索纳地下的沙质情况来看
Based on gravity and the kind of sand that Sona's built on,

334
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,590
我们在挖掘时需要支柱来支撑这个通道
we're gonna need some kind of support brace for the tunnel.

335
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
不然的话
Or 

336
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,500
不然怎样?
Or what?

337
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,800
不然整个隧道会坍塌 我们就会被活埋
The whole thing collapses and we're buried alive.

338
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,500
大家随便点
Go on and relax, huh?

339
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,000
我去弄点朗姆酒来
I'll get some rum.

340
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,490
这要花多久时间
How long will this take?

341
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
大约两天
Maybe two days.

342
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,190
我得上楼去看看 估算我们
I got to get upstairs, estimate exactly where

343
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,600
从隧道出去后到底处于禁入区的什么方位
in no-man's land that tunnel's gonna let out.

344
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,190
你去哪 我正考虑问题呢
Where you going? I'm meditating.

345
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,390
来给克里斯托巴和他的人弄点朗姆酒
Just getng rum for Cristobal and his boys.

346
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,600
朗姆酒? 给他的人
Rum? His boys? 

347
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,490
我确实说过愿意见见克里斯托巴
No, I said I'd meet with Cristobal,

348
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,090
但不是一大堆人
not every half-breed in Sona.

349
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,490
不过 他们现在正在上面呢
Well, they up there right now.

350
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,890
那我们走
So, let's go.

351
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,090
-让我给他们弄点朗姆酒吧 -没门
-Let me just get some rum, now. -No, man.

352
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,390
让他们向其他人一样喝啤酒好了
Then drink beer like everyone else.

353
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,190
我说 哥们 给他们点好东西
Look, man, offer them something good.

354
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,000
不要让我难堪
Don't make me look fool.

355
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
这酒是我的 萨米
The rum is for me, Sammy.

356
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,000
我说不行
No?

357
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,700
你有意见吗
You have a problem with that?

358
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,300
没意见 先生
No, sir.

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,890
很好
Good.

360
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,000
那我们走吧
Let's go.

361
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,200
我们继续干吧
Let's get back to work.

362
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,400
只有勒齐才知道密码
Hey, only Lechero has the code.

363
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,800
我们不需要密码
We don't need a code.

364
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,490
进去
Now, get inside.

365
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,300
在萨米回来之前
before Sammy comes back.

366
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
阿历克斯
Alex?

367
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,900
兰探员呢
Where's Agent Lang?

368
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,500
她 不知道
Agent I don't know.

369
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,300
你这是怎么了 发生什么了吗
But what the hell's wrong with you? What's going on?

370
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,590
我有权紧张
I have a right to be nervous.

371
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,290
我的处境很危险 不是吗
My life is on the line, you know?

372
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,600
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

373
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,390
你以前总是召开现场记者招待会
You have given live press conferences your entire life.

374
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,090
我见过很多次了 你是老手了
I've seen you many times. You're an old pro.

375
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,990
去洗个脸
Now, splash some water on your face.

376
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,890
陪审团让我们现在就去 马上
The panel wants us there right now, immediately.

377
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,000
-什么? -穿好衣服
-What? -Get dressed.

378
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:40,890
还是你想让我
Or would you rather have me

379
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,600
把你再送回索纳?
drag your ass back to Sona?

380
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,500
洗洗脸 穿上西装 我们现在就走
Water on the face. Get your suit on. We're going.

381
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,790
是 这是苏林斯
Yeah, it's Sullins.

382
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,190
我们马上就出发了
Uh, we're almost ready to move here.

383
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,600
兰到底去哪了
Where the hell is Lang?

384
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,100
不
No.

385
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,100
我们进展如何
Where are we at?

386
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,490
一切就绪
Everything's in place.

387
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,290
不错 我们准备好了
Good. We've done our part.

388
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,700
现在就等惠斯勒了
Now it's time for Whistler to step up and do his.

389
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,400
5点过来 他最好准备好了
Come 5:00, he better be ready.

390
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,290
打通三尺厚的钢筋混凝土
Three feet of concrete and rebar,

391
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,400
和10尺的泥沙
plus ten feet of dirt and sand,

392
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,900
我们就能看见外面了
before we see sky.

393
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,900
你怎么了
Are you all right?

394
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,800
老实说
To be completely honest 

395
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,300
不好
no,

396
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,300
一点儿都不
not really.

397
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,790
我不能呆在狭窄的空间里
I have this thing for, uh, confined spaces.

398
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,390
你有幽闭恐怖症?
Are you telling me you're claustrophobic?

399
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,590
从我还是个 
Ever since I was a 

400
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,390
孩子的时候
boy.

401
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,990
我必须上去
Um, you know, I need to be upstairs.

402
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,390
现在不行
That's not really an option right now.

403
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,390
我真的不能呆在这里
Well, staying here is not really an option for me, either.

404
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,890
振作一下
I suggest you get yourself togetr.

405
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,600
我去透透气
I just need some air.

406
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,790
你到底怎么了
What the hell's the matter with you?

407
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,790
-我得出去透透气 -如果你现在上去
-I need to get out of here; I need air. -Hey, you walk

408
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,990
萨米就在那里
through that door with Sammy on the other side,

409
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,990
你上去就死定了
you'll never need air again.

410
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,900
你不明白的 我得离开这里
You don't understand,I need to get out of here now.

411
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,990
告诉我究竟发生了什么惠斯勒
Why don't you tell me what's really going on here, Whistler?

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,690
你干嘛总看表
Why do you keep looking at your watch?

413
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,200
你到底要去哪
What are you really up to?

414
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
斯科菲尔德 他们走了 快走
Scofield, the men are gone, let's move.

415
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,390
我想用一下手机
I need your cell phone.

416
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,890
不行 萨米马上就回来了 离开这里
No, Sammy's on his way, get out of here.

417
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,090
-我得打电话给我哥 -不行 手机得放我这
-I have to call my brother. -No, cell phone stays with me. Now,

418
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
赶紧离开这儿
get out of here 

419
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,690
美国佬 我们得说说清楚
Well, just so that we're clear, Americano,

420
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,890
这房子没通电 没有自来水
she's got no electricity and no running water.

421
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,100
而且屋里没有卫生间 但是林子里可以方便
Septic's out, too, but there's an outhouse in the woods.

422
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,490
-不错 一个月100 -200

Deal.

425
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,800
但是不准种毒品
But I don't want growing no drugs on the land.

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,500
也不准种大麻
No marijuana.

427
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,000

You got that?

428
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
-欢迎回家 朋友 -谢了
-Welcome home, my friend. -Thanks.

429
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,290
哥们儿 如果你现在不想干了
Listen, man, if you want to get out of here,

430
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,900
我会理解的 迈克也会的
I'd get it and Michael would, too.

431
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,690
你已经做了很多了
You've done more than enough.

432
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
如果换作我儿子被绑架
If I had a kid in the same situation as your son,

433
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,900
你们兄弟俩会帮我吗
would you and your brother walk out on me?

434
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,400
当然会了
Yeah.

435
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,090
这里就行
Here, this is good.

436
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
把它放在这
Put it down there.

437
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
拿好
Okay, hold on.

438

445
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,400
事实上 我也需要他的帮助
Actually, uh, I need his help, too.

446
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,990
你想让他干什么
What you want from my old man?

447
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,990
我只是想找个信任的人
I just need someone to deliver

448
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,890
能在外面帮我传个消息
a message on the outside, someone I can trust.

449
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,190
不 我爸爸性格很直
Hell, no. My papa's straight as razor blade.

450
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,790
他不想惹事上身
He don't get into kind of trouble like you do.

451
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,100
-不会惹麻烦的 只是打个电话 -不
-It's not trouble, it's just a phone call. -No.

452
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,600
我爱我爸爸
I love my father.

453
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,650
我也爱我哥哥 如果他没有收到消息的话
And I love my brother, and if he doesn't get this message

454
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,400
就会发生可怕的事
something horrible's gonna happen to him.

455
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,190
听着非常不好的事情就会发生
Look something really bad is going on.

456
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200

答应我今天不要去找林肯・布鲁斯

-林肯? -真的很危险
-Lincoln? -It's just too dangerous

480
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,600
只要接近他 就会有危险

回家呆着

00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400

他指名道姓要找你

00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,900

我不知道什么另一个公寓

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,990
-把那房子锁起来 -不能让它有所改变
and secure the house. It can't have anything new on it.

520
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
那地方得弄成像是废弃的
The place needs to look abandoned.

521
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,590

小时候 我和迈克
When me and Mikey were kids,

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,990
有一套暗号 用来对付
we had a code when Social Services

530
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,900
那些想把我关进少管所的人
were trying to get me into juvie.

531
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,100
这是他让我小心的暗号
He's telling me to watch my back.

532
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,690
你在这干什么呢
What the hell are you doing here?

533
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,690
你怎么不回我电话 也不还我车?
Why haven't you returned my calls or my car?

你看见他了吗

00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,800
他刚回酒店

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,900
但是惠斯勒的女朋友也找到他了
But Whistler's girl tracked him down.

537
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,890
她正在跟
And she's talking

538
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
林肯和那个墨西哥人说话

539
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,900
她昨天看到了那些东西 一定会让事情复杂化
After what she saw today, she could be complicating things.

540
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,200

我说过了
I warned her.

把他们都干掉
Take them all out.

543
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,590
那惠斯勒会怎样?
What will Whistler say?

544
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,000
我说把他们都干掉
I said take them all out

545
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,990
我不关心你男朋友
I don't care about your boyfriend's apartment

546
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,490
在那里的公寓 不关我的事
on the side, I just don't care.

547
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,790

558
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,090

00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,600
詹姆斯让我今天离你远点
James told me to stay away from you today,

563
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,100
因为会很危险

564
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,800
我们上

565
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,100
你绝对猜不到 是迈克・斯科菲尔德的哥哥

谁给我打电话
Who calls me 

575
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,900
我打给谁
and who I call,

576
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,900
都是我的事
is my business.

577

582
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,900
你为什么纠缠不休?
Why are you coming after this?

583
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,000
一切又重演了是吗 林肯
Different day, same problem, huh, Lincoln?

584
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,090
那天LJ也这样在我手里 你知道后果的
You know how it turned out when LJ was in this position,

585
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,000
今天也是一样
and today is no different 

586
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,500
所以乖乖地放下枪
so be a good boy and put down the gun.

587
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,090
快点 林肯
Come on, Linc.

588
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,300
我知道你已经有过次教训了
I know you've learned your lesson.

589
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,400
你说得对 我是有了
You're right, I have.

590
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,490
我郑重声明
For the record,

591
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,490
这是美国政府要求举行的
this is an international hearing,

592
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,790
一次国际听证会
requested by the United States government,

593
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,100
目的是听取阿历克斯・马宏先生的证词
for the purpose of hearing testimony from one Mr. Alexander Mahone.

594
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,700
你不是开玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

595
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,400
马宏先生
So, Mr. Mahone,

596
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,090
你第一次接触
when were you first contacted by anyone

597
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,400
这个所谓的"组织"是什么时候
from the group referred to the Company?

598
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,400
他们告诉我
They told me 

599
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,490
如果我不把福克斯河越狱的8个人都杀掉
that if I didn't kill every one of the Fox River Eight,

600
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,100
他们就会来对付我
that they would come after me.

601
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,190
那些人都跟斯科菲尔德一起
They had all worked with-with Scofield

602
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,890
执行了越狱计划
on-on-on the escape,

603
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,590
所以"组织"不确定他们到底知道了什么
so the Company wasn't sure what they knew.

604
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,590
马宏先生 请你
Mr. Mahone, I'm going to ask you

605
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,700
不要答非所问
to please keep your answer related to the question.

606
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,890
这些其实都互有关联的
It's-it's all connected.

607
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,000
它是个 是张复杂的大网
It's just it's-it's a web.

608
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,600
我身陷在这个网里
And-and it's a web that I got caught in.

609
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,890
林肯・布鲁斯被卷入其中
And-and Lincoln Burrows got caught in,

610
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,090
迈克・斯科菲尔德也是
and Michael Scofield got caught in.

611
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,890
我如果可以
I, if I may,

612
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,490
我想马宏先生是想说 
I think what Mr. Mahone 

613
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,590
-我们都像苍蝇一样 -我是说 
-We're all just like flies -was trying to say 

614
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,790
谢谢你 苏林斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Sullins,

615
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,700
但我们要听的是马宏先生的证词
but we're here to hear from Mr. Mahone.

616
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,100
现在 我们再来一次
Now, we're going to try this again.

617
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,790
你什么时候第一次接触到
When were you first contacted

618
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,400
组织?
by the Company?

619
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,400
我不能说
I cannot say.

620
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,900
你知道 
You know 

621
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,090
他们什么时候联络你 或者
they could be in contact with you or-or-or 

622
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,890
什么时候你被联络 都是未知的
you could be in contact with them, you'd never know.

623
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,200
他们也许现在正在联络我们
It's-it's they could be in contact with us right now.

624
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,100
我知道 
I know 

625
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,190
这听起来太疯狂了 不是么?
it sounds crazy, right?

626
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,590
简直疯了
It's crazy and 

627
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,300
但这很有可能 而事实上 
and it would be, except for the simple fact that 

628
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,600
的确如此
It's true.

629
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,590
我为之卖命的政府
The government that I had dedicated my life to

630
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,000
操纵和威逼我
Manipulate and extorted me.

631
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,700
并勒索我
Blackmailed me.

632
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,700
所以我才为他们杀人
So that I would kill for them.

633
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
我所做的一切都是他们逼的
And I did the things that they made me do

634
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,100
因为我要保护我的家人
so I could protect my family.

635
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,200
所以 
And so 

636
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,000
我想回家
I would like to go home.

637
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,000
我能回家么?
So can I do that, please?

638
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,900
你去哪了?
Where have you been?

639
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,690
我去找了
I came looking

640
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,400
能支撑地道的废铁
for scrap metal for the support brace for the tunnel.

641
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,500
当真?
Really?

642
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,390
我看来上面挺挤的
Looks like a pretty tight squeeze up there.

643
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,790
你肯定那里有充足的氧气
You sure there's enough fresh air,

644
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,890
还是只有幽闭病人才会来这种地方?
or does the claustrophobia come and go?

645
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,990
为什么总是如此不信任别人呢?
What's it like going through life always distrustful?

646
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,190
你告诉我 詹姆斯
You tell me, James.

647
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,790
不想打断你们的争吵 先生们
Hate to break up the brouhaha, gentlemen,

648
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
但勒齐想见你
but Lechero would like to see you.

649
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,700
想和你聊聊你大哥的事
Says it has something to do with your big brother.

650
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,600
让我们单独待会好吗 蒂博格?
Give us a moment, will you, Teodoro?

651
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,600
如果你哥再给我打电话
If your brother should ever call my cell phone again,

652
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
告诉他你会因此付出代价的
you tell him you're the one that's gonna pay.

653
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,590
喂
Yeah?

654
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,190
-你收到消息了 -是的 你是对的
-You got the message. -Yeah, you were right.

655
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,800
他们刚想把我们干掉呢
They just tried to take us out.

656
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,700
我知道
I know.

657
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,490
组织的人曾来探视过惠斯勒
Whistler got a visit from the Company.

658
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,290
从那之后他行为就很反常
He's been acting strange ever since.

659
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,590
林肯 我告诉你 肯定出事了
I'm telling you, Linc, something's up.

660
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,990
兄弟 还有比行为反常更严重的
Doing more than acting strange, man.

661
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,090
他告诉索菲亚别接近我
He just told Sofia not to be

662
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,900
因为这很危险
near me 'cause it's dangerous.

663
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,900
组织盯上我们了
The Company's coming after us.

664
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,000
他们不再需要我们了
They don't need us anymore.

665
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,900
准备行动
Here we go.

666
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,600
他们要自己动手帮他越狱了
They're breaking him out on their own.

667
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,290
我们距离目标100码
We're 100 yards from the target.

668
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,600
保持警惕 行动要快
Keep your eyes open. Let's get in and out fast.

669
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,200
来吧
Come on 

670
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,400
糟了
Damn 

671
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,100
快点
Come on 

672
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,400
快点 加把劲
Come on Keep it coming 

673
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,700
快啊
Come on Hey 

674
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,990
我看到了一架直升机和两名狱徒
I've got a helicopter and two inmates.

675
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,500
我看不清他们的脸 但他们在屋顶
I can't make out their faces, but they're on the roof 

676
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,700
快啊
Come on 

677
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,600
看不清楚
Can't get a clean shot 

678
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,100
我降低高度 带他们走
I'll get lower, take 'em out 

679
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,600
是斯科菲尔德和惠斯勒在屋顶上吗
Is that Scofield on the roof with Whistler?

680
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,100
毫无疑问
Is that really a question?

681
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,390
他死定了
He's supposed to be dead.

682
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,900
有人中枪 有人中枪
Man down. Man down.

683
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,100
快走 我要掉下去了
Let go I'm slipping.

684
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,000
惠斯勒掉下去了 行动中止 行动中止
We lost Whistler. Abort. Abort.

685
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,190
任务失败
Mission failure.

686
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,000
马上返回一号基地
Return to Base One immediately.

687
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,500
阿历克斯 
Alex 

688
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,700
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

689
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,100
我不得不把你送回索纳监狱
I'm going to have to take you back to Sona.

690
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,300
你 起来
You, get up.

691
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,500
走 
Vamos 

692
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,500
斯科菲尔德先生
Mr. Scofield,

693
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,890
两天内发生了两起越狱未遂事件
there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.

694
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,690
我相信这不是偶然
Somehow I don't think it's a coincidence

695
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,700
都发生在你来后不久
that you arrived shortly before they happened.

696
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,400
我与此事无关
I had nothing to do with that.

697
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,100
你在索纳惹事太多
You've caused too many problems here in Sona,

698
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,400
或许你不该留在索纳
so maybe you shouldn't be here in Sona.

699
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,100
把他带走
Get him out.

700
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,600
和索纳说再见吧 斯科菲尔德先生
Say good-bye to Sona, Mr. Scofield.
