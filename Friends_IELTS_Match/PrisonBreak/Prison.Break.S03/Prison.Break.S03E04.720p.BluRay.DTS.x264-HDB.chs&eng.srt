1
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,140
-你找到我的书了吗? -找到了
-Were you able to find my book? -Yeah.

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,840
但有个家伙出现
But there was this guy.

3
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,150
把书抢走了
He took it.

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,840
他让我告诉你
He said to tell you

5
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,840
斯科菲尔德的哥哥拿了那本书
that Scofield's brother has it now.

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,140
你得把他们救出来
You have to break them out of there.

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,450
LJ 
LJ 

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,750
莎拉 
Sara 

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,140
别再尝试这么做
You're never going to try anything like that again.

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,040
只是为了确认
But just to make sure,

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,250
我在车库里给你留了点东西
I left you a little something in the garage.

12
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,650
窗外有什么比自由更吸引人的东西么?
What's so interesting out there, other than our freedom?

13
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,950
出逃者还活着 证明围墙上没电
Finds are alive, so the fence is dead

14
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,140
是么?这里每个人都知道那围墙没用
Yeah? Everyone in here knows is that fence doesn't work,

15
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,140
但这也改变不了什么
and it doesn't mean a bloody thing,

16
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,340
因为外面有士兵把守
because there are soldiers out there

17
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,240
只要你在30码内他们就会把你射死
that'll shoot you dead before you get within 30 yards of it.

18
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,750
我得好好计划一下了 不是么?
Well, I guess I got a lot of work to do, don't I?

19
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,940
听着 老兄 我知道你抢了我的书
Listen, mate, I get what you're doing with my book.

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,340
他们抓走了你的女友 而你抢走了他们要的东西
They hold your girlfriend, you hold what they want.

21
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,340
互惠互利 Churchill 101法案
Countering needs. Churchill 101.

22
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,540
马上那些杂种就要来问我
Soon those bastards are going to ask me

23
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,240
他们所要的 我了解了多少
what progress I've made in figuring out what they want,

24
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,550
我就要说完全不了解 因为林肯・布鲁斯把书抢走了
and I'm going to say nil, 'cause Lincoln Burrows has the book.

25
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,750
知道么?
You know what?

26
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,740
威胁
Threatening the brother

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,040
要帮你越狱的人的哥哥
of the guy who's supposed to get you out of here

28
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,240
并不是个好主意
might not be the smartest move.

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,350
我没有威胁你 我们在同一条船上
I'm not threatening we're on the same team.

30
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,640
但如果我们因为那本书纠缠不清
But if we play games with that book,

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,950
那些想让我出去的人会采取行动的
people who want me out of here will take action

32
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,950
"我不在乎你们做什么 就怕你们什么也不做"
"I never worry about action, only inaction."

33
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,840
根据Churchill 101法案
Churchill 101.

34
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,650
如我所说 现在我有很多事要做
Now, like I said, I got a lot of work to do.

35
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,650
林肯 你还好吧?
Linc, you all right?

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,540
对不起 老弟
I'm sorry, man.

37
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,340
都是那东西 它快找到我了
Just all this stuff it's starting to get to me.

38
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,350
知道么?
You know?

39
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,640
听着 我们的境遇很快会改变
Listen, our situation could change very, very soon.

40
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,450
那个监狱掘墓人
The grave digger for the prison.

41
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,440
你得和他联系上
I need you to reach out to him.

42
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,640
告诉他什么?
And tell him what?

43
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,840
都写在上面了
It's all written down.

44
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,450
我们现在就得采取行动
But we got to get started now.

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,950
你有什么没告诉我的?
What are you not telling me?

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,240
所有人
All these people

47
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,850
都因为我而受伤害
that have been hurt because of me.

48
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,940
我很抱歉 迈克
I'm so sorry, Michael.

49
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,050
这是他们造成的 不是你
They did this, not you.

50
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,150
好吗?
Okay?

51
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,950
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

52
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,250
找到那个掘墓人
Just get to the grave digger.

53
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,250
我感觉我们没多少时间了
I feel like we're running out of time.

54
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,050
莎拉
Sara.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,800
这场较量中我只是一个棋子 林肯
I am just a soldier in this war, Lincoln,

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
和你一样
just like you.

57
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,500
我并不想那么做的
I did not want to do that.

58
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,190
你能理解
Can you even comprehend the intimacy

59
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,900
我对那个女人下手时的感受吗?
of the mechanics of what I had to do to that woman?

60
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,100
那太恐怖了 
It's horrible 

61
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,700
现在 如果你和你弟弟停止耍花招
Now, if you and your brother are done playing games,

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
LJ会没事的
LJ will be fine.

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,390
我最不想做的事是把他一块块寄给你
If not, the last thing I want to do send millions pieces of him to you

64
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,290
但如果你逼我
But if you push me

65
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,900
即使没逼那么狠 我会这么做的
and not even that far, I will.

66
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,200
你叫我干什么我就干什么
I'll do anything you want.

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,700
别伤害我的儿子就好
Just don't hurt my son.

68
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,600
这些都取决于你
That's really up to you.

69
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,290
我知道这几天很难熬
I know the past few days have been hard,

70
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,600
我也一样
for me, as well.

71
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,900
如果你想聊聊
If you want to talk about it,

72
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,100
我理解这痛苦的感觉
I know what this pain feels like.

73
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,790
我只想把那个人搞出Sona
I just want to get your boy out of Sona

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
然后接回我儿子
and get my son back.

75
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,900
迈克有计划了
Michael's got a plan.

76
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
我需要细节
I need details.

77
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,990
我们得把某个
We need to bring someone

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,100
在监狱工作的人拉拢过来
who works at the prison onto the team.

79
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,900
谁?
Who?

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,600
掘墓人
The grave digger.

81
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,300
去做吧
Get it done.

82
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,800
林肯 我需要那本书
Lincoln, I'm going to need that book.

83
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,600
中情局把你给我的那本做了笔迹鉴定
The Company did handwriting analysis on the one you gave me,

84
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
你的字迹从高中以来就没变过
and yours hasn't changed since high school.

85
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,000
我们只是棋子 林肯
Just soldiers, Linc.

86
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
代表不同方 但本质是一样的
Different armies, but soldiers just the same.

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
打得好
Nice.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,500
我在学校里是最棒的
I was the best in my school.

89
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
女校?
All girls?

90
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,890
去你的
Kiss my ass,

91
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,900
老兄
bro.

92
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,500
20美元赌你没法再投进
20 bucks says you can't do that again.

93
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,000
-好的 -等一下
-Bet. -Wait.

94
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
根据风向调整
Adjust for wind.

95
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000
闭嘴
Shut up.

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
向外偏一点就好了
Just a bit outside.

97
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,900
老兄 你知道我现在没有钱
Hey, bro, you know I don't have that kind of verde lying around.

98
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,900
需要点时间
It's going to take a while.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
问题在于 我没有时间了
Well, the thing is, I don't have a while.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
-所以 除非 -别 别再拉拢我了
-So, unless -No, no more favors.

101
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,290
好吧
All right.

102
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,890
我能借你的十字架一用么?
Can I borrow that cross of yours?

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,500
-就拿那个做交换吧 -这是我爸给我的
-I'll take it in trade. -My dad gave me this.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,490
还有 那甚至不是金的
Besides, it's not even real gold.

105
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,600
这正是我需要它的原因
That's why I need it.

106
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,690
听着 我会还给你的 好吗?
Look, I'll give it back, okay?

107
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,000
只是借
It's just a loan.

108
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
给我吧
Come on.

109
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,000
这次 我想知道原因
This time, I want to know why.

110
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,700
又是灯
It's light again.

111
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,390
有人正在破坏暴动后
Someone's getting fat off of everythg I built

112
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
我所建立的一切
while I rot in here.

113
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,490
别郁闷了
Don't get upset,

114
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,700
拜托
patron

115
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,300
我只有几个小时
I only have a few more hours.

116
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,600
让我们好好享受下
Let's be nice.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,100
该死的
This motherless bitch.

118
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,400
阿历克斯?
Alex?

119
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,490
你刚到这?
You just get here?

120
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,400
是的
Yes.

121
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,890
听好了
Listen,

122
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,500
我一直在权衡 决定让你入伙
I've been thinking about and, uh, you're in.

123
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,490
我算入伙了
I'm in.

124
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,790
好吧
Okay.

125
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
-就这么简单? -是的
-Just like that? -Right.

126
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
我别无选择 不是吗?
I really don't have a choice, do I?

127
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,590
你怎么计划的?
What's the plan?

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,700
我正在想办法
I'm working on it.

129
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,390
与此同时 你也可以帮上我的忙
Meanwhile, I could use your help.

130
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
你需要什么?
What do you need?

131
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,800
黑色毡尖笔
A black felt-tipped pen.

132
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,490
-一支钢笔? -没错
-A pen? -Yeah.

133
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,590
-为什么? -有些文件
-Why? -Some documents

134
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,300
需要做些改动
that need altering.

135
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,990
稍后再给你解释 我现在就要那支笔
I'll explain it to you later, but right now, I need that pen.

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,890
-行吗? -好的
-Okay? -Yeah.

137
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,090
我还要对你说的是
And I'll tell you what else I need.

138
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,890
我要你跟我们步调一致
I need you to get your act together.

139
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,190
我需要你控制好自己
I need you to bring yourself

140
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,590
因为你那样很夺人眼球
under control, because you're attracting attention,

141
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,700
而那是我们不想看到的
and that we don't need.

142
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,200
我能控制好自己
I'm under control.

143
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,800
你当然可以
Of course you are.

144
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,700
这就是用电负荷过大的下场
This is what happens when a system is overloaded.

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
看到吗?
See? Look.

146
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,600
-该死 -断电了
-Son of a -Power is out.

147
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,790
搞定它
Fix it.

148
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
我只是个卡车司机
I'm a truck driver.

149
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
嘿 阿历克斯
Hey, Alex.

150
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,990
很高兴找到你 就是来看看
Hey, glad I found ya. Just wanted to see how

151
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
-你在这过得怎样 -非常好
-you're holding up in here. -Just dandy.

152
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,690
我也经历过段受煎熬的日子
Yeah, well, I've been having a tough time of it myself.

153
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,790
但我想我们的命不该这样
And I was figuring shouldn't be that way

154
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,690
我们可是唯一的正直人士
for us, seeing as how we're the only lawmen here

155
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,800
在这个阴曹地府里
in Taco Hell.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,990
嘿 等会儿 阿历克斯
Hey, whoa, hang on a second there, Alex.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,290
你和我 我们可是一队的
You and me we were a team

158
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,190
还记得我们在外面的时候吗?
on the outside, remember?

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,890
我是你的部下 现在依然对你忠心不二
I was your dog, and I still got a lot of bark left in me.

160
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,090
布拉德 我很忙 你到底想怎样?
I'm busy, Brad. What do you want?

161
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,490
你和斯科菲尔德在计划逃跑是吧?
You and Scofield you're up to something, right?

162
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
你可以告诉我 兄弟之间没有隔阂
You can tell me, one badge to another.

163
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
我能帮上忙
I can help.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
你有黑色毡尖笔吗?
Do you have a black felt-tipped pen?

165
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,990
我没有
Not on me.

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,500
那你帮不了我
Then you can't help me.

167
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
我都知道了
I know.

168
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,590
你知道什么了?
You know what?

169
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,390
我知道你在计划越狱
I know you're trying to escape from here

170
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
和那个叫斯科菲尔德的家伙
with that man, Scofield.

171
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,600
-宝贝 -求你不要欺瞒我
Sweetheart Please, don't lie to me.

172
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,800
林肯・布鲁斯把一切都告诉了我
Lincoln Burrows, he told me everything.

173
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,390
有些非常有权势的人希望我出来
There are some very powerful people that want me out of here.

174
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,990
-他们让那哥俩救我出去 -为何?
And they want those brothers to get me out. Why?

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,300
我也不确定
I'm not sure.

176
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,100
应该和我在西雅图看到的场景有关系
Has something to do with a charter I did in Seattle.

177
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,190
我只知道他们的最终目的
What I do know is their end game

178
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
和我们的一样 就是让我逃出这鬼地方
is exa the same as ours, and that's me out of this hellhole.

179
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,490
一旦成功了
And once that happens,

180
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,200
你和我就会消失 永远销声匿迹
you and I will disappear forever.

181
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,290
但是我不想让你趟这趟浑水
But I don't want to involve you in this mess.

182
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,090
我想帮你啊
I want to help.

183
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,990
那太危险了
That's way too dangerous.

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,390
詹姆斯我不是在请求你的批准
I'm not asking your permission, James.

185
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,700
我是在告诉你
I'm telling you.

186
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,490
我自己一人也能搞定
I can do this on my own,

187
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,890
或者你可以把你知道的告诉我
or you can tell me what you know

188
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,600
然后我们共同解决
and we can work it through together.

189
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,200
我对发生的事情也不明白
I don't understand everything that's going on,

190
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,390
但是那对兄弟 他们显然试图
but these brothers, they're obviously trying

191
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,990
从我身上打探出信息来
to find out what they can about me.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,890
我们看看能从他们身上了解多少
Let's see what we can discover about them.

193
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,790
弄清楚他们的计划 了解真实目的
Find out what their plan is, see what they're all about.

194
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,090
他们帮你越狱 你却不信他们?
They're trying to get you out, and you don't trust them?

195
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,000
我谁都不信任
I don't trust any of these guys.

196
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,500
你也不该相信
And yoshouldn't, either.

197
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,690
如果你坚持要跟此事
If you insist on getting into this,

198
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
向我保证你会加倍小心
promise me you'll be careful.

199
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,990
因为如果你出什么三长两短
Because God knows I will die

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,700
我也不会苟活的
if anything happens to you.

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,800
嘿
Hey.

202
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
迈克
Michael.

203
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,100
拿着
Here.

204
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,500
我说过我要的是黑色毡尖笔
I said I need a black felt-tipped pen.

205
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,700
那是黑色的
That's black.

206
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,000
这不是我需要的
It's not what I need.

207
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,500
继续去找
Keep looking.

208
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
他在耍你
He's playing you.

209
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,000
他在耍你
He's playing you.

210
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,100
不要相信他
Do not trust him.

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,900
你那美国佬兄弟
Your amigo, the American.

212
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,100
他是建筑工程师 是吗?
He's a builder, an engineer, no?

213
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,000
老大 他可不是我的朋友
He's no amigo of mine, boss.

214
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,790
相信我 你绝不希望
And trust me, you do not want

215
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,690
和他扯上关系 
to get under the covers with that 

216
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,500
回答我 是或不是工程师?
Is he or is he not an engineer?

217
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
好吧 是的 但是 
Well, yeah, but 

218
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,900
斯科菲尔德
Scofield.

219
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,000
什么事?
Yeah?

220
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,890
你懂电路吗?
What do you know about the electricity?

221
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,800
停电时候就会懂吧
Only that we don't have any right now.

222
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,700
和你说件事情
Let me tell you something.

223
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,090
这部手机能让食物运进来
This phone keeps all the food coming to the gate.

224
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,190
这样才能保障Sona监狱的正常运转
It keeps my business running, it keeps Sona running.

225
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,290
断电了 电话也就不能用了
Electricity die, phone die.

226
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
-电话没了我们也完蛋 -我们完蛋 你也完蛋
Phone die, we die. We die or youdie?

227
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,090
小子 你知识够丰富
Boy, you have enough

228
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,890
但是人不够聪明
education, but you're not being smart.

229
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,790
我来找你 是给你机会
Now, I come to you, that is an opportunity.

230
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,590
放聪明些 好好把握机会
Be wise and take advantage.

231
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,200
现在回答我 能修复电路吗
Now, can you fix the electricity

232
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,690
就像你搞定水源那样
just like you fixed the water?

233
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,990
这可没有那么简单
It's not that simple.

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,990
水管是在监狱里的
The water pipes are inside the prison.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,590
电线却可能是在地底
The electrical lines are probably running underground

236
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,490
沿着墙外排布的
along an exterior wall,

237
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,100
意味着电线在外面的
which means they're out there somewhere

238
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,200
某个禁入区
in no-man's-land.

239
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,290
那你能恢复电力吗?
So, you can fix the power?

240
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,190
上次我看到他们射杀了出去的人
Last I checked, they shoot prisoners who go out there.

241
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,900
所以我觉得答案是"不行"
So I'm thinking the answer is"no."

242
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,800
听我说
You listen to me,

243
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,200
听清楚了 小子
and you listen closely, water boy.

244
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
不管情况是否相似 不管有没有士兵
Like it or not, soldiers or not,

245
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,700
你要去禁入区
you're going out into no-man's-land.

246
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
这是自杀式任务
It's a suicide mission.

247
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,590
我要打几个电话
I'll make some calls.

248
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
-你要确保我安全 -尽我所能吧
And you're going to keep meafe? As best I can.

249
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,190
我觉得我做不到
I don't think I can do this.

250
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,400
不 不 不 你会帮我的
No, no, no, no, no. You will help me with this.

251
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,790
我也会为你做点事情的
Look, I will do something for you.

252
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,290
我会给你一个新枕头
I'll get you a new pillow,

253
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,500
鹅毛的 像我的那样 或者一台小电视
goose-feather like mine, or a small TV.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
好吧
All right.

255
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,800
给我那间房间
Get me that.

256
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,890
-为什么? -这里可以享受早上第一缕阳光
Why? It's the first one to get sunlight in the morning.

257
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
你给我那间囚室 我给你电力
You get me that cell, I'll get you electricity.

258
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,600
好啊林肯
Hey, Linc.

259
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,300
兄弟 我很快就要离开你了
Look, bro, um, I'm going to be out of your way real soon.

260
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,390
我看到哥伦比亚招移民工人的小广告
I saw these flyers for migrant workers in Colombia.

261
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,290
现在是咖啡豆的收获季节
It's coffee bean season,

262
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,890
他们让巴拿马人去干活
and they're letting Panamanians in,

263
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,000
所以我想 换张身份证我就可以过关了
so I figure, with a good ID, I can pass.

264
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,300
大巴今天发车 好吗?
Bus leaves today, okay?

265
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,790
好吧 在你离开这儿之前 伙计 我

我要见个人 我需要一个翻译
I'm meeting someone, and I need a translator.

267

林肯我很欣赏你做的每件事 
Linc, uh I appreciate everything you've done 

268
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,990
只需要几个小时
It'll just be a couple hours.

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,400
几个小时就够了
Just a couple hours, that's it.

270
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,090
我15岁时 我堂兄给了我一份工作
When I was 15, my cousin told me about a job that only lasts

271
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,090
只消几小时 我却在少教所待了三个月
a few hours and, uh, I got three months in juvie.

272
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,190
没有你我做不到
I can't do this without you.

273
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,790
我在巴拿马 我不会说西班牙语 
I'm in Panama, I don't speak the language 

274
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,590

And I can't miss that bus.

275
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,390
我要挣钱 寄回家
I'm going ake money and send it home.

276
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,990
偷偷摸摸也好 我要做爸爸了 林肯
Underground or not, I'm going to be a dad, Linc,

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,400
你和其他人不一样 应该理解
and you out of all people should understand that.

278
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,500
我和詹姆斯聊过
I spoke to James.

279
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,290
他确认了你和我说的
He confirmed what you told me

280
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,500
越狱的事情

我要你帮个忙
I just have one favor to ask.

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,700
只是要在门外
It's just outside of the gate.

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
你可以带你的人来
You, you can bring your men.

289
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,000

是钢笔 写字的钢笔
but the pen. Pen. Pen.

308
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,590
没有 只有绘画笔
No, pintura.

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,100
是的 绘画笔
Yeah, yeah, pintura. Yeah.

310
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,300
他要离开你
He's leaving you.

311
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,190
他要离开你 他走了
He's leaving you, he'll be gone,

312
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
你要困在这个迷宫里了
and you'll be stuck in this maze forever.

313
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,590
谢谢你帮我们安排这些 长官
Thank you for arranging this for us, Colonel.

314
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,390
我也要拿走一些东西

315
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,500
我保证
I assure you.

316
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,900
你确定你可以解决电力问题?
You know you can fix this electric problem?

317
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,790
在开始挖之前我不能确定
I won't know for sure until we can start digging,

318
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,500
但是 我想可以的
but yes, I think so.

319
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,490
我的人会打爆你的头
My men will shoot you in t back of the head

320
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,400
如果你老看着围墙的话 明白?
if you so much as look at the fence, eh?

321
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,390
还有你 老大 如果有事情发生
And you, patron, if anything goes wrong.

322
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,590
不仅仅是他小命不保
it will not only be his life that is lost.

323
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
你也得承担责任
You have my word on that.

324
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,700
长官 不用担心
No worries, Colonel.

325
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,500
我会让这小子规规矩矩的
I'll keep this boy in line.

326
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,690
我也来挖
I'll dig.

327
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,990
我不要你帮忙
I don't need your help.

328
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,590
来吧 不要骄傲
Hey, come on, now, don't be proud.

329
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,500
我昨天恰好听到了你的谈话
I heard you talking just yesterday.

330
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,990
和马宏的谈话
Talking to Mahone.

331
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,800
你知道 关于美国人如何联合起来
You know, about how us Americans should stick together.

332
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,100
也会帮我离开这里的 对吧 迈克?

333
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,100
这是什么 66年还是67年的?
What is it, a '66 or a '67?

334
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,790
-什么? -你的车
erdon? Your car.

335
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
他在问你的气缸的年代
El quiere saber el ano.

336
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,200
看这里
ste aqui?

337

对 是66年的
Pues, es un '66.

338
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,390
还是我做的贡献
Y es mi preciosa.

339
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,490
66年的
66.

340
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,200
恩 这是什么 325马力?
Uh-huh. What is it, 325 horses?

375马力

344
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
抱歉
Perdon a me, srita. Mm-hmm.

345
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,990
-他在说什么? -他认出我了 但是
What's he saying? recognizes me, but

346
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,790
他没意识到那是在监狱
he doesn't realize it was at the prison.

347
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,390
问问他 是否想赚点钱
Ask him does he want to make enough cash

348
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,500
在下周把车子重新上个漆
to get this car cherry by next week?

349
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,200
他知道我们不是在讨论车子
He knows we're not talking about cars.

350
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,100
没错
That's right.

351
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,290
斯科菲尔德 我知道你要离开这里
Come on, Scofield, I know you're getting out of here.

352
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,690
我听到了关于你和英国佬的事情
I heard it all about you and the limey.

353
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,490
老兄 我只是在修复电力
I'm just fixing the electricity, Boss.

354
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,890
是的 我没有伙伴 因为我很挑剔
Yeah, right, and I'm just single 'cause I'm choosy.

355
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,790
别逼我到处说我知道的
Don't make me tell anyone what I know.

356
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,090
你知道了什么?
What is it you think you know?

357
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,890
所谓"公司"的人想让你进来这儿
Somebody called"the Company"wanted you in here

358
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,390
和那个叫惠斯勒的家伙合作
to work with that Whistler guy.

359
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,390
-没错吧? -什么"公司"?
Am I warm? What's the Company?

360
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,490
他们要惠斯勒干吗?
What do they want with Whistler?

361
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
我不知道 但是你知道
I don't know, but you do.

362
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,090
看来你知道的并不多
Doesn't sound like you know much after all.

363
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,790
我不需要知道
I don't need to know

364
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,890
臭气熏天的时候
how to change a diaper

365
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,200
要怎么换尿布
to know when it stinks to high hell.

366
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,990
你是有目的的 斯科菲尔德
You're doing something here, Scofield.

367
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
没错 是的
You're right. I am.

368
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,400
我在恢复供电
I'm fixing the electricity.

369
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,990
你要来帮忙挖吗?
Now, you wanted to help dig?

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,200
那就挖吧
Dig.

371
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,300
就是这儿了
Hey, this is it.

372
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,190
我想我们不只是在做电工活吧
I assume we're doing more than just than playing electrician.

373
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,500
别担心
Don't worry.

374
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
我知道我在干什么
We're exactly where we need to be.

375
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,500
我觉得太热了 斯科菲尔德
Heat's getting to me, Scofield.

376
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,000
该休息了
It's quitting time.

377
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,590
你介意告诉我 他怎么会在这里吗
You mind telling me why he's even out here with us?

378
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,500
他猜到点什么
He knows something's up.

379
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,190
该死的 他怎么会知道的
How the hell does he know that?

380
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,000
只能说 我还是有点名气的
Let's just say I have a bit of a rep.

381
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,800
因为福克斯河的事情?
From Fox River?

382
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,300
我知道你是谁 伙计
I know who you are, mate.

383
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,200
最近才知道的
Figured it out just lately.

384
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,290
终于明白为什么他们会把你送进来
Finally made sense why they pick you

385
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,800
而不是其他人
of all people to send here.

386
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,800
别担心
No worries.

387
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,100
保管你的小秘密 对我有好处
It's in my interest to keep your little secret.

388
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,190
但是贝利克?
But Bellick?

389
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,900
不能相信他
Can't be trusted.

390
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,790
我可以搞定贝利克
I can handle Bellick.

391
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,500
他不在计划内
He's not in on this.

392
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,690
好 好吧
Okay, good.

393
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,100
但是马宏在
But Mahone is.

394
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,900
马宏?
Mahone?

395
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,090
他像个病猫似的
He's looking abouts stable as a three-legged chair,

396
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,290
他要跟我们一起越狱?
and he's escaping with us?

397
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
不 只是他自己那么以为
No, he just thinks he is.

398
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,990
他需要镇静剂
He needs his meds.

399
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,690
否则他会疯掉
Without them, he'll self destruct.

400
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,500
只是时间问题
It's just a matter of time.

401
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,700
要是他没疯呢
And if he doesn't?

402
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,500
我会骗他 告诉他他想知道的
I'll string him along, tell him what he wants to hear,

403
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,700
然后摆脱他
and then I'll cut him loose.

404
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,800
我怎么知道你不会对我做同样的事?
How do I know you're not going to do the same thing to me?

405
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,500
你不用知道
You don't.

406
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,500
需要帮助吗 我的朋友
You need a hook-up, my friend?

407
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,590
不用了
No.

408
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,090
别着急
Take your time.

409
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,600
我可不强买强卖
I don't hard sell.

410
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,890
我的货品不会让你后悔的
My pduct speaks for itself.

411
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,490
在外面 我使用一些药品
Outside, I took something.

412
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,290
一些需要医师处方才可买到的药 叫Varatril
It's a prescription drug called Varatril,

413
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,700
我在想 你是不是可以 
and I was wondering if you 

414
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,890
这里可没药房
This ain't no farmacia.

415
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,500
但是我这有 
But what I got right here 

416
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,090
比所有美国医生给你的东西
it's bter than anything your doctor

417
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,800
还要好
gave you back in the States.

418
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,190
那是焦油
That's tar.

419
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,090
来尝尝 就一点
Just take a taste, algo pequenito.

420
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,300
你知道的 要有约束
You know, keep it in check.

421
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,300
我现在没钱
I don't have any money right now.

422
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,990
那我也没药
Then I don't have any drugs.

423
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,690
但是对个男人来说 在索纳
But there are a few ways for a man

424
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,090
还是有些办法可以赚点小钱的
to make a few dollars in Sona 

425
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,690
满足其他人的需要 
servicing the needs of others 

426
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,690
我个人是不感兴趣 
not something I'm into 

427
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,300
你觉得我是个废物?
You think I'm a punk?

428
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,890
我只是在帮你
I'm just helping you

429
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,800
好起来 朋友 只是帮你好起来
get well, friend, just helping you get well.

430
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,500
勒齐先生
Ser Lechero?

431
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,500
勒齐先生
Ser Lechero.

432
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,390
你想要什么
What do you want?

433
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,290
我知道你是大忙人 但我想告诉你
Look, I know you're a busy man, but I wanted to tell ya,

434
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,390
我不知道迈克・斯科菲尔德到底在干什么
I don't know exactly what he's doing,

435
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,600
-但他只是拿你做垫脚石 -不是的 猪
but Michael Scofield's taking you for a ride. No, cerdo,

436
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,590
我不那么认为
I don't think so.

437
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,190
听着 昨天我听他说关于越狱的事
Listen, I heard him talking about escape yesterday 

438
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,490
-关于逃离这里 -他说要越狱
about breaking outta here. It's he's talking about escape,

439
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,000
为什么你跑来告诉我 而不是跟他一起
why are you here telling me and you're not going with him, eh?

440
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,490
如果他肯我当然愿意 但是他已拒绝我了
I would if he'd let me, but he's already cut me out.

441
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,490
他说他没事 但是我知道
He says he's square, but I know

442
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,290
那个狗娘养的在计划点什么
the son of a bitch is up to something.

443
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,390
所以我想
So I figured,

444
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,790
如果我不能逃跑 我也许该告诉你
if I ain't running, I might asl tell you

445
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,290
然后我在这的日子会好过点
and make my time in here a little bit easier.

446
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,990
每个人都幻想逃出索纳监狱
Every man fantasizes about escaping from Sona.

447
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,890
对 但不是每个人都可以在禁入区用铁铲铲地
Yeah, but they aren't all in no-man's-land with shovels.

448
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,990
铁铲是我给他的 轰他出去
I'm gave him the shovels. Get him out.

449
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,790
我和你一样 也给过他铁铲 还有帮手
I gave him shovels too, and guys to work with, just like you.

450
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,100
我在他越狱的监狱工作
I worked in the prison he broke out of.

451
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,990
他说他是在帮我忙
He said he was doing me a favor 

452
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,590
修理火灾引起的破坏 他点的火
fixing damage from a fire he started.

453
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,790
而你知道我得到什么了吗
And you know what I got?

454
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,600
四肢被捆 被丢在我自己监狱的下水道里
Hog-tied and left in a pipe under my own prison.

455
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,700
他做不了什么的
There's nothing he can do.

456
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,890
有士兵看着呢
The soldiers are watching him.

457
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,490
我也曾那么想
That's what I thought,

458
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,800
直到他挖地道到我的保卫室
until he tunneled out ofy guard's room.

459
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,490
我在外面的接线盒里埋了些东西
He's buried something in a junction box out there

460
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,190
然后用土盖住 我都看见了
and covered it with dirt I saw him.

461
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,790
你可以亲自去看
Go see for yourself.

462
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
我要是骗你就不得好死
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

463
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,200
你在索纳总是不顺心 是吧?
Trouble keeps finding you here in Sona, doesn't it?

464
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,400
我们来散散步吧
Let's take a walk, eh?

465
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,090
有传言说你在耍我
There are rumors about that you are trying to trick me.

466
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,490
你让我做什么我就做什么
I'm just doing what I'm told.

467
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,490
为了你的小命着想 最好那是真话
Oh? Let's hope for your sake that's true.

468
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,490
嗯?
Hmm? 

469
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,100
为了确认一下
But justmake sure,

470
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,600
我们去禁入区吧
let's go on out to no-man's-land

471
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,600
看看你埋了什么
and see what you buried there.

472
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,490
只是想要确认下
Just want to make sure

473
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,790
我的人是否在为长官认真工作
my men are doing a good job for the colonel.

474
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,200
过去
Get in there.

475
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,000
过去
Get in there.

476
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,700
打开它
Open it.

477
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,890
把土扒开
Move the dirt.

478
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,100
现在就做 
Now 

479
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,090
这是传输管胶带
It's duct tape.

480
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,390
修补磨损的电线
To fix the frayed wires.

481
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,900
这就是为什么电力这么不稳定的原因
That's why the power was so inconsistent.

482
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,800
我不想这些胶带松掉
I didn't want the tape to come loose,

483
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,500
所以用土盖住
so I packed it down with dirt.

484
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,100
棒极了
Beautiful.

485
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,000
你要去哪
Where are you going?

486
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,490
我得去把主开关打开
I got to turn the main power switch back on.

487
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
我把它关掉了 因而我们能安全工作
I had to turn it off, so we could work on the wires safely.

488
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,790
我要跟你一起
I'll come with you.

489
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,990
只是去拉一下开关
It's just a switch.

490
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,490
我可以自己来
I can handle it myself.

491
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,200
你是可以 但是你不能这么做
You can but you won't.

492
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,300
送水的小子 在这里呢
Hey, water boy, it's back here.

493
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,090
我不需要项链 只这个十字架
I don't need the chain, just the cross.

494
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,090
它的大小适合 而且不是真金
It's the perfect size and it's not real gold,

495
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
所以我不会触电
so it won't conduct current.

496
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,490
电路一直循环
Keep the circuit open 

497
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,290
即使总开关打开了
no power even when the main switch

498
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,190
也没有电
is turned on.

499
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
把十字架拿出来 
Take the cross out 

500
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
索纳的灯又亮了
Sona lights up again.

501
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,790
如果勒齐知道你们在电上搞鬼 
Lechero find out you messed with his electric 

502
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,890
你就死定了
you're dead.

503
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,200
他永远不会发现的
That's why he can't ever find out.

504
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,800
现在 别想让我接应你
Now, don't make me come get you.

505
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,900
这里没有人能帮你
Nobody back there can help you.

506
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,890
这 
Uh, it's 

507
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,100
出了点问题
It's some kind of mistake.

508
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,900
这应该行得通的
It should be working.

509
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,990
我唯一的错误在于相信你
The only mistake I made was trusting you.

510
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
萨米
Sammy.

511
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,990
变压器有延迟
Transformer delay.

512
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,490
这是座古老的监狱
It's an old prison.

513
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,100
现在 如果你不介意
Now, if you don't mind 

514
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
我想搬进我的新牢房
I'd like to move into my new cell.

515
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,090
谢谢你的提醒 哥们
Thank you for your words before, blanco.

516
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,900
为勒齐工作
Working for Lechero,

517
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,690
是件苦差事 了解?
not an easy field to plow, comprende?

518
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,200
是呀 是呀 我知道
Oh, yeah, yeah, I comprend.

519
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,590
你和我 我们是
You and me, we're

铁哥们 我是尼弗斯
amigos, Nieves.

521
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,190
当勒齐心情好的时候
When Lechero is in a better mood,

522
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,800
我会去帮你美言几句
I'm going to put in a goodord, help you,

523
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,800
怎么说的来着 知恩图报
how you say,"move up the ladder."

524
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,490
我很感动
I appreciate

525
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,090
但是

526
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,290
我的经验是

上帝会帮助那些想自救的人
that God helps those that help themselves.

528
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
上帝与你同在
Vaya con Dios.

529
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,190
15000美元
$15,000 

530
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,600
-为什么? -因为那就是他想要的

-你要我呆在这里空等? -我不在乎你做什么
You expect me to stay here and wait? I don't care what you do.

539
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,600
你不在乎? 你不在乎谁啊?
You don't care? Who the hell are you to say you don't care?

540
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,290
你不是唯一一个受此事牵连的人

是的 我知道 这正是问题所在

542
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,990
那你还要继续去我行我素?
But you will still just run off and do whatever you want?

543
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,590
你这人怎么

他们杀了莎拉 把她的头放在了盒子里

545

他们绑架了我儿子

546
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,590
林肯 对不起
Oh, Linc, I'm . I'm sorry.

勒齐想和你谈谈
Lechero wants to talk to you.

549

我只是去整了整头发
I was just about to get a little trim.

550
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,990
勒齐说我可以找任何人的
Lechero said I was looking all bhuttu 

551
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,100

如果你明知他在注射 却不告诉我

他的死就算到你头上

559
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,790
拜托 拜托 拜托
Patron, Patron, Patron 

560
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,690
毒品的事我一无所知
I don't know nothing about drugs.

561
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,500
真不知道
I don't. I don't.

562
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,790
我是说 上帝呀 我 
I mean, hell, I 

563
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,890
我12岁就开始吸大麻
I tried me some reefer when I was 12,

564
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,600
我只剩半条命了

那好
That's good.

567
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,800
蒂博格
Teodoro.

568
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,000
似乎队伍不好带了
There appears to be an opening on my crew.

569
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,190
麦格雷迪 你的十字架还给你

你真有才
You're a real smart guy.

572
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,000
你究竟来监狱干什么?
What the hell are you doing in prison?

573
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,500
给
Here.

574

很好
It's perfect.

575
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,900
你怎么拿到它的?
How did you get it?

576
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,600
这是你想要的 对么?
It's what you wanted, right?

577
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,400
是的

那么接下来干什么?
So what's the next step?

580

静观其变
Uh we wait.

581
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,200
保持联络
And I'll keep you posted.

582
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,500
你知道你在干嘛么?
You know what you need to do.

583
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,100
你怎么想?
What do you think?

584
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,700
当在那修复电力时
When i fix electricity for reason,

585
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,190
不可能从围墙出去
but it can't have been to make that fence sizzle

586
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,490
那样是白白送死
like the third bloody rail.

587
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,190
除非你想让狱官幸灾乐祸
Unless you want to make the colonel happy.

588
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,890
事实上 这对我们都好
Actually, it's in both of our best

589
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,700
就让围墙尽可能成为不可逾越的死亡线

590
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,790
现在我们要做的

很不错

你说过15000美元的
You said $15,000 

599
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,290
15000不过是说说的

602
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,300
我要更多
i want big cash

603
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,090
明白吗

604
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,200
冷静
calm down

605
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,000
看看你是不是要这个
if it's money you want

606

不要 不要 不要
No, no, no 

607
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,290
你他妈的在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

我们需要他 
We need him He will sell us

609

他拿到了我们的钱后
out to the cops after he takes

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,600
就会把我们出卖给警察的
as much as he can from us.

611
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,700
他在打包了
He's packing up to go.

612
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,100
杀了他
Kill him.

613
