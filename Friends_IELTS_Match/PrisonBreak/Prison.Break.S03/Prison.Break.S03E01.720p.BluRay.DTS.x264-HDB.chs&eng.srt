你得想想办法 我弟弟是无辜的

对此我也无能为力
Look,there's nothing I can do about that.

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,960
你当然能
Of course there is

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,900
再去犯罪现场看看 定能证实清白

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,130
你看 我不过是个夜间办事员而已
Look,I'm a night clerk,okay?

你若真想解决问题
If you want someone who can really do something,

8
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,700
最好等领事来
you're gonna have to wait for the consul

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,960
他早上才上班
he gets in in the morning.

10
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,730
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,560
那我自己来搞定
That ain't gonna cut it.

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,900
你兄弟
Your brother,

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
关在哪个监狱?

怎么了?

那里关的都是最穷凶极恶的罪犯

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,930
别的监狱都不收

一年前 他们野蛮暴动过
They rioted so badly a year ago,

19
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,100
守卫都撤了出来
the guards pulled out,

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,030
留下他们自生自灭

成千上万的小偷 强奸犯 杀人犯
A thousand thieves,rapists,murderers.

22
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,300
政府干脆退避三舍
The government just stays back,

23
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,430
保持他们的原样
keeps the perimeter.

都说那是"单行道"
To them,Sona's a one-way street.

只有进

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,330
没有出
never comes out 

27
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,360
除非死了
unless it's dead.

28
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,670
此人未证实有罪
Somebody didn't do their due diligence on this guy,

29
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,770
我们要求将他转移至更 
and we need him moved to a facility that's a little

30
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,870
适合的机构
more moderate.

31
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,470
行吗?

35
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,470
你无需再担心什么了
You got nothing to worry about.

36
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,700
我担心我弟弟
Just my brother.

37

好吧 你们俩的事迹传得很神
Right. Well,that's a heck of a story,you two.

38
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,300
消息甚至传到了这
That made the news even down here.

39
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,400
我听说你还有个儿子
And I understand you have a son as well?

40
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,330
-没错 -叫LJ 小林肯?
-Yeah. Uh-huh. -LJ Lincoln Jr.?

41

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,730
还没联系上他

-我们派人去 -我自己能搞定

让我们还是先关注迈克吧

好的 好消息是
Okay,well,good news is is that much

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,130
你所说的一切与犯罪现场吻合
of what you're saying is checking out at the crime scene.

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,600
被害人的确有一把特工专用左轮手枪
The victim did have a service revolver

49
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,400
上面刻有政府编号
with U.S. government numbers on it.

50
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,830
凶器既然已经发现
And if a weapon was found,then that lends

51
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,570
那么对自卫一说提供了有利物证
real credence to self-defense as a motive.

52
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,270
很好
Great.

53
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,770
他们有没有发现别的?
They,uh,find anything else?

54
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,700
-比如说哪方面? -包
-Like what? -A bag.

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,830
里面有什么?
What was in it?

56
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,700
有些钱吧
A little money.

57
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,830
没有发现 不好意思
No,sorry.

58
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,930
没关系
Of course they didn't.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
不管发生什么情况
Yeah,well,whatever the case,

60
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,930
对于你兄弟而言
regarding your brother,I have managed

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,500
我都会设法做些改变
to make a little headway.

我已作出了安排

63

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,270
明天就能生效

那里要安全
It's a lot safer,

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,330
-干净得多 -很好
-it's a lot cleaner. -Great.

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,830
如我所想那样 会有足够的证据
And if this is stacking up like I think it is,

68
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,300
我有十足的把握 所有控告都会撤销
I'd be pretty confident the charges will be dropped.

69
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,300
他会无罪释放?
He'd be free?

70
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,600
可能还要面对美国方面的指控
Well,he'd still face charges in the U.S.

71
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,670
但那是出狱以后的事了?
But out of there?

72
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,870
没错

求求你了

这里倒是有些水

去死吧
Bite me.

80
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,330
你说什么?
What'd you say?

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,530
我什么也没说

你还好吧?
How are you doing?

89

阿历克斯 你想怎样?
What do you want,Alex?

90
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,530
你太聪敏了 居然想出在船上放毒品栽赃
You're so clever like planting the drugs on the boat.

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,700

你会告诉大家事实你计划了这一切
And you will tell the truth that you planted this

99
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,330
你设计栽赃 我就可以回家了
and you set this up,and I'm gonna go home.

100
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,930
这太嘲讽了 我对天发誓是你设的局
That's funny,I could have sworn you set this up.

101
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,530
我设的局? 我被关在这儿
I set this up? I'm in here.

102
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,030
幕后者到底对我有何企图?
What does the Company want with me?

103
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,170
为什么挑选巴拿马?
Why Panama?

104
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,500
你觉得我这样子像知道这一切吗?
What,you think I know what they wanted?

105
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,130
我受他们控制

106
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,800
听命于他们
I did what they asked me to do

107

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,000
并移送回来

这 这一切 
That's it. That's,that's

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,330
这一切现在听来都是旧事了
That's old news,huh?

从今天开始 我们重新回归正途

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,230
就想起那个杀了我父亲的凶手
all I can see is the man who killed my father.

116
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,570

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,600
推销?
Selling?

159
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,500
我只是想跟你说说篮球
I just want to talk basketball.

160
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,730
你喜欢哪个球队?
Who's your team?

161
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,370
小子 跟我们走
Let's go,blanco.

162
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,370
带你熟悉下环境
Orientation.

163
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,400
我没兴趣
I'm not interested.

164
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,300
没你选的份
It's not for you to decide.

165
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,370
守卫说我得在15分钟后离开
Guards say I have to be out in 15 minutes.

166
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,430
把他们带进来
Bring them in.

167
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,900
我真希望他们没让你们吃什么苦头
Well,I hope they haven't been treating you too poorly.

168
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,100
如果有的话 我应该有所耳闻了
I should hear of it if you have.

169
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,300
我想你们能看出这地方与众不同
I think as you can tell,Sona is unlike any other place in the world.

170
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,400
那帮守卫去年仓皇而逃
Huh? Since the riots of last year,they left us here to rot.

171
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,000
他们认为我们会内耗而亡
They figured we would just destroy ourselves,

172
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,800
恰恰相反 我们队伍更壮大了
but instead,we've thrived.

173
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,430
借助于巴拿马运河
With the canal,Panama is now

174
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,230
巴拿马现在成了全球罪犯的孵化基地
a breeding ground for international crime.

175
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,230
我们这的人来自27个不同国家
27 different nationalities we have here.

176
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,830
但不是一个帮派的
But not one gang.

177
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,370
没有一起种族歧视案例
Not one racially-motivated incident.

178
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,300
这都归功于我
It's just me.

179
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,600
平等主义
Egalitarianism

180
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,900
这是我的信仰
I believe is the word.

181
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,400
你不同意吗?
Huh? Did I get that right?

182
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,170
你说是就是了
Right as rain.

183
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,830
操练一下果然长进了
That's what practice does for you.

184
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,270
你们有什么要向我汇报的吗?
Now,is there anything you want to tell me?

185
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,730
我想知道你们被关进来的原因
Any history that you bring to this place that I should know about?

186
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,630
我想你没说实话
I don't think you're quite telling me the truth,

187
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,500
斯科菲尔德先生
Mr. Scofield.

188
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,470
我们已经听到了风声 老兄
We get the news,man.

189
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,170
你在CNN上俨然是个超级明星了
You were quite the superstar on CNN.

190
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,570
救出了你哥后
Man breaks brother out 

191
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,330
然后逃亡到巴拿马
and flees to Panama.

192
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,430
但在这你可行不通了
But you're not a superstar here 

193
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,600
你没意识到这点吗?
You realize that,don't you?

194
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,130
我不想在起什么波澜
I'm not going to make waves.

195
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,500
凭你的能耐也办不到
It wouldn't be within your power.

196
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,270
我也听说过你们俩
I heard about the two of you.

197
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,570
你们今天闯祸了
You two in the hall today.

198
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,700
但你俩如果想解决问题的话
Now,if you would like to sort your problems out,

199
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,330
方法很简单
it's very simple here.

200
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,630
两人之间意见不同
A man has a beef with another,he makes his problem known.

201
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,230
就直接用男人的方式解决问题
And then we deal with it directly

202
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,400
就在那里
as men over there.

203
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,470
没那个必要
Won't be necessary.

204
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,470
你一直那样发抖的吗
You always shake like that?

205
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,170
还是仅仅出于对某人的畏惧
Or just when you're scared of someone?

206
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,170
你呢?
What about you?

207
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,570
老大 不要伤害我
Dont hurt me man.

208
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,570
我不想惹什么麻烦
I dont want any trouble.

209
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,170
蠢货 绝不允许
Asshole Never

210
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,150
永远别在我的地盘随地大小便 
Never use my floor as a bathroom 

211
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,430
我想他明白了
I think he gets the message.

212
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,700
我们两个可以单挑
We could go you and me 

213
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,370
就在这里
right here.

214
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,900
你真有胆识
You're a brave man,huh?

215
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,270
有种
Brave man.

216
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,870
你很幸运 我现在温和多了
You're lucky I've been meditating.

217
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,630
换作以前 早一枪毙了你
Before,I couldn't take my finger off the trigger,but now 

218
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,300
但我现在懂得了控制情绪
now I have mind control.

219
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,370
完全的控制
Complete control.

220
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,730
思想
Mind 

221
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,570
身体
body 

222
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,870
还有灵魂
and soul.

223
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,770
滚出去吧 
Get out 

224
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,470
快滚 
Get out 

225
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,270
浪费我们的时间
He's a waste of our time.

226
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,070
谁能想象索纳出了这样的风云人物
Who would have thought a famous person in Sona.

227
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,630
弱者总是延续弱势
Weak people rally around fame.

228
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,100
他们祈祷上苍 他们对此深信不疑
They worship it. They're blinded by it.

229
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,030
正如你所知
And as you can tell,there are many people

230
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,730
这里还有很多弱者
of weak character behind these walls.

231
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,670
没错 他们会跟随像这样的人
Yes,they will follow a man like this,

232
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,500
他们会给他立碑纪念
and they will put him on a pedestal.

233
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,830
他很有魅力 是吗 宝贝?
He has that charisma,right,mami?

234
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,670
他可比不上你
He's no you.

235
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,430
宝贝 你不用来迎合我
Ah,you don't have to pander me,mami.

236
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,300
我可不是三岁小孩
Soy un hombre maduro.

237
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,470
他很帅 不是吗?
He's good looking,right?

238
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,970
没错 他是很帅
Si. He is good looking.

239
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,170
他是这里最帅的 不是吗?
He's the best looking man in the prison,right?

240
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,830
和你不能比
Not compared to you.

241
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,830
宝贝 让我来告诉你
Let me tell you, mammi.

242
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,830
谁知道呢
Who knows

243
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,830
或许是吧
Maybe

244
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,130
臭婊子 给我滚蛋
Pack up, whore.

245
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,430
别让我再看到你
You are gone.

246
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,520
莎拉 
Sara 

247
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,570
莎拉 唐克瑞蒂是个美国人
Sara Tancredi she's an American.

248
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,770
她失踪了
She's missing.

249
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,900
我们没有她的任何消息
We don't have a report of anything like that.

250
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,200
但如果有的话 给我电话 号码在背面
But if you do,you call me;the number's on the back.

251
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,400
好的 先生
Okay,ser.

252
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,400
有任何消息就打给我 好吗?
Anything,you call me,all right?

253
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,400
会的
Will do.

254
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,940
谢谢
Thank you.

255
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,300
你哪弄来的鞋子?
Where'd you get shoes?

256
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,860
该干活还钱付租金了
It's time to start earning your rent around here.

257
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,910
这里不用租金的
There's no rent here.

258
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,400
-这是监狱 -继续说啊
It's prison.Keep talking.

要上去了
It's going up.

干活时间到了
Work time's started right now.

262

哪?
Where?

263
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,170
哦 不
Uh-uh. Hell no.

264
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,400
绝对没门
Absolutely not.

265
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,600
再敢放屁
One more word from you,

266
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,170
我让你吃屎 明白没?
and I will drown you in here,you understand?

267
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,570
快点 干活
Now,work.

268
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,200
做完后拿去下水道烧掉
Burn it down in the sewers when you're done.

269
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,170
有新人来了

270
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,370
一个美国人

271
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,300
还有别的事么?

272
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,200
他有只假手

273
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,440
斯科菲尔德 有人来看你了

277
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
找我什么事
What do you want?

278
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,300
说实话 是来代表你的
Well,to be frank,to represent you.

279
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,900
-你是律师? -算是吧
You're a lawyer? Of sorts.

280
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,970
法院已经指派了律师给我
The court already appointed me a lawyer.

281
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,440
那或许我可以用别的方法帮你
Then perhaps I can be of assistance in a different way.

282
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,440
我有点怀疑
Somehow I doubt that.

283
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,000
我的靠山可厉害者呢 斯科菲尔德先生
I got a lot of big guns behind me,Mr. Scofield,

284
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,440
你或许会需要他们的
people you might like to have in your corner

285
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,970
你是否该考虑下 越狱呢
should you ever decide,say to break out of here.

286
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,070
你是谁?
Who are you?

287
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,040
我们可以从各方面帮助你
We can assist you in every possible way

288
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,840
一旦你能越过那道墙
once you get past that wall.

289
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,270
像你这样一个身怀绝技的人
There's a reason a guy like you,

290
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,500
被关到这是有原因的 知道么
with your skill set,was put in here,you know.

291
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,300
谈话到此为止
This conversation's over.

292
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,170
斯科菲尔德 你得听听我说的
You ought to hear what I have to say,Scofield.

293
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,040
我们想让事情简单点
We're trying to do this the easy way.

294
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,440
你他妈搞什么 敢动我东西?
What the hell are you doing taking my stash?

295
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,440
说啊 小娘们
Cough it up,you little bitch.

296
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,270
-我没拿 -东西在哪?
I didn't do it. Where is it? 

297
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,140
-在哪? -不是我
Where is it? It wasn't me.

298
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,170
你懂私自斗殴的规矩吧
You know the rules about extra-curricular fights 

299
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
这里可行不通
It doesn't happen here.

300
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,270
他拿走了属于我的东西
He took something that belongs to me.

301
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
他不大正常
He's out of his mind.

302
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,600
这事很容易弄明白
Well,it seems pretty easy to get to the bottom of this

303
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,200
搜他的身
check him.

304
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,000
检查他的地方
Check his area.

305
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,270
真见鬼
That's bull.

306
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,140
你们都是
You're both

307
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,770
贱人
scumbags.

308
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,440
伙计 你和我
You and me,man.

309
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,640
我们还没完呢
We're not done here.

310
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,070
你见过这个女的没有
You haven't seen her?

311
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,800
有长得相似的入住过吗
No one like this has checked in?

312
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,040
先生 抱歉没有见过
No Sir.

313
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
你真的确定吗
You're absolutely sure?

314
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,600

316
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,640
布鲁斯先生 我是伊萨斯队长
Mr. Burrows. Captain Itzuris

317
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,000
正在治安官的办公室里
at the constable's office.

318
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,670
我们找到了一个美国女人
We found an American woman

319
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,040
符合你对你朋友唐克瑞蒂小姐的描述
matching the description of your friend,Ms. Tancredi.

320
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
在哪
Where?

321
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,140
停尸房
At the morgue.

322
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,200
他说的什么
What's he saying?

323
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,600
我们不能吃这些
That we can't eat.

324
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,100
那我们应该吃什么
What are we supposed to eat?

325
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,100
求你了 来这一周 我都没进过食
Please. I haven't eaten in the week since i have been here..

326
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,070
他们想要我们像狗一样的讨食
They expect us to forage,like dogs.

327
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,570
我会死的 怎么都是死
I'll die.I will literally die.

328
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,440
伙计 那就死好了
Hang in there,man.

329
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,770
自娱自乐吧 帅哥
Playing by yourself.Same old Pretty.

330
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,270
就是不大合群啊 对吧
Just not good at making friends,are you?

331
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,070
我们之间没什么好说的
We got nothing to say to each other.

332
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,540
换个角度来说
On another note,

333
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,640
如果这是一部由政府导演的大片
on a big picture note,them big government types

334
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
把我陷害得这么惨
that shook me down so hard,

335
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,600
为什么他们要把你搞到这里来
why is it they wanted you here?

336
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,240
索纳监狱就是他们的兴趣所在?
Was it Sona they was interested in?

337
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,600
我就是这么想的
That's what I'm thinking.

338
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,070
想让我到这个烂乡下地方来把你搅晕
Want me to get you down here,up in this very county.

339
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,900
你是怎么认为的?
What do you think it is,huh?

340
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,100
你认为真有人会对索纳监狱有兴趣?
You think it's Sona?

341
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,240
谁会对这种破烂地方有兴趣?
Who'd be interested in a dump like this?

342
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,570
有人逃跑
Runner Runner 

343
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,240
不 不
No No 

344
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
谢谢您通知我
Thanks for getting back to me.

345
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,200
不用谢
No problem.

346
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,530
尸体今天上午被钓出池塘
The body was fished out of the pond

347
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,560
-今早发现的第一件 -在哪里发现的?
-first thing this morning. -Where?

348
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,200
卡雷 瑟森塔赛思
Calle Sesenta-Seis.

349
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,960
就在阿凡尼达 科隆西边
Just west of Avenida Colon.

350
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,030
先生?
Sir?

351
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,230
那是我最后一次看见她的地方
That's the last place I saw her.

352
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,730
这不是她
It's not her.

353
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,200
这不是她
It's not her.

354
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,430
有人控告你
Someone's thrown the glove down on you.

355
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,860
还是很严重的事情呢 是吧?
The gauntlet,right?

356
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,000
是啊 只是我们都知道我没拿那些药
Yeah,except we both know I didn't take those drugs.

357
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,760
我不是法官
I'm not the judge.

358
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,800
我不处理这里的上诉
I don't deal in the claims people make.

359
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,360
我只确保这里得按照规则运作
I just make sure the rules are followed.

360
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,700
规则说一切冤屈的处理方法
And the rules say all grievances are dealt with

361
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,700
都是2个人到圈里决斗
two men in a ring,a fight.

362
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,700
我明天就离开了 没有必要这样
I'll be leaving tomorrow,so that won't be necessary.

363
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,800
也许对你来说没有必要
It may not be necessary to you,

364
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,130
但是对我来说很必要
but it is to me.

365
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,130
我有职责维护这里的秩序
I have a duty to maintain order here 

366
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,530
用一个铁定的合法体制来确保
an ironclad legal system that assures that

367
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,860
没人能自作主张处理他们的矛盾
no one goes independent with their grievances,

368
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,860
那可是其他监狱里常有的事
as is so often the case in other prisons.

369
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,930
在这里
Here,

370
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,060
存在着一个体制
there is a system,

371
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,300
这个体制就代表了秩序
and that system means order.

372
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,060
所以不管你是否赞同
So whether you agree with it or not

373
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,100
都和我没有关系
does not matter to me.

374
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,830
我的议程比你的更重要
There's a larger agenda than yours.

375
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,030
如果我拒绝会怎么样?
What happens if I refuse?

376
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,400
我们会去找你
We'll come for you.

377
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,900
我能保证你会得到一个
And I can guarantee you that is an outcome

378
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,400
你不喜欢的结局
that you will not like.

379
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,000
告诉我 
Tell me something 

380
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,700
你总是用计来使人决斗吗?
do you always set up your fights?

381
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,730
我和那一点关系都没有
I had nothing to do with it.

382
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,830
整个监狱和我有冲突的人
And yet the only one in this whole prison

383
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,000
至今只有你
who has a problem with me is you.

384
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,230
我会很乐意见到巨星陨落
I'd be glad to see you go down superstar 

385
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,500
继续 继续做
Go on,keep going.

386
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,800
在角落里把它烧了
You burn it around the corner.

387
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,530
伙计
Buddy.

388
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,560
可以帮我一个忙吗
Think you can do me a favor?

389
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,700
休想
Bite me.

390
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,830
我能给你吃的
I can feed you.

391
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,800
几周前 我和你一样的处境
A few weeks ago,I was in your shoes.

392
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,930
好几天没有东西吃
Didn't get any food for days.

393
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,360
他们想让我死
They'd have let me die,

394
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,860
就像他们想让你死一样
just like they're gonna let you die.

395
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,460
回到给我吃的那个话题
Get back to the"feed me"part.

396
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,130
鸡肉
Chicken.

397
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,660
伙计 你哪里来的鸡肉
Man,where'd you get chicken?

398
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,800
那不是鸡肉
That's not chicken.

399
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,460
-还要再来点吗 -要
-Want some more? -Yeah.

400
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,230
那你要帮我跑个腿
Then you're gonna have to run an errand for me.

401
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,600
跑什么腿
What kind of errand?

402
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,660
-爸爸 是我 -LJ
-Dad? It's me. -LJ.

403
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,760
你在哪里
Where are you?

404
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,200
我在巴拿马
I'm in Panama.

405
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,460
什么
What?

406
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,830
你 
How 

407
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,360
你怎么得到这个号码的
How'd you get this number?

408
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,660
我碰到莎拉
Well,I ran into Sara.

409
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,300
她从领事馆得到你的号码
She got your number from the consulate.

410
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,160
爸爸 我得挂了
Dad,I'm cutting out.

411
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,900
LJ 我听不清楚
LJ,I can't hear you,man.

412
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,530
爸爸 照我说的做
Dad,do this.

413
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,030
和我们在加菲 普莱斯大厦见面
Meet us at the restaurant in the Garfield Price building

414
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,300
在顶楼的餐馆

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,500
加菲什么
Garfield what?

416
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,460
8点半

417

决斗时间
Time to fight,blanco

418
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,230
希望你没事
Best to make your peace with God.

419
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,600
都安排好了?
all right?

420
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,100
当然
Come on

421
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,700
10对1
Ten to one.

422
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,100
没人喜欢那美国佬
No one wants the American.

423
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,900
什么?居然要10对1 
What? Even at 10-1?

424
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,060
所以他必须要投靠我们
There's a reason he chose World.

425
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,660
已经连续死了6个了 
Six consecutive life terms,okay?

426
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,660
擦干净
Clean it up.

427
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,600
我只是开个玩笑
I'm just kidding,man.

428
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,000
放心吧
Tranquilo 

429
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,860
当然啦 因为您
Surely,it's beneath a man of your status

430
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,100
在这正是把握全局
to be walking around like that

431
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,860
的核心人物
all sticky-like.

432
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,460
放了他
Leave him.

433
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,960
你什么意思
What do you propose?

434
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,800
帮您擦鞋
Ablution.

435
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,160
为了投靠您的门下
A humble sign of friendship from a stranger

436
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,730
以表达我最诚挚的善意
who's come into your house.

437
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,000
哦 对不起
Sorry about that.

438
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,230
我只是个废人
Just half a man down here.

439
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,460
你叫什么?
What's your name,

440
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,530
就叫我"朋友"好了
You can just call me"friend."

441
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
对着膝关节就是一脚
Go for the kneecap.

442
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,860
恩 就是你想的那样
You,uh you hit it

443
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,300
直接踹上去 膝关节就断了
straight on,it'll buckle,

444
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,130
你就能把那家伙彻底放倒
and you'll take the guy out of commission.

445
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,700
使用诡计 这就是你的伎俩?
Fighting dirty? That's your secret?

446
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,060
这世界上没什么光明正大的事
I didn't think there was any such thing as clean

447
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,700
尤其是在这
in a place like this.

448
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,230
阿历克斯 我很意外
You know,I'm surprised,Alex.

449
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,200
没想到你还会关心人
It almost sounds like you care.

450
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,300
你可是我离开这鬼地方的关键
You're my get-out-of-jail-free card.

451
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,700
要活着 
Just survive.

452
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,900
记得踹膝盖 要用尽力气
Kneecap,really hard.

453
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,600
祝你好运
Good luck,man.

454
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,360
上帝保佑你 
God bless,man.

455
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:15,360
两只狗之间有争执
We got a disagreement between two dogs 

456
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,800
一个是瘾君子 另一个是扒手
a drug addict and a thief.

457
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,360
两个我都不能饶恕
And I condone neither.

458
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,430
我已经金盘洗手了
And I wash my hands of both of them.

459
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,660
但是我们是有规矩的
But they have an issue,and we have rules.

460
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,000
没有规矩 我们就和野蛮没两样
And without rules,we're nothing but savages.

461
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,430
所以 我们要尊重规矩
Therefore,with proper respect for the rules,

462
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,460
这次的决斗只有一个规定
this fight is engaged with only one rule 

463
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,460
不能用武器
no weapons.

464
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,430
单挑
Only man versus man,

465
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,260
不能借助物品和障碍
without augmentation or handicap.

466
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,830
要说的都说完了
I'm done talking.

467
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,630
我不会打的 
I'm not going to fight 

468
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,060
你还没明白规矩 朋友
I don't think you understand the rules,friend.

469
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,960
只有活着的人才能走出去
Only one man comes out alive.

470
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,000
不能用武器 规矩不能坏 记得吗?
Rules are rules. Remember?

471
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,140
如果我们没规矩
