如果我从这里走出去

就是为那些希望我出去的人

121
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,740
听着 你别随便乱跑就行
Look, just stay put.

122
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,940
因为根本没人知道你在这儿
As long as no one knows you're here,

123
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,670
所以你应该很安全

124
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,140
我会回来的
I'll be back.
Why do they want me out of here so badly,

125
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,600
他们为什么迫切希望我出去

126
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
至少给我透露下吧
can you at least tell me that?

127
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,000
你用这招装无辜?
Is this the part where you pretend you're innocent?

128
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,770
整件事情都是走卒一个?
Just a pawn in all this?

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,800
如果他们之前和你说任何关于我的事
If they told you anything about me before you came here,

130
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,140
你应该明白是真的
you'd know that to be true.

131
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,640
我只不过是想知道他们到底想要什么
I just want to know what they want with me.

132
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,700
呆着 别离开
Stay put.

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,270
为了节省时间

我还是要强调下
I'm gonna have to insist

135
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,070
跳过那段我们都明白的
that we just skip right past all the threats I know

136
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,200
事先准备过的威胁论
you're prepared to layout.

137
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,400
要是莎拉和LJ有什么三长两短
Should anything happen to Sara to LJ,

138
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,870
你会追我到天涯海角
you will scour the Earth and hunt me down

139
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,370
抽我的筋 扒我的皮
and rip my heart from my chest

140
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,070
之类的 等等
and bup, bup, bup.

141
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,670
我绝对明白你的感受
I absolutely know how you feel,

142
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,570
就这些 行吗?
as would I, okay?

143
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
那就这么说好了
So that's done.

144
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
来谈正事
On to business.

145
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,740
你弟弟收到口信了吗?
Did you brother get the message?

146
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,900
很好 我们每天都会在这里碰头
Good. You and I will meet here every day.

147
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,800
我需要一份详细的越狱进展
I'll want a full report of the prior day's progress.

148
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,100
我打你手机 你就接听
When I call your cell phone, answer.

149
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,000

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
整体计划好
Get a plan together.

152
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,470
然后去执行
Execute it.

153
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,640
拿惠斯勒来换LJ和莎拉
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.

154
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,070
明白?
Are we clear?

155
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,400
我要儿子和莎拉的照片 证明他们没事
I want a picture of my son and Sara to prove they're alive.

156
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,040
没问题 我来搞定 还有呢
Fine. I can do that, next.

157
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,540
为什么选择我们?
Why us?

158
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,070
我会回答这个问题
I'll answer that question

159
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,900
这样你就能安心的做好你的工作
so we can put it to bed and you can focus on your work.

160
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,140
鉴于惠斯勒犯罪的性质
There's a political spotlight on Whistler

161
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,770
他在政界很受关注
due to the nature of his crime.

162
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,640
暴力解决 贿赂 随便什么招
Raids, bribes, what have you,

163
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,140

这么说吧 只能走歪门邪道
We have to go in through the back door, so to speak.

165
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,070
一星期不可能搞定
This can't be done in a week.

166
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,040
你就只有一周时间
You have a week. That's it.

167
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,200
明白?
Are we clear?

168
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,070
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

169

林肯 你说的没错
You're right, Lincoln.

173
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,600
家庭成员都会受到影响
Family trees being what they are,

174
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,700
母亲 父亲 兄弟姐妹
moms, da, brothers, sisters.

175
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,870
要是我儿子和莎拉有任何不测
Anything happens to my son or Sara,

176
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,840
我绝不会放过你 苏珊
I'm not coming after you, Susan.

177
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,040
快开工吧
Get to work.

178
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,470
成交
It's a deal

179
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,470
他的人抢走了水
His man knocks over the water 

180
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
难道你没见勒齐就这么逍遥地走了
Now, didn't you see how Lechero just walked away? 

181
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,140
他根本不关心我们
He doesn't care about us 

182
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,200
他根本屁都不管 
He doesn't give a damn 

183
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,470
高高在上 享受帝王般的生活
Living like a king up there 

184
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,270
出来啊 你怎么了 害怕了
Come out, what are you, afraid?

没有原因

知识分子 那你为何这么小声
Then why you whispering, college boy?

要不要给你个扩音器啊?
Why don't you lower your voice already?

194
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,670
-我能有什么好处? -抱歉

他为什么要躲起来?
Why's he hiding?

203
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,640
他要躲谁?
Who's he hiding from?

204
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,140
市长放话给勒齐说
Mayor get message to Lechero

205
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,400
如果惠斯勒死在索纳监狱

206

211
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,040
勒齐是这么说的

这是我和你之间的秘密

I never had her 

231
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,540

是我在玛丽克鲁兹逃跑之前
I ripped it off

238
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,840
从她身上扯下来的
Maricruz before she ran.

239

这里没有电话 所以我知道
There was no phone in that dump, so I knew you wouldn't

也许在摘葡萄
She's picking grapes.

246
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,040
我不知道
I have no idea.

247

I don't know, and maybe

263
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,040

it's better that way, huh?

264
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,770
我只需要
I just got

265
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,270
帮他越狱 对吗?
to get him out of here, right?

266
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,470
加油 兄弟 加油
Come on, man, come on.

267
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,640
我们要抓紧了
We got to keep moving, we got to keep moving.

268
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,800
下一步的行动是什么?
What's the next play?

269
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,470
惠斯勒昨天放了张纸条
Whistler got a note out

270
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,600
在尸体上面
on a dead body yesterday.

271
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,200
我不知道代表什么意思 或者要给谁
I don't know what it means or who it's for.

272
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,270
但是我们要争取主动
But we need all the leverage we can get,

273
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,340
而且 
and, uh 

274
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,100
我要点钱
I need some money.

275
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,000
以前从来没有人从这里成功越狱
No one's ever broken out of this place before,

276
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,440
更不用说用一个星期来计划了
let alone with a week to plan it,

277
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,070
所以 
so 

278
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,000
告诉那些带走了莎拉
you tell these people, whoever it is that took Sara

279
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,270
和我的外甥的人 
and my nephew 

280
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,300
告诉他们我知道了
you tell them I get it,

281
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,800
我会尽我所能
and I'm going to do everything I can.

282
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,670
我会帮那家伙越狱的
I'm going to break this guy out of here,

283
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,140
拼死去做
or I'm going to die trying.

284
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,140
要是真丢了这条命
And if it's the latter,

285
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,840
某种程度来说也是值得的 对吗?
then that should count for something, right?

286
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,940
会有意义的
Th's got to count for something.

287
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,570
就这么告诉他们
You tell them that.

288
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,000
我会的

289
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,570
告诉他们

你在这里很危险
You're not safe here.

294
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,470
我会带你到安全的地方
I can take you someplace that is.

295
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,640
如果你是来帮我的
If you're here to help me,

296
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,670
那别管我了
then just leave me alone.

Michael's locked up.

303
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,270
为什么?
For what?

304
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
我不知道 我正在理头绪
I don't know. I'm sorting it through.

305
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,440
我需要你的帮助
I could use your help.

306
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,940
我们 我们情况很糟糕

我刚和我的堂兄皮特打过电话

310
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,370
他告诉我她回芝加哥了
and he told me she's back over in Chicago.

311
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
你在芝加哥还被通缉 记得吗?

438
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,260
但这值得一听
But it's worth the breach in etiquette.

439
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,160
现在么

这么快就从索纳监狱出去

447
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,660
我为什么要抢了别人逃出去的机会呢
