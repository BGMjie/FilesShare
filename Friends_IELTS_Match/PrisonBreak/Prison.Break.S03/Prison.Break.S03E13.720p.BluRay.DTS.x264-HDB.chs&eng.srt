1
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,400
该死的 你搞什么鬼?
What the hell are you doing?

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,670
看好了 我手上有你需要的东西
You know I havewhat you need

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,960
到时候我会给你另一半的
And I'll give you the rest

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,310
前提是我确认索菲亚 lj
After I know that Sofia, lj 

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,730
他们都平安无事
They're all safe.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,090
我的书 书呢
My book my book 

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,270
起来
Get up 

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,080
这是哪里?
What is this place?

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,590
是我们交易的地方 按我们的约定
Where we're gonna make the exchange on our terms.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,010
沿路下去5英里的一个废弃仓库
An abandoned warehouse five miles down the road.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,310
20分钟内 带上我儿子到那儿
Be there in 20 minutes with my son.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,830
他们一定关闭了所有离开 巴拿马城的道路
They must've closed all the roads out of Panama.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,730
爸爸 那我们怎么办?
Papa, what do we do?

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,920
惠斯勒还在假装他的那套渔夫言论?
Whistler still pretending he's a fisherman and all this?

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,050
如果他不是渔夫 他又是干什么的呢?
Well, if he's not a fisherman, what is he?

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,350
我才不管他说什么
I don't care what he says 

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,660
我根本不认识什么叫迈克・斯科菲尔德的家伙
I don't know anything about this Michael Scofield guy 

18
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,590
你确认还要继续撒谎下去吗 费尔南多?
You sure you don't want to change your story Fernando?

19
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,430
我想这是我们分道扬镳的地方
I guess this is where I say good-bye.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,350
抢我的皮卡 
Hey my truck 

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,860
不 
No 

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,410
我们现在该怎么办?
What are we gonna do now?

23
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
能借用下手机吗?
Do you have a cell phone?

24
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,470
电话请借我
please

25
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,010
是我女儿 谢谢
It's my daughter thanks

26
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,580
我把他们甩了 赶紧过来接我
I lost them. you need to come and pick me up.

27
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,830
你在哪里?
Where are you?

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,880
让我猜猜电话那头是谁
Let me guess.

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,220
如果他有什么意外 
If anything happens to him 

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,790
那要看情况了 不是吗?
That depends, doesn't it?

31
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,770
我已经到了你说好的仓库了
I'm at the warehouse, like you said.

32
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,710
你们在哪里?
Where are you?

33
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,860
你想我们还能去哪 在追逐你的伙伴呢
Chasing your buddy where do you think I am?

34
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,150
好吧 何不返回这里
Well, why don't you get back here.

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,210
我手上有lj和索菲亚 我准备好做交易了
I have lj and Sofia. I'm ready to do the exchange.

36
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,360
-等我电话 -你说什么? 
Call you back. what? 

37
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,030
计划搞砸了
The pl's shot.

38
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,990
-她已经到了 -好吧 那现在呢?
She's already there. all right. so now what?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,260
我花了2周时间布置那仓库
It took me two weeks to hook up that warehouse.

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,690
我们总能想出对策的
We'll figure something out.

41
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,470
我能修复这一切 也是我正试图做的
I can fix this. that's what I was trying to do.

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,100
你打电话让他们来接你
You were calling them to pick you up.

43
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,060
这样就不会再有人受到伤害了
So no one else would get hurt 

44
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,090
你真以为我会让别人去冒险吗?
You really think I would put anyone's life at risk?

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,630
你早就这么做了
You already ve.

46
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,620
爸爸 我可不想回索纳监狱去
I-i can't goac b to Sona, papa 

47
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,950
我回不了头的 
I can't 

48
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,720
你不会回索纳监狱的
You're not going back to Sona.

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,210
问几个问题
A couple of questions

50
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,920
然后就可以走了
and you'll be on your way

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,450
我们正在寻找
We're looking for

52
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,610
四个从索纳监狱逃出来的逃犯
four escaped convicts from Sona.

53
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,930
你见过这些人中的哪一个吗

54
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,600
很抱歉 我不认识他们任何一个人
Sorry.I don't recognize any of them

55
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,780
你确定吗
You sure?

56
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,170
把车开到这边来
Pull over up there.

57
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,430
我们必须要检查你的车
We're going to have to inspect your car.

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,840
但是我以为你是说 
But I thought you said

现在把车开过来
Now pull over.

61
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,630
你想喝水吗?
Do you want some water?

62
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,330
还是打算告诉我迈克・斯科菲尔德哪去了?
Or do you want to tell me where Michael Scofield is?

63
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,210
我不知道他在哪里
I don't know where he is.

64
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,480
知道吗 打从你第一天来这里干活
You know, from the first day you started here,

65
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,360
我就知道这里面有什么猫腻
I knew there was something off about you.

66
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,670
或与我能第一眼就分辨出是否是囚犯
I guess I just know a con when I see one, huh?

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,460
或许你能成为当月之星优秀员工
Maybe you'll get to be employee of the month.

68
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,090
我在等着
I'm waiting.

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,850

我们在法兰西广场
We're at the Plaza De Francia.

73

你认为公众场合就来得更安全

有很多目击者来保护你们

在我看来 公众场合 通缉犯 警察

众人都可以来指认你

他是这里最糟忌恨的家伙
He's the most hated person in here.

83
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,720
如果我们继续和他手挽手 那我们就

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,820
他给了我容身之所 
He gave me a home 

85
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,530
他给我的是背部三级灼伤 
He gave me third-degree burns down my back 

86

我发誓 我真不知道怎么找到他

就不必担心有人要杀你了

失去目标
I've lost him.

136
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,710
这里不是交易地点
This is not the point

137
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,270
这只是确认下罢了

我想如果有人爬上我的卡车的话
I think I would have noticed if

someone had climbed on my track

还要我重复

00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,510
把那该死的油布揭开
Remove the damn tarp

154
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,340
不然我们就扣留你的车
or we'll impound your track

155
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,680
是肥料
It's fertilizer.

156
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,290
快走吧
Just get out of here.

157
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,560
走
Go.

158
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,620
谢谢 爸爸
Gracias, papa.

159
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
还有一站
One more stop.

160
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,680
下面开始暴动了
There's a storm brewing out there in the yard.

161
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,950
去告诉他们 
You tell them 

162
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,490
尽管来 我不怕他们
Come in. I'm not scared.

163
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,800
我怕
Well, I am.

164
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,210
那东西 还是放下吧
You might want to put that down.

165
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,280
蒂博格
Oh, Teodoro.

166
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,220
真没想到帮我的人会是你
You're the last one I'd expect to see at my side.

167
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,370
我始终站强大这方 老大
I take offense, patron.

168
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,380
我有过很多提鞋的人
I've had many foot-washers.

169
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,080
很多都披着伪善的外衣
Many men have come in with sheep's clothing,

170
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,040
到后来就全部暴露本性了
Only to let the wolf come out.

171
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,050
我不想害你 只是想要帮你
I am not trying to hurt you. I am trying to save you.

172
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,360
帮我?
Save me?

173
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,170
我会死在这
I'm gonna die here.

174
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,650
和我待这儿 就是死路一条
Your life is in jeopardy just being with me.

175
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,100
未必
Not necessarily.

176
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,060
当我刚才被押回来的时候
As I was being escorted back inside today, one of the guards

177
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,400
有一个警卫说 我们有机会买回自由
Offered us a chance to buy our freedom.

178
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,980
如果警卫跟你说 那他就是在骗你
If a guard spoke to you, he was lying.

179
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,760
出去根本不可能
It's impossible to get out.

180
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,640
也许你还没注意到就被警卫毙了
Maybe you've been too busy dying to notice,

181
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,540
但是外面来了个新军官
But there's a new colonel outside those gates.

182
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,730
小小的索纳监狱现在看管
Little suzy Sona ain't playing so hard

183
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,690
没那么严了 有钱就行
To get no more. she has her price.

184
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,710
我们需要一笔钱
And we gonna need some money.

185
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,050
没有
No.

186
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,050
没有
No.

187
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,430
那么你就死在这吧
Then you will die in here.

188
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,050
迈克
Michael.

189
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,490
古代博物馆的大厅
The lobby of the museum of antiquities.

190
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,340
为什么
Why?

191
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,780
因为惠斯勒在那
Because that's where Whistler is.

192
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,280
你太精明了
You're overthinking things.

193
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,070
我以前见识过太多了
I've seen it too many times before.

194
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,910
第一个计划失败 你就开始虚张声势了
The first plan goes to hell and then you start tap-dancing,

195
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,470
相信我 计划终归会流产
And, trust me, it always ends badly.

196
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,280
你有5分钟
You have five minutes.

197
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,320
真不可思议
Unbelievable.

198
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,960
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

199
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,240
有什么高兴的
What's so funny?

200
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,210
你呀
You.

201
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,090
以为你比我叔叔更聪明?
Thinking you can outsmart my uncle.

202
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,340
走
Walk.

203
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,610
金属探测器
Metal detectors.

204
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,090
我想在这里我们会建立起一种信任
And here I thought we were building a circle of trust.

205
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,730
过来一楼的西南角
Come to the southwest corner of the first floor.

206
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,080
好
Fine.

207
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,820
这样就够了
But that's it.

208
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,930
不要再玩花样了
No more stops on your guided tour.

209
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,370
如果我没有带着惠斯勒走出这个地方
If I don't walk out of here with Whistler,

210
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,550
我就抹了lj的脖子
I'm gonna snap lj's neck.

211
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,200
当然 我说到做到
And yes, I can do it.

212
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,430
我们行动吧
Here we go.

213
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,840
每个人都准备好了吗
Is everyone in position?

214
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,180
收到
Roger that.

215
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,210
最后一瓶朗姆酒
Last bottle of rum.

216
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,920
再见了 老大
Good-bye, patron.

217
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,990
他们要多少钱
How much do they want?

218
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,910
5万
$50,000.

219
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
不可能
No.

220
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,690
我们可不是在提华纳为了一块地毯讨价还价
We're not in tijuana haggling over a ket.

221
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,400
我们是为了你的命
We're talking about your life.

222
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,810
即使我可以 弄到那笔钱
Even if I could find the money,

223
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,380
我能让谁给带进来
Who could I trust to bring it in?

224
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,610
就有那么一个人
There is one person.

225
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,680
你怎么认识詹姆斯的
How do you know James?

226
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,880
你在挑战我最后的防线吗 快走
You're working my last nerve. move your ass.

227
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,870
放松点
Relax.

228
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,470
每个人都给我冷静点 我们都会走出去的
Everybody stays cool and we will all walk out of here.

229
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,530
我们一得到lj 你就得到惠斯勒
As soon as we get lj, you get Whistler.

230
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,490
lj先到我们这边来
But lj ces to us first.

231
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,780
去吧

感谢上帝 你还好好的
Thank god, you're safe.

234
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,420
坐标呢
What about the coordinates?

235
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,060
你说过的 你见到惠斯勒以后
You said first thing you would do once

236
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,810
就只要剩余的坐标
You had whistler was to get the rest of the coordinates.

237
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,230
她不是开玩笑吧?
Is she serious?

238
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,040
我们走出这里的时候
I'll give her exactly whathe wants

239
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,610
我会给她她想要的
When we get out of here.

240
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,460
但是亲爱的 这里不安全 我们得走了
But darling, it's not safe. we need to go.

241
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,120
我要看看他们
I want to see them.

242
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,140
索菲亚 快走吧

243
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,980
我们离开这里
Let's get outta here.

等下 等下 等下
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

245
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,710
索菲亚
Sofia.

246
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,630
你把那些数字写在一张纸上了
You otwrthose numbers on a piece of paper.

247
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,010
在索纳我给了她一半
I gave her half at sona.

248
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,690
我答应现在要给她另一半的
I promised to give her the other half now.

249
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,230
我知道我说过的话 等会儿再谈这个好吧
I know what I said, and we'll discuss it later.

250
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,280
真相大白了是吧
Come on. welcome to the real world.

251
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,730
我早厌烦了
I'm sick of jumping through hoops

252
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,850
整天把你的公主当宝贝似的照顾
To keep your princess in a bubble.

253
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,590
-是时候该走了 -这是我俩之间的事
It is time to go. this is between us.

254
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,140
坐标在哪里 苏珊?
Where are the coordinates, Susan?

255
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,370
没有坐标这回事好了吧
There are no coordinates.

256
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,530
索菲亚
Sofia.

257
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,790
赶紧
Come on.

258
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,520
索菲亚
Sofia.

259
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,640
索菲亚
Sofia.

260
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,620
詹姆斯
James.

261
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,720
别闹了
Stop kidding yourself.

262
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,190
该走了
It's time to leave.

263
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,130
你还留在这里干什么
And what the hell are you still doing here?

264
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,790
如果我是你的话 武器带不进来
If I were you and I couldn't bring weapons inside,

265
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,650
我肯定会叫几个特工守在门口
I'd have agents at every exit

266
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,230
等我们一出去就开枪
Ready to shoot as soon as we stepped outside.

267
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,590
所以你从哪个门出去都无所谓
Well, then it really doesn't matter

268
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,110
是吧
What exit you take, does it?

269
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,560
我从那个门走哦
I'm gonna go out that door.

270
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,050
也许你们该从那个门走
Maybe you should take that door.

271
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,670
事实上
Actually,

272
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,290
紧急情况下那个门会被锁上
That door is locked in the event of an emergency.

273
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,600
什么紧急情况
What emergency?

274
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,000
这个
This one.

275
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,100
我们走出去 一起
We're all walking out of here.

276
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,520
很戏剧化哦 自己把警察找过来
That's very dramatic, calling the cops on yourself.

277
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,640
看来你真的很想回索纳哦
You must really want to go back to Sona.

278
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,300
他们不是来抓逃犯的 格雷琴
They're not looking for a con, Gretchen,

279
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,220
他们是来抓小偷的
They're looking for a thief.

280
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,030
我跟你说过的一切都是为了保护你
Whatever I told you, it was always to protect you.

281
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,820
让我解释吧 你肯定会理解我的
You'll understand, if you just let me explain.

282
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,680
躺下
Lie down

283
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,040
你们这么做 就因为我认得迈克・斯科菲尔德
All this because I knew Michael Scofield?

284
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,220
告诉我他在哪
Tell me where he is.

285
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,990
我不知道
I don't know 

286
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,890
马上躺下 
Lie down now 

287
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,970
就算我知道 
Even if I knew 

288
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,030
喂
Yes?

289
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,020
好的
All right.

290
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,030
马上到
It'll be here shortly.

291
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,340
拿到钱之后
Now that we have the money,

292
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,950
怎么送到狱警手里
How do we get it to the guard?

293
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,490
不送给狱警
We don't.

294
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,480
什么意思 不送? 我们说好 
What do you mean, we don't? we-we-we were supposed

295
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,620
买通狱警的啊 这是计划啊 
To bribe the guard that was the plan 

296
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,230
这才是计划
This is the plan.

297
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,410
这是正经事
This is business.

298
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,370
你们所有人 都会理解我
And you, of all people, should understand.

299
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,860
帮我把他按住
Help me hold him down.

300
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,320
你在说什么?
What the hell you talking about?

301
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,560
快点
Do it.

302
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,240
快点 
Do it 

303
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,580
蒂博格 
Teodoro 

304
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,420
蒂博格 蒂博格 
Teodoro Teodoro 

305
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,770
反正我死是早晚的事
It's just a matter of time, anyway.

306
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,200
但是死在这两个小偷手里 
But from one thief to another 

307
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,060
给我点尊严吧
 out of respect,

308
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,330
痛快点
Make it quick.

309
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,970
只要你不反抗
If you don't fight me,

310
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,820
我就会让你痛快点的
I will.

311
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,760
走好 朋友
Adios, homey.

312
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,020
这里有问题
Over here.

313
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,240
怎么了

00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,970
这是塑料的
It's plastic.

320
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,080
现在我们能走了吗
Now, if you'll excuse us.

330
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,530
就会被抓 这对我们都没好处
You'll get arrested, and that won't do any of us any good.

331
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,660
凭你对她的所作所为我就该杀了你 
I ought to kill you right now for what you've done to her 

332
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,940

我这样做都是为了把你救出来 明白吗 
I did what I had to do to get you out, period 

334
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,020
别忘了什么才是生死攸关 詹姆斯
You remember what's at stake, James.

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,970
停车 我不能丢下她
Stop the van. I can't leave her.

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,690
她已经抛弃你了

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,480
我不会扔下她
I'm not gonna leave her

你都准备好了吧?
Do you have everything?

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,780
我的书不见了
The book is gone.

347
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,770
什么叫不见了?
What do you mean, gone?

348
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,730
是真的吗?
Is it true?

349
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,270
勒齐 
Lechero 

350
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,970

He's 

351
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,690
他真的 
He's really 

352
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,430
还好

353
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,650
我怎么给你这些?
How do you want me to give you this?

354
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,090
那些警卫
The guards, they won't

355
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,930
-不会再让我进去了 -我只想得到
Let me in anymore. I only want

356
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,460
我需要的东西
What I asked for.

357
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,090
先等几天
Hold on to the rest for a few days.

358
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,600
如果你想
If you were to consider leaving

359
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,450
携款逃跑 那 
With all that, well 

360
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,670
我会非常生气的
I just want you to know I'd be very cross with you.

361
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,410
众所周知
I've been known to have

362
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,510
如果有人背叛我 
A bit of a temper problem 

363
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,190
我会大发雷霆的
When betrayed.

364

不会的
No.

365
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,860
说定了
A deal's a deal.

366
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,800
你为我做了那么多
You've done so much for me.

367
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,850
我向你保证
You have my word.

368
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,460
等等
Wait.

369
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,680
不 不
No, no.

370
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,980
没关系
It's okay.

371
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,540
我会等着你
I'll wait for you.

372
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,070
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

373
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,080
迈克・斯科菲尔德在哪里?
Where is Michael Scofield?

374
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,400
迈克・斯科菲尔德在哪里?
Where is Michael Scofield?

375
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,360
好了

376
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,310
这不管用
This is not working.

377
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,850
过几分钟他就..
A few minutes more

你就问清楚他们在哪里
You're gonna find out where they are,

383
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,890
不然我会自己接
Or I'm gonna answer it myself,

384
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,570
让他们听见你中枪而死的惨叫声
So they can hear you scream when I blow your head off.

385
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,920
喂?

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,740
是的

392
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,300
你在哪里?
Where are you?

393
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,540
你们救出LJ了吗?

396
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,840
他好吗?
Is he okay?

397
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,150
他没事
He's fine.

398
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,550
你真的没事?
Are you sure you're all right?

399
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,490
我还好
I'm fine.

400
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,100
一切都顺利
It all worked out.

401
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,030
我要去坐公车了 伙计 保重
I'm about to catch the bus, papi. take care.

402
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,320
好啊

403
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,230
杀了我吧
Kill me if you want.

404
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,230
你错了 伙计
Wrong, papi.

405
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,010
我会让你求生不得 求死不能
You're gonna wish we had.

406
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,450
勒齐已经死了 
Lechero is dead 

407
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,320
勒齐已经死了 
Lechero is dead 

408
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,970
我在此将他埋葬 
I come before you now to bury the man 

409
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,860
 并不是要赞扬他什么
 not to praise him,

410
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,330
因为他在这里残酷的统治
For there is nothing praiseworthy

411
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,000
根本就没有值得赞扬之处
About his rule here.

412
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:17,040
让我们其中的一员发号施令?
Having one of our own dictate to us?

413
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,520
那可不符合自然规律
Well, that's just not the natural order.

414
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,330
在这里都是平等的 
All cons are equal 

415
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,570
我这里还剩余一些 
I have the last remnants 

416
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,160
勒齐剥削来的财富
Of Lechero's cruel empire in my hand.

417
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,040
我曾渴望加入他们之中
An empire which I willingly participated in

418
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,570
也曾目睹他们的恶行
And witnessed first-hand.

419
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,850
这些钱 都是压榨你们而来
Money made off of your backs

420
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,790
全是出自你们的辛劳 
And off the backs of your family 

421
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,240
现在这些是你们的了
It's yours.

422
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,890
我要说的是
And I'm here to tell you,

423
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,440
我要将它们物归原主
I'm giving it back.

424
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,060

我们都是平等的
We're all equal.

429
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,940
我们都是平等的
We're all equal.

430
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,470
-她会没事的 -太好了
She's gonna be okay. good.

431
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,650
迈克叔叔 
Uncle Mike, um 

432
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,790
我一直想等到我们安全以后再给你
I wanted to wait until we were safe to do this,

433
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,970
可是 
But 

434
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:40,760
在莎拉和我被囚禁的屋子里我找到了这个
I found this in the room where Sara and I were he

435
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,720
我想也许你需要它
I thought you might want to have it.

436
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,660
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

437
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,680
谢谢
Thanks.

438
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,640
索菲亚怎么样了?
How's Sofia doing?

439
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,130
-她很好 -好的
She's good. good.

440
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,730
警察很快会离开
The cops will be leaving soon.

441
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,040
然后你就能上去看看她了
You can go up and see her, then.

442
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,330
太好了
Good.

443
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,930
她想让我告诉你
She wanted me to tell you something.

444
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,440
在她公寓的
She said there's something

445
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,430
床底
In her apartment underneath her bed.

446
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,010
-有一些关于惠斯勒的情报 -我不感兴趣
Something about Whistler. I'm not interested.

447
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,280
是什么?
What is it?

448
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,560
迈克 已经结束了
Michael, this is over.

449
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,890
到此为止了
It's done.

450
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,550
我问 那是什么?
I said,"what is it?"

451
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,020
你迟到了
You're late.

452
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,430
我的饮料你付钱
And you owe him for my drinks.

453
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,440
能让我们单独呆会儿吗
Give us a minute?

454
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,620
出手挺大方
It's a nice tip.

455
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,070
她付了我钱
She handles the money.

456
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,520
加入吗
You in?

457
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,080
若她能付比那更多的钱
She'd better be able to handle a lot more than that.

458
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,150
因为如果她真如你所想
Because if she has done

459
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,900
那样做了 那么莎拉 
What you think she has Sara 

460
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,600
 她才是突破点
 she's the weak link.

461
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,600
斯科菲尔德会找到她
And he will find her.

462
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,750
接着他会发现你 
And then scofield will find you 

463
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,320
 和我
 and me.

464
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,070
那时我不会为你所做的一切负责
And I'm not paying for your mess.

465
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,210
加入与否?
Are you in or are you out?

466
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,100
我加入
I'm in.

467
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,830
林肯?
Linc?

468
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,690
没事
Yeah.

469
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,070
把枪给我
I need your gun.

470
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,200
谢谢
Thanks.

471
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,070
杰森 利夫
"jason lief."

472
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,010
你听说过这家伙?
You heard of this guy?

473
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,630
没有 但如果他对惠斯勒很重要的话
No, but if he's important to Whistler,

474
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,100
那对我也很重要
