告诉你那渔夫 书在斯科菲尔德的哥哥手上

00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,790
放过惠斯勒吧
Just take the bounty off Whistler.

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,390
惠斯勒对我而言没有利用价值
Whistler don't mean nothing to me, man.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
我可以帮上很多忙
There are ways I can be of assistance.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,700
惠斯勒现在清白了吧
Whistler's clear?

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
和天空一样清白 兄弟
Clear as the blue sky, brother.

那么我们怎么出去
So, how are we getting out of here?

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,900
我也不知道
I have no idea.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,900
你在这干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,300
我只是 
I just 

11
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,700
我需要点钱 还有我 
I need some money, and I didn't 

12
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
我也不知道可以去哪里
I didn't know where else to go.

13

我有大概$50
I've got about $50.

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,300
不
Nono.

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400
老兄 我指的是那几百万
I'm talking about the millions, papi.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,100
背包呢?
The backpack?

17
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,990
所有的钱都在里面
There's all sorts of cash in that thing.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,800
需要个地方躲下 我帮你 但是背包没了
Need a place to crash,I got your back,but the backpack's gone.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,700
我的那份是给我弟弟的
Any money I dig out is for my brother.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
记得他吗
Remember him?

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,900
高高的个子 有点瘦
Tall guy, kind of thin.

22
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,600
帮你越狱
Busted your ass out of jail.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
我觉得欠他的情
I feel bad about Mike.

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,100
真的 林肯
I do, Linc.

25
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,300
不是所有人都可以被赦免的
But not all of us got exonerated, you know.

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,390
非常清楚
Pretty clear on that.

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,590
我现在甚至都不能回家
I can't ever go home again.

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,190
你有麻烦吗 苏克雷?
You got problems, Sucre?

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,300
林肯 不是只有你有麻烦
You ain't the only one,Linc.

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,400
对
That's right.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,300
我们某种程度上都有罪
We're all guilty of something, man.

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,500
我们所有人
All of us.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,300
但他们不是
Not them.

34
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
我需要帮助
I want to help.

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,400
但是看起来只是越陷越深
But it seems like it's only getting deeper and deeper.

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,100
我只是想要些钱 然后重新开始
Look, I just, I just want money to get back on my feet and that's it, Linc.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
林肯
Linc?

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,200
算了
Never mind.

39
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,900
人性泯灭到兽性大发 用不了多久
Doesn't take too long for a man to become animal, no?

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,900
聪明人会先去占他的床位
The smart ones go for his bunk first.

41
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,700
那笨人会干嘛?
What do the dumb ones do?

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,990
嘿 我先来的
Hey, I was here first.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,190
贱人 你来这才两天而已
Mampi bitch, you been here two days.

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,990
我是说 我第一个拿到他的鞋的
I meant I was the first one to the shoe,

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,190
你个装大胸的家伙 拿过来
you sack-in-the-box now hand it over.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,890
你是不是要个鸡爪来决斗
You're asking for a chicken foot, friend.

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,200
想要鞋是吗
You want this shoe?

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
那就放马过来吧
You're gonna have to come and get it.

49
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,200
让他过来
Leave him. Leave him.

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
我只是想表达我的谢意
I just wanted to express my thanks

51
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
为 
for, uh 

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
为惠斯勒的事
for Whistler.

53
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,700
我不知道你在说什么
I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.

54
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
对不起我的错
My mistake.

55
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,600
另外 或许我们能重新做些安排
Anyway, I thought maybe we could make some kind of arrangement.

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
也许我能
Maybe I could

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,300
在这帮上什么忙
help out around Sona.

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,300
过来哥们
Come here, boy.

59
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
你们过去

00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
你来帮我?
You help me?

61
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,490
我是这的老大
I'm the bucky massa here, boy.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,400
是我 不是你
Me. Not you.

63
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,300
任何人想在索纳监狱要东西 只能来找我
So if anyone want anything at Sona, it's me them will come to.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,390
所以不要到这来 说什么能帮忙
So do not walk in here asking for some favor

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,700
好像我们有什么共识似的 不 没有
like we have some understanding. No, no, no, no, no.

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
根本没有
We do not.

67
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,200
小子 下次你再来这一套
The next time you roll in here like that, boy,

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,400
你只能乞求我能仁慈点
the only thing you ask me for is mercy.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,500
明白了吗
Si?

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,100
斯科菲尔德 有访客
Scofield, visitor.

71
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,600
去吧 小子
Go on, boy.

72
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,100
现在 去吧 你妈妈在找你呢
Now, run along, your momma calling ya.

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
不妙 对吧
That bad, huh?

74
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,300
很不妙
It's not good.

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,400
你呢
You?

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
我追查你从惠斯勒那得到信息
I followed that message you got from Whiler.

77
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,090
全是关于一本书的
It's all about some book.

78
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,890
鸟类导读 上面有名字和号码
A bird guide. Names and numbers on it.

79
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,290
有关于他身份的线索吗
Any clues as about who he might be?

80
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,500
还没 我们不是唯一在追查他的人
No. We weren't the only ones following his directions.

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,400
他女友也在列 称他是个渔夫
His girl was there, says he's some kind of fisherman.

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
对 最好他是
Yeah, sure he is.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,500
听着 伙计 我 我想给你看些东西
Listen, man, I, uh, I want you to check something out.

84
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,700
我的天啊
Oh, my God 

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,090
她举着报纸的姿势
The way she's holding the paper

86
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,190
就好像她在 
it's like she's, uh,

87
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,290
好像她在指着什么
it's like she's pointing at something.

88
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,200
太小了 我看不清
It's too small I can't read it.

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,390
是今天的报纸
This is today's paper.

90
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,490
她指着圣丽塔
She's pointing at Santa Rita.

91
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,900
那是离这20英里远的小镇
It's a small town 20 miles from here.

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,100
她在试着告诉我们她在哪
She's trying to tell us where she is.

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,390
我得跟她说话 林肯
I have to talk to her, Linc.

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,790
就算他们让你跟她通话 伙计
Even if they let you talk to her, man,

95
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,990
他们也会监听你的每字每句
they'll be listening to every word you say.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,690
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

97
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,600
除了地名 我们还需要更多信息
We're gonna need more than the name of that town.

98
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,500
我至今还是什么办法都没有 林肯
I'm coming up empty-handed here, Linc.

99
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,300
已经3天了 
It's already been three days and 

100
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,800
而我一筹莫展
I got nothing to show for it.

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,400
所以 如果我不能把惠斯勒从这救出去
So, if I can't break Whistler out of here 

102
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,900
你必须得把他们从那救出来
you're gonna have to break them out of there.

103
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
那么 计划是什么 伙伴?
So, what's the deal, mate?

104
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
什么时候行动
When's moving day?

105
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,100
你告诉我你是谁 我就告诉你计划
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.

106
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,690
-我是个渔夫 -是吗
-I'm a fisherman. -Really?

107
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,900
我也是
So am I.

108
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
你还在担心我是否值得信赖?
You're worried about trusting me?

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,990
我的命掌握在你的手里
My life is in your hands.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,900
我怎么知道我是不是该信任你
How am I supposed to know that I can trust you?

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,100
你不要知道
You don't.

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,600
斯图尔特・斯科特
Hey. Stuart Scott.

113
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,990
一号 对吧? 你看体育中心吗?
Number one, right? You watch the SportsCenter?

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,300
最近没有 听着 我需要打个电话
Not recently. Look, I need to get my hands on a phone.

115
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
我还想要摸女人呢
I need to get my hands on some pechos.

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
但是那是不可能实现的 对吧
But that ain't gonna happen either, is it?

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
再说 谁那么重要 你必须得打给她
Who you got to call so important anyway?

118
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,900
莎拉
Sara

119
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,400
绝对不可能
Absolutely not.

120
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,090
这不是个请求 而是命令
It ain't a request; it's a dictation of terms.

121
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,200
我弟弟不会想办法越狱 除非他跟莎拉通话
My brother ain't thinking about escape till he talks to Sara.

122
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,700
真甜蜜
Aw, that's sweet.

123
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,400
我可以向你保证2件事 林肯
I can assure you of two things, Lincoln.

124
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,090
第一 莎拉没事
One, that Sara's fine

125
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,900
第二 你可以把我打翻在场
and two, you have a better chance of banging me on that bar

126
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,400
但绝不能和她通话
than you do of talking to her.

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
感谢你的提议 但是我拒绝
I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass.

128
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,390
-确定? -确定
Yeah? Yeah.

129
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,600
但如果这是个命令呢
Oh, what if that's a dictation of terms.

130
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,390
这根本没有协商的余地
It's not a matter of negotiaon.

131
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000
政府把这里的电话拆了精光
Government rip out all the phones

132
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,000
当发现这帮罪人在索纳监狱依然恶性不改
when they find out bad men in Sona still setting up deals.

133
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,000
还像过去那样闹个不停
Making bang-bangs just like before.

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
他们就把电话线切断了
They just did it over the phone.

135
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,500
如果是切断线路的话 或许能修复
Well, if they cut the lines, maybe we can fix 'em.

136
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,200
大哥 没什么好修的
There's nothing to fix, bro.

137
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
这里以前沿着墙根都是成卷的电话线
There used to be a whole row of them all along the wall,

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,700
但是现在都没有了
but they're gone now.

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,090
如果你没有问题了
If you have no more questions

140
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,190
我就走了
I'm just gonna get going.

141
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,000
迈克两天内就救下了惠斯勒的命
Michael got the bounty off Whistler's head in two days.

142
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,300
那是你们的人两周都办不到的
That's more than your people could do in two weeks.

143
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
来点诚意吧
Show some goodwill.

144
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,000
当他救出惠斯勒后 会得到的
He'll get his goodwill when Whistler's out.

145
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,100
这点你必须了解下我弟弟
One thing you should know about my brother,

146
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,700
那就是他很顽固
he's very stubborn.

147
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,400
要想有收获 必须先付出
You want him to fetch, you throw him a bone.

148
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,990
那么让迈克在狱内通个电话怎样?
How does Michael think he's gonna get his hands on a phone inside Sona?

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
那手机呢?
What about cell phones?

150
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,590
这边人来人往的 可以带个混进来
With all the traffic moving in and out of here.

151
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,100
手机想都别想
Cell phone big no-no.

152
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,890
只有一个人有权有手机
Only one man has access to it,

153
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,100
而他绝不会给你这样的家伙用
and he would never let a zanahoria like you 

154
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,000
让我猜猜是谁
Let me guess.

155
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,700
这是什么?
What is it?

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,890
外头给你的本周行动指示
The weekly from your operations on the outside.

157
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,400
低调行事
Grave digger dropped it off.

158
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,000
这可办不到
That couldn't be.

159
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
这薄薄的信封就打发我了
This envelope way too thin.

160
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,800
东西运输上最近有点慢
Stuff just moving a little slow on the outside these days.

161
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,500
是吗 东西运得慢
Oh, stuff moving slow.

162
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,900
是故意有人磨时间吧
Somebody making it move slower.

163
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,500
蒂博格
Teodoro.

164
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,100
去楼下的理发师那边给我准备下
Set up something at the barber downstairs for me now.

165
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,400
遵命 老大 没有问题
Yes, sir. No problem at all.

166
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,000
告诉那贱货
You tell that bitch

167
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,200
要是再用剃刀割到我 就要她好看
she nick me with the razor again, I'm gonna use it 'pon her.

168
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
你还活着
You're still alive.

169
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,200
你依然可爱动人
And you're still lovely.

170
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
拜托 我都三天没洗澡了
Oh, please, I haven't showered in three days.

171
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,100
不管你身上什么味 都是成熟味
Whatever you smell like, it's a significant upgrade.

172
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,490
当我和你失去联系后 我 
When I didn't hear from you, I 

173
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,600
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,800
-我提醒过你这会有些 -我知道 只是
I warned you it might be a bit I know, I know. It's just 

175
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,890
每次他们拖出尸身来 
every time they dragged out a body 

176
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,800
看着我
Look at me.

177
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,600
我向你保证 离开这后生活绝不会这样的
I promise you when I leave this place, it won't be like that.

178
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,600
好吧
Okay.

179
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,390
你找到我的书了吗?
Now, were you able to find my book?

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,300
是的
Yeah.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,790
但是有个家伙
But there was this guy.

182
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
他跟踪了我
He followed me.

183
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,200
怎么样的人?
What guy?

184
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,600
我也不认识
I don't know.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
他有没有伤到你?
Did he hurt you?

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,500
没有
No,

187
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,800
但是他把书夺走了
but he took it.

188
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,690
对不起 辜负你了
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,690
我不知道该怎么办好
I didn't know what to do.

190
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,400
他长什么样?
-What did he look like? -Um 

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,100
光头 块头很大
shaved head,kind of big.

192
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,600
他让我告诉你 书在斯科菲尔德的哥哥手上
He said to tell you that Scofield's brother has it now.

193
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
-斯科菲尔德是谁? -好吧
Who's Scofield? Okay.

194
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,490
斯科菲尔德是谁?
Who's Scofield? Hmm?

195
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
没什么特别的
No one.

196
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,490
他就是 和我一起工作的家伙
He's just, um he's someone I'm working with.

197
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
他会帮我离开这里
He's gonna help me get out of here.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
他是律师吗?
He's a lawyer?

199
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,800
基本上是吧
Basically.

200
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,990
这就是为何你让他拿到书
That's why you want him to have the book.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,190
听着索菲亚 你知道的越少就越安全
Look, Sofia, the less you know about this, the safer you'll be.

202
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,990
我知道的越少就越帮不了你
The less I know, the less help I'll be.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,100
说的没错
Exactly.

204
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,690
我就想你回避一段时间行吗 宝贝?
I just need you to lay low for a while. Okay, sweetheart?

205
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,400
詹姆斯 这到底怎么回事?
What the hell is going on, James?

206
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,490
这书到底有什么玄机?
What is so important about this book?

207
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,300
没有
Nothing.

208
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,200
不过是有些笔记罢了
It just has notes in it,

209
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,390
比如电话号码之类的
you know, phone numbers.

210
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,100
也就是朋友的朋友 想法把我弄出去
It's people who know people who are going to help me get out of here.

211
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
你在撒谎
You're lying.

212
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,100
我为何要对你撒谎?
Why would I lie to you?

213
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,800
你是我唯一能信任的人
You're the only person in the world that I can trust.

214
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,300
过来点
Come here.

215
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
过来点
Come here.

216
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,800
现在我只要你信任我
Now, I just need you to trust me.

217
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,800
然后呢?
And do what?

218
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,800
没有然后
Nothing.

219
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,800
请在这签下字
Sign out, please

220
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
臭小子 你在找东西?
You looking for something, blanquito?

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,190
是的 我在找
Yeah, yeah, I am, I am.

222
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
你在找什么东西?
What you looking for then?

223
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,800
就想找些 能消磨时间的东西
Just a little, uh little something to pass the time.

224
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
你有钱吗?
You got paper?

225
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,700
下楼去失物招领处找找
Go down to the lost and found with the rest of them.

226
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,200
他们会让你满意的
They'll hook you up proper.

227
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,100
行
All right.

228
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,690
我发现你在别人的地盘找东西
I find you sniffing around where you don't belong,

229
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,500
再这样 你就会和我去决斗
you'll find yourself in that ring again against me.

230
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,500
你根本没有胜机
I don't like your odds.

231
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,700
我给你看看这个
I want you to check something out, all right?

232
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,600
看她的左手 好像在指着什么东西
Look at her left hand like she's pointing at something.

233
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,900
你最好和我表弟说 让他准备好
Well, you'd better tell my cousin he'd better make himself available.

234
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,200
他缺钱总比让我失去耐心要好
Better him short money than me short patience.

235
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
听明白了?
No comprende, boy?

236
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,600
手机要去充电
I need a charge.

237
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,790
蒂博格
Teodoro,

238
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,790
快去 给我准备好换洗衣服
go on, get me laundry, no?

239
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,590
没问题 差点忘了 我和理发师说过了
Sure thing, boss oh, almost forgot. Uh, I talked to the barber.

240
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
她下午两点能为您服务
She's gonna squeeze you in today around 2:00.

241
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,400
老大 如果这能让你开心起来的话
If that pleases you, patrón.

242
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,900
不错
Patrón.

243
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,690
我觉得你该做出正确选择赎罪了
I think it's time you made good on all the bad you've done, Theodore.

244
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,500
我们之间做个交易
You and me, we're going to make a deal.

245
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
勒齐有个手机
Lechero has a cell phone.

246
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
我需要那手机
I need it.

247
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,890
没有问题
No problem.

248
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,000
需要我在内部帮你做手脚?
Shall I turn water into wine while I'm at it?

249
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,590
还是把那家伙的老妈给睡了?
Maybe give the guy's mother a good rodgering?

250
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,590
她可能太老了 不对你胃口
She'd be a little old for your tastes, no?

251
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,700
小心点
Careful, Pretty.

252
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,290
别自己惹祸上身
Don't bite the hand you trying to get fed out of.

253
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,890
我没有在找麻烦 我是在找寻帮助
I'm not looking for food, I'm looking for a favor.

254
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,990
我干吗要帮你?
Why the hell should I do you a favor, huh?

255
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,690
因为我不像他们 非常了解你的为人
Cause unlike your new compadres, I know who you are,

256
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,100
知道你都干了什么 对谁干的
what you've done and who you've done it to.

257
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,590
不如挑明直说了吧
Let me get this straight.

258
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,800
你是说你想要告发我?
You're saying you gonna tell on me?

259
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,300
我要说的是 这是个信教的国家
this here is a religious country,

260
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,290
我宁可赌一把 看看巴拿马良民
and I'm willing to bet the good folks down in Panama

261
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,800
会如何善待强奸犯
don't take too kindly to rapists

262
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,100
兼恋童癖的
and pedophiles.

263
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
你愿意和我赌上一把吗?
You want to bet against me?

264
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,990
兄弟 听着
Listen, mate.

265
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,800
这是我目前知道的情况
Here's what I know so far.

266
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,090
我知道你的兄弟在外面想办法把我们弄出去
I know you've got a brother helping on the outside,

267
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,590
我还知道他跑去见我女朋友了
I know he ran into my girlfriend,

268
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
还从她那里拿走了我的一本书
and I know he took a book from her that belongs to me.

269
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,900
把书还给我
I'd like it back.

270
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,000
那本书有那么特别吗
What's so special about this book?

271
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,690
除非能想办法出去
Well, unless it has directions out of this prison,

272
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,800
我认为你不会真的在乎这本书
I don't think it should really matter to you.

273
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,100
你根本不知道我在乎什么
You don't know what matters to me.

274
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
我们出去了就把书还给你
You can get that book back when we get out of Sona.

275
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,800
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

276
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,190
那究竟啥时候我们能出去呢
And when the hell is that exactly?

277
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,100
到现在为止 我根本看不出能逃出生天
Because so far I haven'seen bollocks in the way of breaking out of here.

278
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,500
我来告诉你目前掌握的情况
Let me tell you what I know so far.

279
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,490
有帮干尽坏事的家伙
Some very bad people who have done

280
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,500
希望你活着
some very bad things want you alive

281
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,790
并且从这里出去 我的良知告诉我
and out of this prison, which is why every bone

282
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,700
我不应该帮他们把你弄出去
in my body is telling me to do the opposite.

283
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,200
那你为啥还要这么做
Then why are you doing it?

284
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,400
有人拿走了你的书你就不高兴了
You're upset because someone took a book from you.

285
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,100
这是那帮家伙从我这里抢走的
This is what they took from me.

286
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,700
所以 跟你直说了
So let's be clear.

287
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,500
我在乎的是她 不是你
This is what matters to me, not you

288
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,400
也不是你的什么书
and not your book.

289
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,350
喂
Hello.

290
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,020
表哥 还行吧
Cousin, how is it?

291
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,420
你好啊 奥古斯特
Hey, Augusto.

292
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,680
你说呢 兄弟
You tell me, man.

293
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,490
生意就是那样 老大
Oh, business is cyclical, don dada.

294
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,460
有时候好 有时候坏
Ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows, you know.

295
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,970
看起来最近不怎么样啊?
Seems like there's more ebbing than flowing these days, huh?

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,860
你说呢
You think?

297
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,010
我跟你说说我的想法
I'm gonna tell you what I think, man.

298
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,210
我看有个黑心鬼想抢走我的生意
I think a black heart is trying to steal my business.

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,950
趁我不在的时候想干坏事了
Is taking advantage of my situation.

300
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,410
我有没有说错啊?
If there are mistakes have been made,

301
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,890
对我坦诚点
all I need is some honesty, man.

302
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,000
不是这样的 我发誓
No mistakes, patron, I swear.

303
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,870
那看起来问题不是出在你这儿了

还回充电座 我们都会完蛋 明白了吗?

如果你可以把东西给我的话
you'd take things south of the border.

406
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,100
别激动
Now, hold on.

女人总需要打扮的

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,720
什么? 她说来不及了
What? She said it was a lost cause.

459
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,920
她说她已经知道来不及了
She said she could see it was a lost cause.

460
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,750
然后?
So?

461
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,640
patr saint的失败原因就是圣丽塔
The patr saint of lost causes is Saint Rita.

462
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,030
她从来没有告诉我们他们在哪
She was never telling us where they were.

463
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,190
她告诉我们从他们那可以看到什么
She was telling us what they could see from where they were.

467
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,980
她说他们好像子夜才能和我们接头
She said, it's like they were giving us until midnight,

468
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,180
但是她说她坐在3点处
but she was sitting at 3:00 a.m.

469
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,260
这到底算什么意思?
What the hell does that mean?

470
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,570
我不知道 也许他们离钟之类的很近
I don't know. Maybe they're near a clock or something.

471
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,240
我知道的就这些
That's all I got.

472
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,950
我要走了

勒齐 
Lechero 

476
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,910
你需要知道这事
There's something you should know.

477
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,760
什么
What?

478
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,360
我想那个理发师他 
I think that barber might have 

479
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,710
划到我的头了吗?
Uh cut me?

480
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,890

481
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,800

你知道吗 实际上 这个 
You know, in fact that-that there

485
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,210
也许是我见过理的最好的了
might just be the best shave I have ever seen.

486
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,540
伙计 你看起来哪天你也要理一个
Boy, you look like you need one today.

487
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,820
也许我也要理一个
I might just do that.

488
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,100
四处走走 看看
Can't be walking around, looking all, uh, bhuttu.

489
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,620

什么也没做
I'm doing nothing to James Whistler.

496
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,520
我们现在在同一条船上对吧
Listen, we're on the same team, all right?

497

你想那小子从索纳监狱出来对吧

我不知道他对你说了什么 也不知他的真实身份
I don't know what he's told you, or who he is.

508
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,110
我知道他是谁

好吧 他是别人都热盼他出来的渔夫
Right. A fisherman that people want out so badly

510
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,020
那些人甚至绑架我儿子来交换他

听着

00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,110
我在找一个雕像纪念碑
I'm looking for a statue, a monument.

516
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,410
圣 圣丽塔 这上面这么说

我来告诉你 不需要提防我
Let you know you don't have to watch your back.

524
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,820
确定我也不需要警惕你
Make sure I don't have to watch mine.

525
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,020
我的命曾经是可以让人从这里出去的门票
My head was a free tick out of here.

我不记恨
I don't begrudge anyone

527
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,520
那些曾经尝试要我命的人
who did what they had to do to try and get it.

528
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,920
除此之外
Besides 

529
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,020

你到巴拿马来干嘛呢?
What the hell are you doing in Pana?

539
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,720
我不想谈这个
I'm not really in the mood.

540
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
你是那个警察 对么?
You're that cop, are you?

541
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,410
你知道我曾经看着斯科菲尔德
You know, I was looking at that Scofield.

542
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,520
想不出来为什么他看起来那么脸熟
I was trying to figure why he looked so bloody familiar.

543
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,620
现在 听到你的声音
Then, just now, hearing your voice,

544
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
我记得看过最初的新闻发布会

545
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,520
现在 你们又聚到了一起
And now you're in here together.

546
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,120
世界真小
Small world.

547
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,420
你想把他弄出去吗?
You trying to get him out of here?

548
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,610
引渡或者用其他什么方式?
Extradition or what?

549
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,320
我现在不干那个工作了
I'm not really in that line of work anymore.

550
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,110
他是个什么人呢?
What's he all about?

551
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,220
我是指斯科菲尔德
Scofield?

552
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,020
我是说 他危险么?
I mean, is he dangerous?

553
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,820
关你什么事?
What's it to you?

554
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,120
只是好奇
Just curious 

555
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,820
我要相处的家伙是什么类型的
as to what kind of chap I'm dealing with.

556
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,220
我想这取决于你为什么要跟他打交道了
I guess that depends on why you'd be dealing with him.

557
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,410
如我所说 你不知道何时 
Like I said never know when you'll 

558
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,720
就需要朋友
Need a friend.

559
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,820
关于斯科菲尔德是这样的
See, one thing about Scofield is that,

560
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,210
对于他关心的人
for those that he cares about,

561
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,120
他会为他们做任何事情
he'll do just about anything.

562
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,420
如果他不喜欢你 他随随便便就可以整死你
But he'll screw you three ways to Sunday if he doesn't.

563
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,720
现在我知道你是属于哪一类了
I can guess which side you ended up on.

从我这里了解更多关于斯科菲尔德的事

573
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,620
这我就不知道了 朋友
That I do not know, my friend.

574
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,510

她是我在这里的原因

00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,650
那好 除非这个索非亚也被枪指着
Well, unless this Sofia is being held at gunpoint,

613
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,150
我们没有共同点
we got nothing in common.

614
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,740
但是你也许可以告诉我
But maybe you can start by telling me

615
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,750
为什么中情局对你这么感兴趣
why the Company's so interested in you.

616
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,750
什么中情局?
What company?

617
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,050
我没时间和你玩
I don't have time for games.

618
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,950
好 好 听着
Okay, okay, look.

619
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,240
我在这里和
Look, I've been splitting time between here

620
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,040
西北太平洋之间跑船
and the Pacific Northwest running charters.

621
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,740
捕鱼是吗
Fishing?

622
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,340
对 捕鱼
Fishing,

623
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,650
观光 只要可以赚钱的都干
sightseeing whatever was paying the bloody rent.

624
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,840
一年前 我带了一个人出海
Now, abo year ago, I took a guy out.

625
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,050
他是个自然科学家什么的
He was some sort of naturalist.He was, uh 

626
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,540
他采集水样测量
he was taking water samples, measurements.

627
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,240
为了什么?
What for?

628
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,150
我不知道
I don't know.

629
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,440
我对此毫不关心
I didn't really care as long as the check cleared,

630
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,240
但有件事情
but here's the thing.

631
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,840
几个月后 我接到了一个电话
A few months later, I get a call from somebody

632
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,450
想知道我带那人去了什么地方
wanting to know where I took the guy.

633
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,250
我告诉他们我不记得了
And I told them I couldn't remember.

634
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,150
但是后来 
But then these, um 

635
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,040
政府模样的人
then these government types,

636
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,750
他们来找我 开始问我问题
they started showing up at my flat asking questions,

637
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,050
我不知道怎么做
and I didn't know what to do.

638
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,050
所以我就躲了起来 就逃到了巴拿马
So I got low, I came down to Panama,

639
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,750
我一直和索菲亚住在一起
and I moved in with Sofia full time.

640
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,240
直到 酒吧打架事件的发生
Until Until the fight at the bar.

641
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,350
是的 我最终到了这里
Yeah, and then I end up here,

642
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,550
以前那帮人又来探视我
where those same people show up at visitation

643
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,950
说他们会把我弄出去
saying they're going to get me out.

644
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,140
作为回报 我把他们带回之前去的地方
And when they do, I'm to take them to the same place

645
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,350
就是我带那个家伙去的那个地方
that I took that guy.

646
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,550
这就是为何需要被你哥抢走的书的原因
That's why I need the book your brother copped.

647
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,750
那是我航程日志
It's my trip log.

648
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,340
我在空白处作了标记 坐标 路标之类
I write notes in the margins, you know, coordinates, landmarks.

649
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,140
我需要循着原路返回
I need to retrace my steps and find that location.

650
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,450
-我没有选择 -这真是个有趣的故事
I don't have a choice. That's a really interesting story,

651
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,040
但是如果那本书真的如你所说
but if that book's as valuable as you say it is,

652
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,650
我应该留着它
maybe I should hold onto it for a little while,

653
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,550
直到我跟他们做完这个交易
make sure they hold up their end of the deal.

654
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,050
你还不理解 是么?
You don't get this, do you?

655
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,340
我需要时间去做 
I need time to be able to 

656
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,650
我唯一要做的事情就是带你离开这里
The only thing I'm responsible for is getting you out of here.

657
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,150
你们之间的事和我无关
Whatever's between you and them is between you and them.

658
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,150
我很遗憾
I'm sorry

659
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,350
没关系
All right.

660
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,750
你想到该怎么做了吗
Do you have any idea how we're going to do this?

661
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,550
我一直听说没人从这里出去过
All I keep hearing is how no one gets out of this place.

662
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,150
我想我也听过
I think I've heard that one before.

663
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,950
甘蔗好甜
The sugarcane's so sweet.

664
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,950
芒果也很甜 女人也 
The mangoes' so sweet, the women so 

665
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,250
如果这不是演艺人员
Well, if it isn't the entertainer.

666
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,950
给我们说个笑话如何
How about a joke for us, boy?

667
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,250
伙计 现在不是时候 我得 
Not now, fellas, I got to get 

668
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,740
何不给我们跳个舞呢?
Why don't you do a little dance for us, huh?

669
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,250
比如一段热舞?
How about a little jig, huh?

670
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,550
或许你要借只手吧?
Maybe you need an extra hand?

671
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,250
你说的真对
You got me.

672
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,450
没错
Yeah, that's right.

673
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,740
我知道你的伎俩
I do get you, boy.

674
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,950
你骗得了他 但骗不了我
You might've fooled him, but you're not fooling me.

675
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,650
老大 打扰了
Excuse me, boss.

676
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,950
我让你别进来的
I asked you for privacy.

677
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,850
我只是来 
Just came in here to, to 

678
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,840
谢谢你让我在这里帮忙的
thank you for giving me a hand up in here,

679
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,540
尽管如此 我只是想
but if it's all the same, I'd just like to be

680
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,950
减轻我的责任
relieved of my duties.

681
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,040
你在说什么?
Wh are you talking about?

682
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,050
有些 
There's some, um 

683
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,050
关于忠诚的问题 我还不想
loyalty issues going on, and I do not want to end up

684
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,840
在我对你的忠诚和
torn between my fidelity to you and the reality

685
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,940
被人指着鼻子的现实中做出取舍
of having to keep my nose clean.

686
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,340
我很早就知道
I've been around long enough to know

687
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,640
多米诺牌开始倒塌的时候
that when the dominoes start falling,

688
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,940
往往会怪新来的人
it's the new guy that gets blamed

689
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,050
撞到桌子
for bumping the table.

690
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,740
你最好别拐弯抹角 有话直说
You better stop spinning and start talking straight.

691
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,340
不
No 

692
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,350
我不是打小报告的人
I ain't no rat.

693
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,350
我不是让你 
I'm not asking you to be 

694
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,750
打小报告
a rat.

695
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,150
我是让你做我朋友 好吗?
I'm asking you to be a friend, huh?

696
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,650
就像我之前那样
As I've been with you.

697
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,450
好的
Okay.

698
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,340
早先我在散步
I was walking earlier,

699
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,740
我听到一些声音
and I heard some voices talking

700
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,040
让勒齐见鬼去吧
about,"To hell with Lechero.

701
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,450
我想要我那份
I want my cut."

702
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,040
我现在不能说他们是谁
Now, I couldn't tell who it was,

703
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,440
但当我走到角落的时候 我发现
but when I got around the corner, I recognized the faces 

704
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,650
那些脸我很熟悉 我在这里见过
the very same faces I've seen in this room.

705
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,840
我在这里得不到什么好处
Now, I got nothing to gain here, okay?

706
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,540
我不是什么人物
I'm a nobody

707
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,550
也成不了什么大人物
w-with no hope of being anyone.

708
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,740
但你身边的人
But those that surround you have

709
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,650
你下台后会得到一切
everything to gain if you fall.

710
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,750
我想我们两清了
I hope this makes us even.

711
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,450
但是我给你的 
But what I've given you 

712
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,150
不是帮一个忙就能回报的
can't be repaid with one favor.

713
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,150
所以我拒绝你的要求
So I deny your request,

714
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,450
你可以继续跟着我
and you're going to stay on

715
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,550
做我的耳目
as my ears.

716
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,750
当我不在的时候
You'll report back to me everything you hear

717
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:25,950
把你听到的都告诉我
when I'm not around.

718
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,250
Michael 过的怎样?
How've you been, Michael?

719
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,950
显然比某些人好
Better than some, apparently.

720
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,640
你知道 这太有意思了
You know, it's interesting

721
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,940
为什么你对你现在的住宿条件
how you don't seem rattled at all

722
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,550
一点也不恼火?
by our current accommodations.

723
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,540
是不是因为你觉得不会和他们在一起很久?
Could it be because maybe you're not planning on being in them much longer?

724
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,840
阿历克斯 还是和我之前告诉你的一样
It's like I told you before, Alex,

725
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,350
我们之间交情已了
this is the end of the line for both of us.

726
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,650
那这样吧
How about this?

727
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,350
我说错了你就不让我说
You stop me when I'm wrong.

728
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,840
那个中情局要你活着留在巴拿马
The Company wanted you here in Panama alive,

729
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,350
但是又诬陷你谋杀 而且是些奇怪理由
but framed for murder, and then for so for some strange reason

730
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,940
你很在意那个惠斯勒的生死
you seemed to really care about the fate of this Whistler guy,

731
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,740
我来告诉你一些事情吧
and I got to tell you something,

732
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,550
他对你也很好奇
he's really curious about you, too.

733
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,840
我们仔细想想 你有什么特殊才能让中情局
Let's see, what special talents do you have that the Company

734
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,340
让中情局觉得你活着比死了
might make the decision that you're worth

735
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,650
更有意义?
more to them alive than dead?

736
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,040
迈克 你怎么回答?
Huh, what do you say there, Mike?

737
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,040
我说到重点了吧
Am I getting warm yet?

738
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,750
我想你该吃药了
I think you better pop another pill,

739
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,150
因为全是胡扯
cause that's crazy.

740
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,750
那么你不介意我杀了他吧
Oh, so you don't mind if I kill him?

741
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,250
惠斯勒?
Whistler?

742
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,750
我想问题在于"中情局到底在意什么?"
I think the question is,"What would the Company mind?"

743
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,450
问题是"他们会对你做什么"
The question is,"What would they do to you?"

744
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,950
对你所爱的人做什么
To the ones you love?

745
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,750
阿历克斯 小心点
Be careful, Alex.

746
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,750
忙碌的一天?
Busy day?

747
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,950
没我希望的那样忙碌
Not as busy as I'd hoped.

748
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,150
你想要试试
Look, you had to try.

749
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,850
换作我 也会做跟你一样的事
I probably would've done the same thing myself if I were you.

750
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,350
但是让我们彻底说清楚
But let's be perfectly clear.

751
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,250
你以后都不可以再做这样的事
You're never going to try anything like that again.

752
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:16,950
我明白
I understand.

753
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,250
好 你最好真的明白了
Yeah, but just to make sure that you do,

754
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,550
我给你留了点东西在车库里
I left you a little something in the garage.
