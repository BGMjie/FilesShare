1
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,680
我的天
Oh, my God!

2
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,110
威廉森 快进来
Williamson, get in here!

3
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,320
这里怎么回事
What the hell happened in here?

4
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,110
一点小意外
An accident.

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,110
赶紧把他送去医务室 快
Let me get in here.Hold on. Come on

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,060
出去
Get out

7
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,470
我以为你只是想和他说些悄悄话
I thought you said you were gonna have a conversation with him

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,260
没错
Yeah, I did

9
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,200
事情有点过火而已
Things... escalated.

10
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,160
我们需要帮忙
We need some help here.

11
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,740
带他去3号房
Bring him on into three

12
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,530
凯希 给他十毫升麻醉药
Kathy, I'm gonna need 10ccs of Xylocaine

13
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,210
感谢帮忙 我来处理这事吧
Thanks, guys. I'll take it from here

14
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,460
我说了 谢谢 我会处理的
I said thank you. I'll take it from here

15
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,630
走吧
Let's go

16
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,900
好的
OK

17
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,310
让我看看你的脚
Let's take a look at you

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,990
你会没事的
You're OK. You're OK

19
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,830
发生了什么
What happened?

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,430
没什么
Nothing

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,720
这是没什么吗 迈克尔
This isn't nothing?Michael

22
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,800
我要知道发生了什么
I need you to tell me what happened

23
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,110
不要逼我对你说谎
Don't make me lie to you

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,250
拜托
Please

25
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,790
我希望内务部能对这件事进行调查
I think you had better start an investigation

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,890
不需要
Oh, there's no need.

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,430
我们很清楚发生了什么
We know what happened

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,050
那麻烦你告诉我
Perhaps you'd been good enoughto enlighten me

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,350
地上有一把除草剪刀
There was a pair of gardening shears

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,870
就在他工作的小屋子里
On the floor of the shed

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,960
很明显 他踩了上去
He stepped on them

32
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,760
然后刀锋直接穿过了鞋割伤了他的脚
The blade went right through his boot, huh?

33
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,830
是的
Yeah

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,490
但是为什么他的脚上没有鞋呢
So why wasn't the boot still on his foot?

35
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,730
我说过了 医生
Like I said, Doctor

36
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,470
我们已经搞定了这件事
We got it taken care of

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,080
走吧
Let's go

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,810
-我要把那个混蛋杀了  -不行
-I'll kill that scum.  -You won't.

39
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,130
你杀了他就等于扼杀了我们离开的机会
You kill him, you kill our ticket out of here

40
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,350
看他对你做了什么
Look what he did to you

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
我怕你活不过下一秒钟
You won't last a second here

42
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,250
如果我不做点什么
Unless I do something about it

43
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,770
你听过顶点飞行公司吗
You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?

44
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,310
听过
Yeah

45
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,380
他们运作中西部 一些小型机场的航线
They operate flights from small airfields in the Midwest

46
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,370
那公司离这里不到10英里
Like the one ten miles away.

47
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,320
属于阿布鲁奇名下的空壳公司
They're run by a shell corporation Abruzzi owns

48
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,130
如果我们跟他合作
We get him on board

49
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,550
就可以保证我们能在越狱的当晚
there'll be a flight for us

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,350
坐上飞机销声匿迹
The night we get outside these walls.

51
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,910
你愿意把逃亡的成败
You're willing to risk the entire escape

52
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,010
寄托在这个你根本不了解的人身上
On a guy you don't even know?

53
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,030
谋事在人
Preparation can only take you so far

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,480
但成事在天
After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith

55
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,330
我不相信阿布鲁奇是可以信任的
Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,140
不仅仅是阿布鲁奇
I'm not talking about Abruzzi

57
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,120
还有一人是关键人物
There's someone else who holds the key to this entire thing

58
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,310
有了他 才决定最后是成功还是失败
It either works or it doesn't

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,400
问题是
Problem is

60
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,720
我要进来以后 才能肯定这个人是谁
I couldn't know who that was until he got in here

61
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,910
苏克雷
Sucre?

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,630
你不是认真的吧
You can't be serious

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,390
那是一个贼 你不能相信他
The guy's a thief, Michael. He can't be trusted

64
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,240
必须相信他
Gonna have to trust him

65
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,020
因为他是我的室友
Because he's my cellmate

66
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,370
你对他了解多少
How well do you know him?

67
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,040
认识了不过一周
About as well as a man can in a week.

68
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,730
你告诉他等于告诉所有人
You tell him, he tells everyone

69
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,820
那样我们就完了 你明白吗
We're done.You know that, right?

70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,600
他不加入的话
If he's not on board

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,200
我没法在牢房做任何事
There's no digging in that cell

72
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,560
如果真的是这样
And if there's no digging

73
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,650
逃亡只是做梦
Then there's no escape

74
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,120
你好 请在 嘀 一声后留下口讯
Thank you for calling.Please leave a message after the tone

75
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,530
玛丽克鲁兹
Maricruz

76
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,790
是我 亲爱的 你在吗
It's me, baby. Are you there?

77
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,810
你在的话接电话 我被关禁闭了
Pick up if you're there, Mari.I've been in the SHU

78
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,360
我一直很想你
I've been thinking about you

79
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,490
想你迷人的身体
About your body

80
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,750
我一直在想你的身体
God, I've been thinking about your body

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,690
你好
Hello?

82
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,310
德尔加多太太
Mrs Delgado...

83
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,470
你好吗
Hi, how you doing?

84
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,350
我是费尔南多
It's me, Fernando

85
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,920
抱歉打扰你
Sorry to bother you at home

86
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,360
你知道玛丽克鲁兹的手机怎么了吗
Do you know what's up with Maricruz's cellphone?

87
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,880
一直都打不通 都是留言信箱
It just keeps going straight to voice mail

88
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,510
她大概把手机关掉了
Maybe she has it turned off

89
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,390
请问你知道她在哪里吗
Any chance you know where she is?

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,170
我当然知道
I know exactly where she is.

91
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,400
她在哪里
And that would be?

92
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,500
-和赫克特在一起   -赫克特
-With Hector.  -Hector?

93
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,510
是的
That's right

94
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,890
他们出去逛街了 我想
They're at the mall, I think

95
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,360
你不想我再见她了
I don't suppose next time you see her

96
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,040
你是不是能让她把手机打开
You could have her turn her phone back on?

97
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,370
德尔加多太太 我知道你不喜欢我
Mrs Delgado, I know you don't like me

98
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,010
但我爱你女儿 她也爱我
But I love your daughter and she loves me

99
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,080
我们快结婚了 你知道吗
We're gonna get married, you know?

100
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,610
如果你是一个明白人 你也真正爱她的话
If you were a decent man,and you really loved her

101
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,480
就不要再缠着她了
You'd let her live her life

102
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,920
这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

103
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,550
我会告诉她你打过电话来
I'll tell her you called

104
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,000
我想搞点破坏
I'm looking to do some damage

105
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,740
那你来对地方了
Well, you've come to the right place.

106
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,480
我要慢慢的那种
I want to do it slow.

107
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,140
造成最大痛苦的
Inflict the maximum amount of pain

108
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,740
让人求死不能
So a guy wishes he'd die

109
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,570
你明白的 就是那种快死了
And get it over with,

110
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,530
但又不会去见上帝的那种
But just can't quite get there.

111
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,720
明白
Oh, I got that.

112
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,330
明白了
I got that.

113
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,710
来看看这个吧 老大
Look at this right here, boss.

114
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,990
我宝贝的收割者
I call it the gutter.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,750
从胃那里插进去
You jam it in the stomach.

116
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,270
肠子都给拉出来
These bits hook the intestines.

117
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,480
只要轻轻一拉
You give it a pull back

118
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,990
那个可怜虫的内脏会乱成一团
poor sucker's guts are hanging right out of his stomach

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,750
他会像你说的那样
And he'll get a real good look at emcos

120
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,510
求死不能
The wound's not fatal

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,610
至少在伤口感染之前不会死
At least not until the infection sets in.

122
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,930
你真是一个变态的家伙 你知道吗
You're one sick puppy,you know that?

123
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,300
谢谢
Thank you.

124
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,340
你怎么了
What happened?

125
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,980
我很好
I'm OK.

126
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,890
他们打你了吗
They've gotten to you, haven't they?

127
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,940
那些囚犯
The other prisoners.

128
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,480
天呢 迈克尔 这地方会让你送命的
My God, Michael, this place is gonna kill you.

129
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,110
你说你跟一个女人有接触
You said you talked to a woman.

130
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,780
-她叫什么  -莱提莎
-What was her name?  -Leticia

131
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,010
-莱提莎・巴里斯  -你怎么知道
-Leticia Barris.  -How'd you know?

132
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,340
一年前 我也在做你现在同样的事情
A year ago I was doing exactly what you're doing

133
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,690
试图找出真相
Trying to find out the truth.

134
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,060
结果什么都没查到 维罗妮卡
It's a bottomless pit, Veronica.

135
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,380
他们都设计好了
They designed it

136
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,090
一旦你穷追不舍
So that when you got to the bottom of it

137
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,450
林肯也会被杀
Lincoln would be dead

138
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,330
你为什么不告诉我你也一直在查这事
Why didn't you tell me you were doing this ?

139
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,940
一旦日子定下来
Once the day was set

140
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,420
最终上诉被驳回
Once that final appeal had been rejected

141
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,530
他只剩下60天的时间
he had 60 days to live

142
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,690
我们不能任由他们摆布
I figured I could play their game

143
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,090
眼睁睁看着他死
and watch him die in the process

144
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,130
我要把事情掌握在自己手里
Or take matters into my own hands.

145
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,290
你不需要这样做
You don't have to do that

146
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,520
莱提莎知道一些东西 我要找出来
Leticia knows something. If I can get it out of her

147
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,920
也许能重开林肯的案子
Maybe we can reopen the case

148
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,590
她说什么了
What'd she tell you ?

149
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,820
她说有人
Somebody else

150
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,320
是这策划谋杀副总统兄弟的幕后黑手
was behind the killing of the vice president's brother.

151
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,650
谁 她走掉了
Who? She took off

152
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,000
在她说出来前就走掉了
Before I got anything out of her.

153
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,980
她是乐土计划的一部分
She's holed up in the Elysian Fields project.

154
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,400
我和她约了今天下午见面
I'll go see her this afternoon.

155
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,070
那地方很危险
That place is dangerous.

156
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,610
找人陪你去
Take someone with you.

157
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,110
谁
Who?

158
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,860
可能你的未婚夫会是一个好人选
Fiance'd be a good place to start.

159
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,650
我想这会是他最不愿意做的一件事
I think that's probably the last thing in the world Sebastian would ever want to do.

160
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,030
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

161
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,800
我也是
Me too.

162
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,170
没有前科 一个好学生
No priors, a good student.

163
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,500
因为贩药被抓住
Then you get yourself arrested for intent to sell.

164
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,660
好日子过腻了
 Good life get a little boring?

165
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,770
我一时糊涂
It was stupid

166
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,870
不会再发生这样的事情
It won't happen again

167
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,580
我们就是要确认这一点
Well, we're all here to make sure of that

168
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,560
你来之前我跟你母亲聊过
I took some to speak to your mother before you came in

169
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,580
她告诉我其实
She told me that

170
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,250
你这么做是有原因的
there were some extenuating circumstances...

171
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,110
如果你想说在监狱的那个人
If you mean that guy at Fox River,

172
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,110
他跟这事没有一点关系
He's got nothing to do with this.

173
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,390
他拒绝称呼他为父亲
He refuses to call him his father.

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,720
这个世界没有他会更好
The world would be better without him.

175
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,530
LJ
LJ

176
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,220
你的火气可不小啊 年轻人
It's clear to me you've got a lot of anger, young man.

177
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,620
这样的情绪会让你做错事
It could land you in the wrong place.

178
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,300
为了避免你再犯错
To make sure that doesn't happen,

179
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,400
每周你要向我报到一次
You'll check in with me once a week.

180
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,730
每周五 一小时
Fridays. One hour.

181
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,250
在学校不能无故缺席 成绩要良好
Your grades need to be pristine

182
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,190
当然
Absolutely.

183
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,340
同时我有一个建议
I will give you an really idea

184
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,240
你必须控制你的情绪 而不是被情绪控制
Where that anger will get you if you don't rein it in,

185
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,110
我会让你参加一个监狱辅导计划
I'll sign you up for the programme at Fox River.

186
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,640
在里面 你会有自己的导师
You'll have a mentor who you'll work with weekly.

187
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,190
每周与你见面并给你相关辅导
Give you some perspective.

188
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,660
导师
A mentor?

189
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,380
你的父亲
Your father.

190
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,930
告诉我这不是我想的那东西
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

191
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,990
这不是你想的那东西
It isn't what you think it is.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,980
小嫩鸡
Fish

193
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,710
你在这里有手机
A cellphone in here?

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,570
这是罪加一等
That's cardinal sin number one.

195
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,770
他们会在你刑期上加判你2年
They can tack two years onto your bid.

196
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,480
如果你被捉到的话
If they catch you.

197
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,980
你知道我会有麻烦
You know what trouble

198
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,620
就因为知道这事
I can get for knowing this?

199
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,720
那是不是我现在需要就可以打电话
Now, that means you can make calls whenever you want, right?

200
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,540
我不喜欢你现在的眼神
I don't like the look in your eye.

201
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,820
里面的东西 你从来没见过
What's in there, you never saw it

202
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,530
明白吗
Got it?

203
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,110
你为何不写下任何一个名字
Why didn't you include any names?

204
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,920
我为什么要让别人看着我死去
Why would I want anyone to watch me die?

205
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,320
我见过很多人
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

206
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,120
有些希望独自离去
Some people want to go it alone

207
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,900
而另一些却在死前还在唠唠叨叨
Others have grandiose statements they want to make

208
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,540
当然大部分人希望家人的陪伴
But most want some member of their family there

209
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,230
在他们离开这个世界的时候
Before they leave this world

210
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,410
我选择独自承受
I'll do it alone.

211
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,670
孩子 我的建议是
Son, in my opinion,

212
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,890
选择孤独离去的人
All inmates who have made that choice

213
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:17,420
多半在临死前 后悔自己的决定
Have deeply regretted it in their final minutes.

214
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,480
我
I'll...

215
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,230
你留着这份申请表
Leave it blank for now.

216
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,450
你剩下不到4周的时间
You have less than four weeks now.

217
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,760
再仔细考虑一下
You should give it some thought.

218
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,240
我要找 莱提莎・巴里斯
Hi, I'm looking for Leticia Barris.

219
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,720
5号房

220
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,100
谢谢
Thank you.

221
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,700
你好
Hello?

222
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,000
不要动
Don't you move a muscle.

223
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
冷静点 莱提莎
Take it easy, Leticia.

224
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,320
你和他们是一伙的 不是吗?
You're working with them , arn't you ?

225
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,910
别把我当傻瓜
You think I'm stupid, lady?

226
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,970
我知道我电话被监听了
I hear the clicks on my phone,

227
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,840
还有停在对面马路的车
I see the cars on the street.

228
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,170
我知道你很害怕 我也是
I know you're scared. I am too.

229
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,760
请你把枪放下
But, please, put the gun down.

230
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,360
你去哪里
Where you going?

231
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,770
爱尔兰 去哪里有何分别
Ireland. What difference does it make?

232
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,730
有分别
All the difference.

233
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,260
你不曾在法庭作供
Nobody got your testimony.

234
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,930
所以我现在还活着
That's the exact reason I'm still breathing.

235
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,070
我不是你的敌人 你一定要相信我
I'm not with them. You have to believe me.

236
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,320
那你偷偷来找我目的何在
What are you sneaking in here for?

237
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,870
我只是担心他们先来抓你
I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.

238
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
是吗
Oh, yeah?

239
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,710
你为什么这么关心我的处境
Why do you care about my wellbeing

240
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,230
只是一时兴起
All of a sudden?

241
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,490
不是的
I don't.

242
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,330
这才是句真话
Finally, an honest answer.

243
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,960
也许你可以救林肯
But maybe you can save Lincoln.

244
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,050
还有把杀你男友的人
And maybe you can bring down the guys who killed your boyfriend

245
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,400
绳之于法
In the process.

246
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,430
如果被杀的是你
If someone killed you

247
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,280
你男友也会这样做吧
And Crab could've done something to them

248
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,850
你以为他不会吗
You think he would have?

249
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,800
我没有他那么坚强
I'm not as strong as he was

250
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,630
我不能对付那些人
I can't take those people on.

251
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,970
我来对付那些人
I'll take them on.

252
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,990
你只需要来我办公室
All you have to do is come to my office

253
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,710
告诉我你所知道的
And tell me what you know

254
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,250
我会记录下来
I'll type it up

255
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,390
签署一份宣誓书后你就可以离开
You can sign the affidavit and split.

256
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:47,140
有需要我甚至可以 亲自送你去机场
I'll take you to the airport myself.

257
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,940
巴利克
Bellick.

258
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,090
怎么了 林肯
Hey, what's up, Lincoln?

259
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,890
下几个星期 我需要多一点外出的时间
I want extra time outside for the next two weeks.

260
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,950
但你一定要刷墙的
Paint fumes in PI must be getting to you.

261
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,920
这里允许带手机吗
Cellphones allowed in here?

262
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,340
谁
Who?

263
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,510
额外的放风时间
Extra time outside

264
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,390
还要一些烟
Couple cigarettes

265
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,610
每周半小时
Half-hour one week

266
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,350
一支烟
One cigarette

267
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,840
知道叫苏克雷的家伙
Know a con named Sucre?

268
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,630
我实在不明白 约翰
This is what I don't understand, John

269
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,130
菲波纳奇 指正你
Otto Fibonacci fingers you

270
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,150
他让你下半辈子蹲在大牢里
He put you in prison for life

271
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,380
你似乎对此漠不关心
Yet you act like you don't even want to find out where he is

272
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,560
这不是真的 菲利
That's not true, Philly.

273
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,560
是不是你觉得自己
Maybe you don't think you

274
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,780
已经一无所有了
Have anything to lose any more

275
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,700
你已经在里面了
You're already locked up.

276
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,860
你是不是
Maybe

277
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,500
喜欢呆在里面
You like it here

278
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,430
我不知道
I don't know.

279
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
我只是肯定
But what I do know is that

280
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,620
菲波纳奇 会在下月作证
If Fibonacci testifies next month

281
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,970
我快要成为你的邻居了
You and I are gonna be neighbours.

282
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,520
我不会让这一切发生
And I am not going to let that happen

283
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,140
我想你不会适应里面的环境的 菲利
I don't think you would fit in here, Philly.

284
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,860
名牌衬衣 领带和西装
Fancy suits and ties and shirts.

285
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,070
我想你是对的
I think you're right

286
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,120
我不想跟你废话
So let's cut to the chase.

287
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,130
你对付那小子没有
Did you break this kid?

288
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,850
他有没有告诉你 菲波纳奇 的下落
Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?

289
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:16,010
-这是什么  -一个小礼物
-What is this?  -It's a little gift from me to you.

290
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,210
-这是他的  -他不肯开口
-Are these his?  -Yeah. He won't crack

291
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:29,500
我想你要另找方法解决这事情
Well, perhaps you should consider using a different methodology then, John

292
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,460
据我所知
From what I gather

293
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,860
有些东西比肉体伤害更能让人屈服
there are far worse threats in prison other than bodily harm

294
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,470
记得以前你信任我
When you used to trust me, Philly

295
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,500
是因为我总能把事情办好
That I would get things done?

296
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,240
以前我信任你
That was

297
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,300
是因为你确实能把事情做好
When you actually did get things done.

298
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,730
爹地
Daddy!

299
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,890
你听到那消息了吗
Did you hear the news?

300
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,640
什么消息
What... what news?

301
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,360
我们会和 菲利 叔叔
We're going to stay with Uncle Philly

302
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,780
一起到湖边玩几个星期
At the lake for a few weeks

303
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,480
是的 我们会玩得很开心
Yeah, and we're gonna have a good time.

304
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,230
你是对的 约翰
You're right, John

305
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,320
我确实信任你
Maybe you're right.I do trust you.

306
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,110
而你不会让我失望的 对吗
Now, you're gonna take care of that thing, aren't you?

307
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,190
你的家属探访怎么样
How are those bone-yard visits

308
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,220
和你女友的那个
Going with that girlfriend of yours?

309
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,890
我想应该很不错吧
I imagine pretty good, huh?

310
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,690
你知道这是
You know visitation rules stipulate that conjugals

311
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,300
已婚犯人的专利
Are only for married couples.

312
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,940
我们订婚了
We're engaged

313
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,300
而且
Besides

314
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,000
我一向安分守纪
I got that coming to me because I ain't caused no static in this place

315
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,020
请不要剥夺我的权利
Please, don't dead my conjugals.

316
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,420
我不会的
I won't.

317
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,180
谢谢
Thank you.

318
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,810
但作为交换
But in exchange

319
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,410
我要你告诉我那手机的事情
You have to tell me where that cellphone is.

320
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,780
手机
Cellphone?

321
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,540
不要装傻
Don't play stupid with me

322
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,410
这是你保住操女人的权利的唯一机会
I'm giving you a chance to save your precious conjugals

323
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,110
如果你说谎 就什么都没了
You lie to me, they're gone

324
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,110
永远都不会有了
And they're never coming back.

325
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,060
那手机在哪里
Where's that cellphone?

326
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,570
特纳
Turner

327
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,650
你的换岗批准了
Your transfer came in.

328
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,040
上头要你负责管理
They want you in administration.

329
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,720
他没开口
He didn't talk.

330
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,360
作为回报 我只想打打电话
All I got to say is I better get to make all the calls I want.

331
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,060
这有点困难
Gonna be kinda hard.

332
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,720
肥皂
Soap?

333
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,200
我因为一块肥皂失去夫妻权利
I lost my conjugals over soap?

334
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,410
你是失去了一点权利
You may have lost your conjugals

335
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,140
但我会给你更多
But I can do you one better

336
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,070
让你们可以在一起
I can get you to her.

337
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,330
和玛丽克鲁兹
With Maricruz?

338
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,780
你让我们在一起 没错
You can get me to Maricruz?That's right

339
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,090
你要怎么做
How you gonna do that?

340
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,280
我们准备越狱
We're breaking out of here.

341
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,990
怎么做
How?

342
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,420
从我们的牢房开始
Starts in our cell

343
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,470
我们的牢房
In our cell?

344
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,540
告诉你
To tell you the truth

345
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,910
已经开始了
It's already started

346
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,360
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

347
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,940
你以为我想越狱
You think I want to break out of here?

348
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,830
再过16个月我就出去了
6 months from now I'm at the gate.

349
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
我要结婚了
I'm getting married,

350
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,270
我可不想在婚礼时被警察捉回去
And not with no posse on my ass.

351
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,700
伙计 我真想揍你
I oughta beat you six ways till Sunday.

352
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,030
我失去了我的权利
I lost my conjugals

353
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,630
就因为你的肥皂
Because of your little bar of soap.

354
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,260
我必须先测试一下你会不会泄密
I had to see if you could keep a secret.

355
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,500
你要秘密
You want a secret?

356
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,310
我告诉你个秘密
I got a secret for you, fish

357
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,140
你在我的牢房乱搞
You dig in my cell when I'm there

358
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,640
我鸡巴都给你割了
I'm gonna split your wig.

359
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,480
(西班牙语: 你的明白?)

360
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,500
现在安逸了
That went well

361
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,950
我们就从林肯和你男友的关系开始
Let's start with Lincoln's relationship with your boyfriend

362
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,370
很简单
Well,simple.

363
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,030
他欠我男友9万块钱 一直没法还清
He owed my man 90,000.He wasn't getting it done

364
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,060
突然间他有钱了
All of a sudden, it gets done

365
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,630
克拉勃 很高兴地拿着钱回来
Crab walks up with 90k and a big-ass smile

366
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
谁给他的钱
Who paid him?

367
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,520
不是林肯 有人帮他付的
Not Lincoln. They paid his marker.

368
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,780
那些人是谁
Who's they?

369
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,260
没事的 你现在很安全
It's all right, Leticia.I told you, you're safe here

370
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,720
我在家里见过他一次 就一次
Crab brought this guy home.Never seen him before

371
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,130
克拉勃 在做大生意的时候
Crab did what he always did

372
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,020
总是叫我出去
He told me to take a walk,so that's exactly what I did

373
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,100
关于那个男人
There was something about this guy

374
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,160
不像是克拉勃经常来往的那种人
He wasn't the kind he usually dealt with.

375
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,190
什么意思
What do you mean?

376
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,030
他们似乎不可冒犯
Couldn't put my finger on it till he went outside

377
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,170
我就知道
Then I knew

378
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,350
有那种感觉
He had that look

379
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,900
-怎样的感觉  -你知道
-What look?  -You know.

380
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,510
就像他们是掌权的人
Like they own the place

381
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,580
有一种权威的感觉
Like they're untouchable

382
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,600
就像是政府的人
Like they're government.

383
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,250
你说政府偿还了林肯的债务
So the government paid Lincoln's debt?

384
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,540
克拉勃有没有说他们想交换什么
Did Crab say what they wanted in return?

385
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,940
没
Uh-uh

386
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,220
好吧
All right

387
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,200
你等我一会把这些东西打好
Just give me a moment to type this up.

388
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,840
-你去哪里  -抽根烟
-Where are you going?  -I'll have a smoke

389
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,490
一分钟就好
This is only gonna take me a minute

390
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,920
我也是
So will the smoke

391
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,900
没有红肿说明没有发炎
No swelling, so there's no sign of infection

392
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,140
再打十天抗生素
I'll keep you on antibiotics for ten days.

393
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,700
你就会没事了
You should be good.

394
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,640
迈克尔 你要明白
Michael .You will understand

395
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,930
按照规矩 我要向上面报告
By law I must file a report

396
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,840
如果我知道囚犯之间有些什么
If I feel there has been prisoner misconduct?

397
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,120
这伤绝不可能是
There's no way this injury happened

398
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,250
意外踏上一把除草剪刀造成的
By stepping on a blade in a garden shed.

399
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,080
你报告上去 事情对我而言会变得更糟
If you file the report,things could get a lot worse.

400
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,650
现在还不够糟
They're not already?

401
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,040
比起他们能做的 这已经算好的了
Not compared to what they could be

402
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,080
我有不少敌人
I've made some enemies

403
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,210
嗯
Yeah

404
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,030
害怕吗
You scared?

405
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,820
好吧
Men. OK

406
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,960
我想你肯定会害怕
Here's what I think. I think you are scared.

407
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,560
如果不害怕那不正常
And you wouldn't be human

408
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,010
在这样的地方
If you weren't scared in a place like this.

409
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,090
我小的时候 晚上总是睡不着
When I was young, I couldn't sleep at night

410
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,430
总觉得衣橱里有怪物在窥视我
Because I thought there was a monster in the closet

411
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,800
我哥哥对我说
But my brother told me

412
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,670
门后面什么也没有 只有你的恐惧
There wasn't anything in the closet but fear,

413
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,480
那不是真实的
And fear wasn't real.

414
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,590
恐惧没有形态
He said it wasn't made of anything.

415
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,990
只是空气
It was just... air.

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,690
他还说
Not even that

417
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,260
你必须要面对它
He said you just have to face it

418
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,340
打开那扇门 怪物就会消失不见
You just have to open that door,and the monster would disappear.

419
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,510
你哥哥是一个聪明人
Your brother sounds like a smart man

420
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,020
是的
He is.

421
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,430
虽然在这里
In here, though

422
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,290
你勇敢的打开了门
You face your fear, you open that door,

423
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,780
但你发现后面还有一百扇门你要打开
And there's a hundred more doors behind it

424
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,410
而且门后的怪物
And the monsters that are hiding behind them

425
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,440
全部都是真实的
Are all real

426
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,640
如果你愿意 我可以申请把你送去文书区
If you want,I could recommend you be sent to ad seg

427
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,890
和一群强奸犯和小偷在一起
With the rape victims and the snitches.

428
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,410
这样可以保证你的安全
It would keep you safe.

429
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,060
谢谢
Thanks

430
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,180
我宁愿自己面对那群怪物
but I think I'd like to face the monsters on my own

431
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,620
抽完烟了
Have a good smoke?

432
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,270
我不抽烟
I don't smoke

433
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,990
希望没有吓到你
Didn't mean to startle you.

434
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,820
我是 凯勒曼 探员 特情局的
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service.

435
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,610
我们被告知
We've been informed that

436
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,980
你得到了一份保安录像的复本
you obtained a copy of the surveillance tape

437
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,700
是林肯布罗斯一案的重要证据
Entered as evidence in the Burrows trial.

438
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,660
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem with that?

439
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,950
我们只是来了解一下
 We're just following up

440
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,460
是不是公共资料法有什么更改
Has there been an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act that

441
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,300
我还不知道
I'm not aware of?

442
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,700
你知道当一个死囚
When a prisoner gets

443
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,070
即将行刑之前
close to the end of his time on death row

444
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,060
总是有很多无谓的努力
There's a lot of last-minute...

445
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,740
抱歉 我不明白
I'm sorry.I don't understand

446
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,000
是什么引起特情局的关注
Why this would be a problem for the Secret Service

447
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,100
没有
It's not

448
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,690
只是这案子的判决绝对勿庸置疑
The prosecution made its case far beyond any reasonable doubt

449
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,140
而我们清楚我们抓对了人
and we know that we have the right man

450
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,060
不过 万一你有可能找到
That being said, if you come across anything

451
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,660
证明犯人无罪的证据
That could shed some light on his innocence,

452
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,940
-我们会全力提供协助  -听起来不错
-I'm offering my help.  -Sounds great

453
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,860
感谢你特意告诉我这些
I really appreciate you coming by

454
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,860
你有名片吗 凯勒曼 探员
Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?

455
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,510
当然
Of course.

456
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
随时给我电话
Don't hesitate to call.

457
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,650
当然
Thanks

458
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,550
莱提莎
Leticia

459
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,430
-塞巴斯蒂安 很抱歉  -你在哪里
-Sebastian, I'm so sorry.  -Where are you?

460
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,170
对不起 现在不是时候
This isn't the time. I'm sorry

461
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,570
已经是约定时间 我现在接待室
This is the time. I'm at the reception hall.

462
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,350
中介来了
The coordinator is here

463
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,050
卖家也到了
the vendors is too

464
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,610
听着 我非常抱歉
Look, I-I'm just...I'm sorry

465
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,510
现在不方便说话
I-I can't talk right now

466
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,530
我们把他整条腿卸掉好了
I say we take his whole foot.

467
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,750
我们可以把他的四肢都砍掉
We could cut off all his limbs

468
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,350
但他还是不会说一个字
He still wouldn't talk

469
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,830
痛苦有时不能解决问题
Pain is not the answer here.

470
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,540
或者只有披头士乐队是对的
Maybe the Beatles were right after all

471
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:23,620
我们需要的只是爱
Maybe all you need is love

472
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,230
你在做什么
What are you doing?

473
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,540
你觉得我在做什么 在收拾东西
What does it look like? I'm rolling it up

474
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,790
你不能这样做
You can't do this

475
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,070
我不会参与你的疯狂计划
I'm done with your reindeer games

476
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,200
我要去一个普通的 正常的牢房
I'm gonna transfer to a nice,quiet cell with a normal cellie

477
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,940
去一个不会把我毁掉的地方
One that doesn't screw my entire life up

478
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,720
听着
Look

479
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,720
对你失去权利我很抱歉
I'm sorry about your conjugals

480
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,630
如果你现在离开
But if you go now...

481
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,060
不要这样 拜托
Don't do this. Please

482
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,430
听我说
Listen to me, fish.

483
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,300
我只有16个月
I got 16 months

484
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,290
我还有未婚妻在外面
I got a fiance to think about

485
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,130
如果我做这样的事
I get caught with a hole in my wall

486
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,530
我要再过五年才能看见外面的世界
I don't get to see the real world for another five years

487
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,900
走吧 苏克雷
Let's go, Sucre

488
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,130
我不会这样做
I can't do that

489
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,150
凡事总有解决的办法 我们可以商量
There is a solution. We can work it out.

490
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,670
对不起 小嫩鸡
Sorry, fish

491
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,880
可以问个问题吗
Can I ask you something?

492
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,750
你为何不愿意
Why have you denied

493
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,070
让家人和至爱陪你走最后一程
 any family or loved ones to be there for you in the end?

494
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,100
为何要让他们看着我死去
Why would I let them watch me die?

495
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,520
我已经带来很多痛苦
I've caused them enough pain.

496
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,140
也许并不是他们看着你死去
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

497
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,920
你意思是我看着他们好好活着
Maybe it's about me watching them live.

498
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,070
-让我因此内心煎熬  -不是的
-That the final torture?  -No

499
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,070
在你离开这个世界的时候
It's about how you want to leave this world.

500
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,130
你希望最后带走怎样的影像
What's the last image you want to take with you?

501
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,560
一个陌生人
A stranger?

502
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,680
想对那边的小朋友做什么
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

503
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,970
不需要你同意
You don't need consent

504
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,290
这跟你没什么关系
You don't give the green light.

505
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,500
这里的所有事情都需要我的同意
Everything in here runs through me.

506
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,070
你知道的
You know that.

507
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,500
梅・塔格 就是因为他才死了
May Tag's in the ground because of that piece of detritus

508
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,880
所以你要他偿还
So now you want him

509
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,840
用他剩下的每一天
Every day for the rest of his bid.

510
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,300
似乎英雄所见略同
Seems you and I have something in common

511
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,250
进去
Get in!

512
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,620
放松点 小嫩鸡
Easy, now, fish

513
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,360
不要让大家都不好过
Don't make this any harder than it needs to be

514
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,510
下面我们将会有些安排
It's time we came to an arrangement

515
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,780
你不反对吧
Don't you think?

516
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,790
我在想怎样把你的内脏狠狠地取出
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you bow to stern

517
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,680
就在我们眼神接触的瞬间
As soon as I laid eyes on you

518
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:04,640
我想你痛苦的样子一定很漂亮 不是吗
But, alackaday, you look so pretty when you're scared, don't you?

519
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,700
也是我爱的表达方式
I'll get the love out of the way

520
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,760
爱到极点就是恨
Before the hate

521
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,370
你觉得呢 帅哥
What do you say, pretty?

522
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:18,870
也许是时候我们好好了解一下对方
Maybe it's time I lit up that leather once and for all, huh?

523
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,150
鸟人废话是多
God, he talks too much.

524
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,290
我们需要好好聊聊
You and I need to have a conversation.

525
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,440
里面发生的事表明了我的态度
What happened in there was my way of saying

526
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:48,820
之前我们有点小误会
I know I've been going about this whole thing the wrong way.

527
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,280
我想表示一点歉意
I'm trying to make amends here

528
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,360
过去的就过去了
Bygones be bygones

529
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,550
你真善变啊 约翰
You're a mercurial man, John

530
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,420
我更认为是有胆识
I prefer bold.

531
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,200
说你想从我这里得到什么
Tell me what you need from me

532
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,720
交易
A trade

533
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,070
你给我飞机
You get me a plane

534
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,370
我给你 菲波纳奇
And I'll get you Fibonacci

535
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,520
你要飞机做什么
What do you need a plane for?

536
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,830
我想你知道的
I think you know

537
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,900
我帮你的话 我也搅进去了
I help you, I'm in

538
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,130
你知道的 对吧
You know that, don't you?

539
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,640
当然
I do

540
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,470
我要知道准确的日期和时间
Just gotta know the exact date and time

541
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,750
很快我会告诉你
I'll tell you soon enough

542
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,910
迟则作废
Soon enough won't cut it

543
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,190
在 菲波纳奇 作证之前
I need to be outside before Fibonacci testifies

544
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,000
没问题
You will be

545
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,000
只有不到一个月了
He testifies in one month

546
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,650
还有很多时间
Then you'll be out in plenty of time

547
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:43,480
如果做不到 你死定了
If not, you're a corpse

548
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,190
长话短说
So cut the crap

549
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,570
我要知道日期和时间
Tell me the exact date and time

550
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,480
我才能安排
So I can start making the arrangements

551
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,500
我还不确定是否应该相信你
I don't know if I can trust you yet

552
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:51,970
为什么
Why not?

553
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,870
我说过了 因为你很善变
Like I said, John, you're a mercurial man

554
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,990
路易斯 把这些解开
Lewis, take these off

555
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,500
我不能这样做
Sink, I can't do that

556
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,440
伙计 我在牢里
Come on, man. I'm in a cage

557
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,280
十分钟
Ten minutes

558
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,800
求你
Please

559
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,560
是我儿子
It's my kid

560
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,230
我们又见面了
So, here we are

561
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,400
是的

562
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,060

你知道的 有点麻烦
You know, in trouble.

564

565
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,330
很好
She's good

566
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,720
我跟牧师聊天
I've been talking to the chaplain

567
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,160
他们要我决定谁 呃
They'd like me to decide on who I should have at the...

568
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,670
我想说的是
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

569
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,050
直到最后一刻 你才会意识到
When you get to the end,you start to realise

570
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,910
什么是最重要的
What's important to you

571
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,960
谁是无法取代的人
You know, who really matters to you.

572
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,420
然后 你知道
And, you know

573
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,780
我说的是你和迈克尔
That leaves you and Mike

574
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,490
唯一与我有血缘关系的亲人
The only blood I got left in this...

575
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,990
在这个世界上
this world

576
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,900
我想说
Yeah, I gotta say

577
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,620
我不是很懂你在说什么
I'm not really following what you're saying

578
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,350
只是
Well, uh...

579
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,560
到了最后
In the end

580
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,500
我的心里只剩下爱
The only thing that matters is love

581
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,520
血缘 家人 还有 你
Blood, family, you

582
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,800
给我你的手
Um...Give me your hand

583
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,640
你在做什么
What are you doing?

584
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,750
给我你的手
Give me your hand

585
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,940
你的手
Give me your hand

586

我想你能来
I want you to be there when...

587
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,710
在我行刑的那天
I want you to be there the day before I die.

588
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,100
让我看见你
So I can see you.

589
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,210
我可以抱抱你
So I can hold you.

590
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,260
我

591
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,710
我爱你
I love you

我一直都爱你
I've always loved you

593
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:54,040
这一切
This whole thing...

594
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:00,040
我不知能否能够承受
I don't know if I can take it

595
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,550
我也是
Me either

596
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,450
但我别无选择
I don't have a choice

597
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,680
但你有
You do

598
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,500
我很抱歉
I am so sorry

599
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,820
今早我和一位女士会面
I met with this woman today

600
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,750
她知道林肯案子的一些内情
And she knew things about Lincoln's case

601
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,910
然后她就消失了
Then she just disappeared

602
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,220
我想她出事了
I think something happened to her

603
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,310
听着
Look.

604
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
我尽量把话说得简单点
I'm gonna make this real easy for you

605
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,650
你还想跟我结婚吗
Do you want to get married

606
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,920
还是不想
Or not?

607
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,700
我不知道
I don't know

608
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,060
很好
Wonderful

609
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,820
或许我们可以延期
Maybe we could postpone it

610
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,230
现在我不能
I can't do this right now

611
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,410
我没心思在这上面
I had thoughts in it

612
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,780
这应该是一件值得高兴的事
It's supposed to be a celebration...

613
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,620
如果你这样说
If you're really telling me

614
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,110
你希望延期婚礼
You want to postpone this thing

615
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,200
那么我想还是算了吧
then I want to cancel it.

你运气不错在精神病区转送过来一个人
