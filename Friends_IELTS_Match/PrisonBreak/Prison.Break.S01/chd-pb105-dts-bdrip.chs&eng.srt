1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,890
放下武器
Put down your weapon.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,710
我有充分证据来判你有罪
I find it incumbent you see the inside of a cell.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,950
我正在找人  那家伙叫 林肯・布伦斯
I'm looking for someone, guy named Lincoln Burrows.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,580
那家伙杀了副总统的兄弟
Man killed the VP's brother.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,280
为什么你这么着急想见布伦斯
Why you want to see Burrows so bad, anyhow?

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,310
因为他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,620
-我正想法把你弄出去  -这不可能
-I'm getting you out.  -It's impossible.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,780
如果我是这里的设计人 就有可能
Not if you designed the place,it isn't.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,190
-你看过这儿的设计图纸了   -不仅如此
-You've seen the blueprints.  -Better than that.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,000
我把它纹在身上了
I've got'em on me.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,520
你查到是谁想害他么
You find out who's trying to bury him.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,210
-没人想害他  -那证据是伪造的
-Nobody's trying to bury him.  -The evidence was cooked.

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,730
有个律师在多管闲事
There's a lawyer poking around.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,400
对任何危害到我们的人都是可以消失的
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,860
我要杀了那人渣
I'm gonna kill that scum.

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,090
不能那样  如果你杀了他 你就毁了大家逃出去的希望
You won't. You kill him, you kill our express ticket out of here.

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,350
你来这儿干吗  玛丽克鲁兹 呢
you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,710
她现在和我在一起
She's with me now.

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,540
听着  我必须回那儿去
Fish, I gotta be back in.

20
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,230
尼克・萨维恩 的那个司法案子
Nick Savrinn with Project Justice.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,840
我的老板认为林肯的案子 已经没有再跟进的必要了
My boss may not think Lincoln's case is worth looking into,

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,730
但我可不这么想
but I do.

23
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,750
我们什么时候动手
When do we get started?

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,830
打穿这堵墙只是第一步
Getting through this wall is just the beginning.

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,370
这堵墙和外面还隔着好多呢
There's a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls.

26
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,290
这是份移送的文件
That is a transfer request.

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,480
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德明早会被转到其他监狱去了
Michael Scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,740
我想你们是为 迈克尔・斯科菲尔德 的那份移交申请来的吧
I assume this is about your transfer request for Michael Scofield.

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,510
更确切地说 为什么你拒绝
More specifically, why you denied it.

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,500
听着  克勒曼先生 我可没跑到你家
Look, Mr Kellerman, do I come to your house

31
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,410
然后对你家里家具摆设指手画脚
and tell you where to put your furniture?

32
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,810
我们只是帮你一个小忙而已
We're just asking for professional courtesy.

33
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,610
我这个小小的州监狱可承受不了 你们联邦政府的好意
But you're asking for a federal courtesy in a state penitentiary.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,330
多数在你位置上的人
Most people on your position would be happy

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,350
都会很乐意这件事让别人接手的
to have a body taken off their hands.

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,060
惩罚那些人是我的责任
These men are my responsibility.

37
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,910
从他们踏进那儿起
From the minute they walk through those walls

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,090
直到他们还清了社会责任为止
to the time they've paid their debt to society,

39
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,650
我都会对他们负责
I'm responsible for them.

40
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,720
也就是说除非 斯科菲尔德 他做了什么我还不知道的事
Which means that unless he's done something I don't know about,

41
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,350
他就将一直在我的监管下待在这儿
he is gonna stay here at Fox River under my watch.

42
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,250
普柏 先生 在我们的调查中
Mr Pope, in our line of work,

43
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,710
刚好发现一些其他人还不知道的事
we've discovered that just about everyone has done something that someone doesn't know about.

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,670
这是什么
What's this?

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,810
目前看 还只是一段过去的事情而已
Right now, just a piece of history.

46
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,430
至于是不是将会变成现在时 就看你怎么做了
Whether it becomes a current event,now, that's up to you.

47
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,230
我妻子已经知道 托雷多 的事了
My wife already knows about Toledo.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,840
是么
Does she really?

49
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,810
你是个聪明人  监狱长先生
You're a smart man, Warden.

50
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,980
我相信如果你仔细看
I'm sure if you look hard enough,

51
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,080
你肯定能找到一个原因来解释
you could find a reason why Michael Scofield's presence is no longer required

52
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,930
为什么 迈克尔・斯科菲尔德 不再需要呆在这儿了
at this particular correctional facility.

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,990
这儿需要更多的管子  长官
I need some more PVC here, boss.

54
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,220
-长官  -这个很常见 布伦斯
-Boss?  -Sure thing, Burrows.

55
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,780
但  听着  我可不想挨个找碎片去
But, hey, I don't wanna check for splinters.

56
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,360
-我希望每一片都有去处   -当然
-I want every piece accounted for.  -Sure.

57
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,570
我发现里面有袋撕破了的化肥
I got a ripped fertilizer bag inside.

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,460
嘿  你
Hey, you!

59
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,710
就是你
You!

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,190
去把里面清理干净
Get in there and clean it up

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,750
否则里面太难闻了
before this whole place starts smelling like San Juan.

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,170
嘿  他正朝这儿走来
OK, he's on his way.

63
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,090
能告诉我究竟发生什么了吗
Do you mind telling me what this is all about?

64
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,010
这些就都是要越狱的
These are the guys we're breaking out with.

65
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,950
我可不这么想  小子
I don't think so, fish.

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,810
之前我们可不是这么说的
That was not our agreement.

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,750
我可不想和这些
I'm not gonna work with this

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,050
-和这些疯子一起  -你再说阿
-crazy rhino.  -Keep pushing it, John.

69
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,770
是的 我就要说
Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,870
那你能做些什么
What's your deal, man?

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,690
再动我的兄弟试试  我就会让你知道
Touch my brother again and I'll show you.

72
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,870
兄弟  你的兄弟
Brother? Your brother?

73
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,400
我们只有几分钟的时间
We've only got a few minutes.

74
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,770
我们是用它来互相扯皮
We're gonna spend them spitting on each other,

75
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,310
还是一起谈点正事儿
or are we gonna talk some business?

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,480
我们现在必须作出一个决定
The reason we're all here today is we have a decision to make.

77
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,590
英格力士  费兹  还是博西
English, Fitz, or Percy.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,990
如果我们想成功越狱
If we're gonna pull this off,

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
我们就得在这几个中选一个
we need to take one of them out.

80
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,420
你想让我们告诉你选哪个么
And you want us to tell you which one?

81
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,980
我只是想让你们帮我想清楚
I just want you to help me get to them.

82
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,090
-我会作出判断  -你疯了 你知道吗
-I'll take it from there.  -You're crazy.

83
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,090
-我只需要五分钟   -你连五秒钟都没有
-All I need is five minutes. -You won't get five seconds.

84
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,150
我以为你什么都搞定了
I thought you had everything worked out.

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,110
我们不是要逃出一家连锁店而已 先生们
We're not breaking out of a Jamba Juice.

86
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,030
不仅仅需要挖几个洞
It's gonna take more than digging a few holes.

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,520
这里有这么多耳目监视
There are eyes, ears,

88
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,390
根本不可能与外面联系
dots that couldn't be connected from the outside.

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,410
-那英格力士  费兹  博西   -正是计划的一部分
-And English, Fitz or Percy?  -One of those dots.

90
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,870
那你究竟想怎么搞定这些事
And how exactly are you supposed to pull this off?

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,440
我的朋友会帮助我的
With a little help from my friends.

92
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,010
苏克雷  等一下
Sucre, hold up.

93
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,210
斯科菲尔德  有人要见你
Scofield, you've got company.

94
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,150
为什么我总觉得你有事瞒着我呢   斯科菲尔德
Why do I get the feeling that there's more to you than meets the eye, Scofield?

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,960
有什么事想说的吗
Anything you wanna tell me?

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,760
你进来的原因  除了抢银行之外
Some other reason you're in here besides holding up a bank?

97
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,980
-你会被转走  -什么
-You're being transferred.  -What?

98
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,760
你会被转移到 斯特斯维尔
We're moving you over to Statesville.

99
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,760
-你不能这么做  -不 我能
-You can't do that.  -Yes, I can.

100
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,270
我是这儿的头 这儿我说了算
I'm the boss here.This is my house.

101
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,450
-我要三个星期的时间  -什么
-Three weeks.  -What for?

102
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,450
林肯・布伦斯
Lincoln Burrows.

103
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,970
三周后他将被处决
He's being executed in three weeks.

104
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,900
恩  这个我知道 可这儿和你有什么关系
I'm aware of that. What's that to you?

105
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,500
他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

106
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,310
当我知道我要被判刑
When I knew I was being sent to prison,

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,050
我的律师就请求监狱总局
my attorney petitioned the DOC.

108
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,830
-这样你就能和他在一起了  -没错
-So you could be near him.  -That's right.

109
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,830
别把我转走
Don't take that away from me.

110
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,790
至少在这一切都结束前
Not until it's over.

111
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,700
不是我想转走你的
I'm not the one behind the transfer.

112
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,780
你的对头是比我还要高的人物
You're up against much bigger fish than me.

113
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,150
我会安排你们互相再见的
I'll arrange for you to say goodbye.

114
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,500
明天就走吧
You ship out tomorrow.

115
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,300
我打算今晚动手  看看是否能到屋顶
I'm going into the walls,see if I can access the roof.

116
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,080
不想说说转监狱的事么
You going to tell me about the transfer?

117
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,640
-我会处理的  -你会处理
-I'm taking care of it.  -You're taking care of it?

118
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,120
听起来你已经搞定了
Sounds to me like you're reaching.

119
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,150
也许  有些进展
Maybe. A little.

120
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,390
有些进展
A little.

121
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,520
你知道嘛   本来我已经准备接受这一切了
You know, I had made my peace to what was coming.

122
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,200
但你出现了 给了我一样东西
and then you show up and give me the one thing

123
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,090
是我这种人不应该有的东西
a man in my situation shouldn't have.

124
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,460
希望
Hope.

125
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,700
但似乎又要被夺走了
And now that's gonna be taken away.

126
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,320
-别这么想  林肯  -我只有三周的时间了
-Don't do this, Linc.  -I got three weeks.

127
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,880
你想让我怎么样
What do you want me to do?

128
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,640
说阿 迈克尔
Come on, Michael.

129
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,280
你到底想让我做什么
What do you want me to do?

130
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,130
带她回来
Bring her back.

131
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,500
你知道我做不到
You know I can't do that.

132
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,210
听着  有些事情我的确可以做
But, look, there's some stuff that I can do.

133
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,600
虽然一切都不一样了 不过我们会想办法的
It's not gonna be the same,but we're gonna figure it out.

134
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,700
而且  不管发生什么 我们永远在一起
And no matter what,it's still gonna be me and you.

135
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,250
好吧  但如果你出事儿了怎么办
OK, but what if something happens to you?

136
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,610
你只要 相信我就可以了
You just have a little faith.

137
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,710
相信我就可以了
Just have a little faith.

138
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,280
好吧  就算这样
All right, here's the deal.

139
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,080
我们相信林肯 这录影带是伪造的
We believe Lincoln,this tape is a lie.

140
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,960
-肯定是的  -你都看到了  都在这儿了
-It has to be.  -you saw it. It's all there.

141
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,380
恩  也许我们要找的不是这个
Yeah, but, but maybe what we're looking for is what's not there.

142
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,730
好吧  斯蒂德曼
OK. Steadman.

143
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,010
-你瞧 他在看什么  -车 还是什么人
You see, what's he looking at?  -car? A pedestrian?

144
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,630
不  不  不 你看他的视线太高了  不是吗
No,No,No. His eye line is too high, right?

145
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,520
看起来他更像是在看摄像头
It's like he's looking right into the camera.

146
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,470
可能还在说 茄子
Might as well be saying "cheese."

147
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,030
可现在他就坐那儿而已
Now he just sits there.

148
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,330
像这样待了十  十五秒左右  看起来他在...
Like,10, 15 seconds, as if he was...

149
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
等人
{\fn方正综艺简体}{\fs13}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Waiting for someone.

150
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,050
这里
There.

151
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,940
那可是一把九毫米口径的手枪
That's a nine millimetre.

152
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,710
难道不该有点后坐力什么的吗
Shouldn't there be some kind of kick or something?

153
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,550
林肯身体很壮实
Lincoln's pretty strong.

154
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,740
难道壮到可以消除任何后坐力么
Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoil?

155
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,960
假设  你杀了人
Now, you shoot someone,

156
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,610
如果光为了复仇
supposedly for revenge.

157
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,880
你还会花时间返回来
do you take the time to go back in

158
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,710
翻箱倒柜的  还不赶紧离开吗
and hit the glove box? Or get the hell out of there?

159
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,470
他们说他想造成一个抢劫的假象
Feds said he was trying to make it look like a robbery.

160
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,840
看着
Look.

161
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,050
看到林肯离开摄像头的角度没有
Look at Lincoln's angle as he leaves the frame.

162
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,830
远离车的方向走去的
walks away from the car.

163
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
但现在这家伙
Now, this guy,

164
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,860
故意没有让自己的脸被摄像头捕捉到
who conveniently hides his face from the camera

165
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,420
那他为什么还要返回呢  为什么
he comes back in. Why?

166
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,500
正好能解释在他公寓里发现的 那条带血的裤子
To explain the bloody pants they'd already planted in his apartment.

167
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,540
-尼克 这太棒了  -恩
-Nick, this is great.  -Yeah

168
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,060
-我们该去找谁  -现在谁都不找  
-Who shall we go to?  -Nobody.

169
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,470
我是说  从公正的角度看
Yet,I mean,to the unbiased eye,

170
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,210
我们正从死神边缘抢夺时间
we're just backing a horse that died in the gate.

171
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,870
有很多不确定的因素  你知道的
A lot of "what ifs" and conjecture, you know.

172
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,650
我们什么都没有 我们需要证据
We don't have anything. We need some evidence.

173
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,280
瞧  如果  林肯没开那枪
Look, if Lincoln didn't fire this gun,

174
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,680
那一定有个非常专业的人
then somebody with some serious skills went to

175
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,620
伪造了这盘带子来证明他开了那枪
work on this to prove he did.

176
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,290
恩  那我们怎么证明呢
Fine, but how do we prove that?

177
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,150
我认识一个人
I know a guy.

178
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,830
-你认识一个人   -是的  我知道
-You know a guy?  -Yeah, I know a guy.

179
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,970
谢谢
Thanks.

180
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,120
看来我们得再做次讨论
Seems we need to have another powwow.

181
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,350
听说你正在整理你的行李
There's been talk about you packing your bags.

182
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,190
别听信谣言
Don't believe everything you hear.

183
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,720
我哪儿都不会去
I'm not going anywhere.

184
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,720
你知道  我真的很难相信你
You know, I have a really hard time trusting you, fish.

185
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,920
重要的是我们仍然按计划进行着
The important thing is that we stay on schedule.

186
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,240
-英格力士 费兹 或者 博西   -英格力士 费兹 或者 博西
-And English, Fitz and Percy?  -English, Fitz or Percy.

187
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,830
你想知道我会怎么选么
You want to know which one we should take out?

188
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,250
没别的意思 不过我不需要你的建议
all due respect, I don't need opinions.

189
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,790
我得知道答案
I need answers.

190
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,600
记住  监狱长晚上五点离开
Remember, The warden leaves at five tonight,

191
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,790
所以五点零五分之前 我们得拿到钥匙
so by five past five we're going to need that key.

192
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,940
有了钥匙 你怎么能得到答案呢
And how is this key gonna give you the answers?

193
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,520
我会考虑这个问题的
I'll worry about that.

194
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,900
你的问题是拿到钥匙
You,Worry about getting the key.

195
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:20,740
这把钥匙最好能有所值  明白吗
This key better be worth it. Understand?

196
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,190
下午好  斯科菲尔德 先生
Afternoon, Mr Scofield.

197
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,380
我想知道怎么才能不被转移
I need to know if there's any way to block a transfer order.

198
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,710
-至少有五十种方法  -那好
-There's about 50 ways.  -All right.

199
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,470
我要那种最快的
I'll take the quickest.

200
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,940
你写份申请来获取所谓的 临时禁令
You file a motion for what they call an "interlocutory injunction."

201
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,670
-这需要多久   -你能多快写完
-How long does that take?  -How fast can you write?

202
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,820
人们可以声称任何东西都有 可能损害到他们的合法权益
A man can claim almost anything violates his constitutional rights.

203
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,570
像环境问题  过敏反应
There's environmental issues, allergies,

204
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,630
宗教需要等  你可以选个适合你自己的
religious requirements, take your pick.

205
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,250
-如果他们不接受怎么办   -没关系
-What if they don't buy it?  -Don't matter.

206
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,340
法律规定 法院必须接收你的申请
Court's required by law to hear your motion

207
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,830
那样在他们受理之前 你就不允许被转移
Until they do, you can't be transferred.

208
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,330
那帮该死的想把我这把老骨头转走 已经动了十年的心思了
Hell, they've been trying to move my tired, grey behind for ten years.

209
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,100
上帝保佑美国的司法系统
God bless the American legal system.

210
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,940
为什么你那么想留在这儿呢
Why do you want to stay in here so badly?

211
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,860
这儿有我不能丢下的东西
someone here I can't bear to leave behind.

212
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,360
我想我们在某种程度上是一致的
I guess that means we've got something in common.

213
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,010
政府要给 林肯・布伦斯 做次体检
State's requiring a physical for Burrows.

214
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,770
-你听说了吧   -谢谢
-You heard the news? didn't you?  -Thanks.

215
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,170
听说什么
No, what?

216
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,720
-他们是兄弟  -谁
-They're brothers.  -Who?

217
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,100
布伦斯和斯科菲尔德
Burrows and Scofield.

218
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,620
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield?

219
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,940
从监狱长那儿的狱警那里听到的
Heard it from one of the COs over in Gen Pop.

220
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,680
他没跟你提起这事儿么
He didn't say anything to you about it?

221
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,680
没有
No.

222
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,680
恩  离自己的哥哥这么近
Oh. Must be hard to be here so close to your brother

223
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,740
却对此无能为力 他一定很痛苦
and not be able to do anything to help him.

224
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,590
-这是什么东西   -一些厕所读物
-What's this?  -More bathroom reading.

225
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,780
-又是 韦斯特莫兰德 写的   -斯科菲尔德
Westmoreland again?  -Scofield.

226
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,350
他好像不想被转走
He's blocking his transfer.

227
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,360
即便申请被拒绝 至少也得花三十天处理
Even if the motion is denied,it's gonna take 30 days to process.

228
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,280
也就是说
And that means...

229
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,170
好了  我得进去了
All right, I'm going in.

230
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,020
-我需要你的帮助  -你是指在墙里面
-I'm gonna need your help.  -You mean In ?

231
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,430
就现在   我想你该等等
Now? I thought you were waiting till...

232
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,520
我必须确认一下 我怎么才能上到那儿
I need to make sure I know how I'm getting up there

233
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,790
那么到时候 
so when the time comes...

234
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,710
好像你没注意到 所有的灯都亮着
In case you didn't notice, the lights are all on.

235
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,520
我们会被很多人看到的
You've got a live studio audience, fish.

236
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,260
你想搞得众人皆知么
How are you gonna get around that?

237
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,750
我们不是还有衣服要洗吗
Don't we have some laundry to do?

238
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,960
事先声明
Just to be clear,

239
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,220
我可不高兴碰你的内裤
I ain't touching your drawers.

240
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,930
眼睛朝前看
Eyes straight ahead.

241
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,130
别停下
Keep it moving.

242
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,400
别停下  继续走
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

243
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,820
抓住他   抓住他
Get him up. Hit him.

244
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,540
嫩鸡
Fish.

245
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,340
我可应付不过来
I can't deal with that.

246
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,600
嫩鸡 赶快啊
Fish. Come on.

247
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,970
嘿 嫩鸡
Yo, fish.

248
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,360
嫩鸡  你去的时间太长了
Fish, you're taking too long, bro.

249
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,770
这可不行  伙计
This ain't gonna fly.man.

250
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,730
作为波多黎各人
The Ricans,

251
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,230
我们天生就有高血压的  你知道不
we've got genetically higher blood pressure, you know that?

252
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,800
我堂兄  就是因为压力过大才死的
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

253
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,400
好像你说过 是你的堂兄抢了你女朋友吧
Thought you said your cousin was moving in on your girl.

254
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,500
那是另外一个 不过还真谢你的提醒呢  混蛋
That's my other cousin, but thanks for bringing that up, jackass.

255
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,530
听着  有好消息 我知道怎么到屋顶了
Look, the good news is I can get to the roof.

256
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:24,210
-那现在怎么办呢   -现在 就等合适的时机了
-So what happens now?  -Now?It's all about timing.

257
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,470
这可是高技术含量的东西  你知道会是谁做的吗
This is a top-dollar job.Do you know who did it?

258
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,160
不知道 你呢
No. Do you?

259
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,450
能够做出这种活儿的都是魔鬼了  伙计
People who do this kind of work are ghosts, man.

260
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,390
高手背后的高手阿
The guy behind the guy behind the guy,

261
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,290
-你知道我的意思么   -你发现什么吗
-you know what I mean?  -You see anything?

262
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,400
被剪辑过的痕迹 证明这是被伪造的
Definitive cuts? Any place that proves the tape might've been doctored?

263
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,530
做的很漂亮 没有任何痕迹
The thing's clean. No footprints.

264
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,090
我是说  通常  如果你把片子分成几层的话
I mean, usually, you peel a video back a couple of layers

265
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,170
伪造的痕迹就显露出来了  但现在什么你们瞧  都看不出来
and anything bogus comes off.  Now you see it, now you don't.

266
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,260
但这盘带子不同
But not this one.

267
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,280
肯定是处理过的 但很巧妙
It's laced. Ingrained.

268
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,700
-你发现什么了   -没
-You see something?  -No

269
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,380
问题就处在你们的眼睛上 他们正是利用这个欺骗了你
The problem with eyes is they play tricks on you..

270
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,200
但是你的耳朵  它不会欺骗你
But your ears...ears don't lie.

271
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,770
瞧  这是从带子分离出来的音频
Here's the audio track from the tape.

272
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,850
-听起来跟真的一样  是吧   -恩
-Sounds pretty true?  -Yeah.

273
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,340
不过声音是假的 声音不应该这样消失的
But noise is a lie .See, it doesn't just die like that.

274
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,470
应该是逐渐消失 所以声音应该是跳跃性的
Stripped down,those levels should be dancing.

275
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,880
我的意思是 在那种地方的枪声
I  mean, a room that size would give you a..

276
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,010
应该是一种   砰 砰 砰 砰
a... blam, blam, blam, blam. You know?

277
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,030
明白吗    声波应该是逐渐从每个墙上消失
Like, one off each wall, split second after the other.

278
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,250
而你们给的带子上 回声是同时响起的
On yours,the reverb's bouncing at the same time.

279
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,010
-这到底是什么意思   -枪声的声波
-What does that mean?  -The sound of a gunshot.

280
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,410
并不是从案发现场录的
It wasn't recorded in that room.

281
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,990
你能确信么
Would you testify to that?

282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,040
恩  我   不知道 毕竟你们给我的是录制的
Oh, uh, I don't know. The tape's a dupe.

283
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,470
你知道  据我所知 你们都动过带子
You know, for all I know, you guys tampered with it.

284
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,680
听着  如果想让我到法庭作证
Look, you want me to testify in court,

285
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,270
我要得到原始带子才行
I'm gonna need to get my hands on the original.

286
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,510
-过敏反应怎么样了  -你说什么
-How are those allergies?  -Excuse me?

287
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
在你的报告里  你提到了  嗯
In your motion, you cited chronic...

288
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,540
鼻窦炎
Sinusitis.

289
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,440
可这并不属于过敏 事实上  只是一种细菌感染
It's not an allergy, actually.It's a bacterial infection.

290
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,840
从东墙河边飘来的空气
The moist air from the river along the east wall

291
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,330
让我感觉  你知道的
helps keep me, you know...

292
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,210
很好
clear.

293
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,450
我很惊讶
I'm impressed.

294
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,210
你到这儿还不到一周 就变得如此圆滑
Not even a week here and you're working it like an old con.

295
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,190
哦  这方面你比我厉害多了 监狱长大人
Well, you've got one up on me, Warden.

296
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,190
你知道我为什么要写那份申请
You know why I needed to file those motions,

297
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,640
但我很迷惑 为什么你要转移我
but I have no idea why you needed to transfer me.

298
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,490
人流管制  斯科菲尔德 就这样  很简单
Traffic control, Scofield.That's all.

299
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,460
人流控制
Traffic control.

300
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,490
瞧  快到五点了 今天就到这儿了怎么样
It's coming up on five o'clock. What do you say we call it a day?

301
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,740
-恐怕我做不完了 先生  -为什么
-I don't think I can do that.  -Why not?

302
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,010
如果我现在撤 这个会倒下来的
If I let go of this support right now,the whole thing's coming down.

303
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,840
瞧  泰姬陵是用的轴向力
See, the Taj was designed using axial force

304
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,450
一系列沿着一个轴的力
a series of internal forces along the longitudinal axis.

305
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,420
嗯  那要多久呢
Yeah. How much longer?

306
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,190
这就要看什么时候干了
Depends on how long it takes to dry.

307
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,990
如果你要我走 我可以告诉你秘书怎么扶住它
If you need me to leave,I can show your secretary how to hold it.

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,220
好吧  你可以留在这儿直到它干
You can stay till it dries.

309
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,750
门外会有警卫
There'll be a guard waiting outside the door.

310
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,010
你做完了就和 贝克 说一声
Just check in with Becky when you're done

311
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,520
他会安排人送你回去
and she'll have somebody escort you back to your cell.

312
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:31,180
-好的  -还有  嗯  斯科菲尔德
-All right.  -And, Scofield.

313
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,740
很感谢你今天能来
I wanna thank you for showing up today.

314
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,730
如果你不来  我也能理解的
I would've understood it if you didn't.

315
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,150
-我们说定的不是嘛  -嗯
-We had a deal.  -Right.

316
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,960
还是要谢谢你
Still, thanks.

317
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,480
我妻子看到这个会非常喜欢的
My wife is gonna love it.

318
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,780
不客气
You're welcome.

319
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
明天见  先生
See you tomorrow, sir.

320
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,430
晚安  监狱长先生
Good night, Warden.

321
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,660
我们正巧是两个人 又碰巧彼此认识
We'd just happen to be two people who happen to know each other,

322
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,710
一起出现在同一家戏剧院
who happen to show up at the same movie theatre

323
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,240
还是同一个时间
at what happens to be the same time.

324
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,490
是么
That's it.

325
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,990
你知道  从这个角度看上去
You know, from this angle,

326
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,810
你还是和我们刚认识时一样漂亮
you look just as good as you did when we first met.

327
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,270
-这样呢   -更美了
-How about from this one?  -Even better.

328
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,710
是给你那些客人的
Those are for your guests.

329
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
-客人   -不是你的同事吗
-Guests?  -Your associates.

330
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,340
他们说你在开会 所以先在里面等
They said you had a meeting.They're in the den.

331
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,230
晚上好  监狱长先生
Evening, Warden.

332
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,390
我也无能为力了
There's nothing I can do.

333
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,740
我必须按照法律 把那些申请提交法庭
I'm legally obligated to file every properly drafted motion with the court

334
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,330
以便于听证会安排
so a hearing can be scheduled.

335
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,630
要花多长时间
And how long does that take?

336
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,200
至少要一个月 如果不顺利  还有可能更长
A month, maybe two if there's a logjam

337
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,910
很抱歉  不过这不归我管
I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands.

338
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,490
为什么我感觉你好像无所谓的样子
Why do I feel you're not all that disappointed?

339
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,390
我能问个问题吗  监狱长
May I ask you a question, Warden?

340
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,890
只是据我观察而已
More of an observation, really.

341
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,670
我刚看了那张照片  嗯
I was looking at the morgue photos

342
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,350
就是那个男孩的照片   叫 威尔・克雷顿 是吧
from that boy back in Toledo ,Will Clayton

343
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,100
和他爸爸还真像
and, my Lord,if he wasn't the spitting image of his daddy.

344
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,970
感觉就像苹果从很高的树上掉下来  是吧
apple fell real far from the tree with that one, didn't it?

345
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,970
从苹果树上掉下来 血肉模糊
fell off the tree, fell all over the pavement.

346
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,210
你这个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

347
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,070
你的妻子看来原谅你了
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair,

348
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,130
但是应该是最后的底线了吧
Something tells me that's pretty much all the forgiveness she's got left in her bag.

349
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,800
特别是碰到私生子的时候
Especially when it comes to an illegitimate child.

350
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,140
小威尔是怎么了
What happened with young Will,

351
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,320
监狱长先生
Warden?

352
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,580
给我滚出去
Get out of my house.

353
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,300
赶紧处理掉 斯科菲尔德 的申请
Lose Scofield's paperwork.

354
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,270
你们要留下来一起吃晚餐么
You gentlemen staying for dinner?

355
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,250
谢谢了  不过我想我们该走了
Thanks, but I think we're on our way.

356
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,820
朱迪  谢谢你的招待
Judy, it was a real pleasure.

357
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,510
谢谢你
Thank you.

358
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,760
这是我喝到的最好的冰红茶了
And that just may have been the best iced tea I've ever had.

359
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,750
监狱长先生 真的应该好好珍惜现在的一切
Warden, better do everything you can to hold on to this one.

360
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,060
-我会的  -很好
-I will.  -Good.

361
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,900
没事儿吧你
Is everything all right?

362
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,430
嗯  很好  别担心
Oh, yeah. Just fine. honey..

363
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,290
只是有些未做完的工作而已
I just have a little unfinished work to take care of.

364
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,010
我马上出去吃饭
I'll be right in.

365
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,140
好的
OK.

366
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,770
都搞定了
It's all clear.

367
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,650
晚上好  林肯
Evening, Lincoln.

368
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,990
医生  你来啦
Doctor.

369
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,330
我今晚得给你做个体检
I'm supposed to give you a physical this evening.

370
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,560
整个过程可能会比较繁琐
apologize in advance for the heavy dose of irony we're about to participate in.

371
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,320
没关系  你也是例行公事
That's all right. Just doing your job.

372
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,550
嗯  让政府知道你现在很健康
Yeah, well...Letting them know you're healthy enough to execute

373
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,720
不过这可不是我从医的初衷
is not why I went to medical school.

374
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,000
-很抱歉  -没关系
-I apologise.  -It's OK.

375
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,580
好了
All right.

376
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,800
嗯  我得了解下你的家族病史
I'm gonna need a family medical history from you.

377
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,980
看看有没有遗传性的疾病
Any ailments or conditions that are hereditary.

378
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,030
先从你母亲开始吧
start with your mom.

379
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,020
-癌症 肝癌  -好的 你父亲呢
-Cancer. Liver.  -OK. Father?

380
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,090
嗯  我小时候就分开了
Split when I was young.

381
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,630
兄妹呢
Siblings.

382
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,460
除了迈克尔还有别人吗
Anyone besides Michael?

383
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,740
这儿可不大  林肯
Fox River's a small town, Lincoln.

384
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,320
在这儿人们有足够多的时间闲聊
People around here don't have a whole lot to do besides time and talk.

385
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,900
你们关系怎么样  很亲密吧
you close?

386
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,650
以前是的
We were.

387
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,730
-现在呢   -嗯
-How about now?  -Huh?

388
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,520
现在关系怎么样呢
How about now?

389
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,260
他的一生很惨
He has been abandoned his whole life

390
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:45,880
父亲很早就抛弃他  母亲也走了 现在又轮到我
Dad, Mom ,she died young,and now me.

391
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,020
所以就到这儿来了
Think that's why he's here?

392
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,880
是否你的
Cos your

393
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,940
你的死会再次勾起他的回忆
your death would feel like it's happening again

394
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,100
我很早就离开他了
I abandoned him a long time ago.

395
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,200
这就是他为什么会进监狱的原因吧
That's why he's here.

396
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,820
威尔  十岁

397
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,290
关门
Gates closing.

398
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,430
-是时候了  -什么
-It's time.  -Time?

399
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,520
哦  天哪  我们又得忙活开了
Oh, God. Here we go again.

400
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,480
十五分钟后就得点名 你到底想干吗
Count's in 15 minutes. What are you doing?

401
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,610
相信我  知道得越少对你越好
Trust me. The less you know, the better.

402
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,280
我知道的越少  伙计  我可还什么都不知道呢
The less I know? Man,You got me in the dark.

403
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:45,780
这样才好啊
That's exactly where you wanna be.

404
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,530
这个时间很少看到你嘛
Don't normally find you here at this hour.

405
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:59,280
是来忏悔  还是需要神的建议
Are you seeking his forgiveness? Or advice?

406
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,390
我也不清楚  本
I really don't know any more, Ben.

407
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,230
我知道我应该为我儿子的事负责的
All I know is my son Will was my responsibility.

408
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,850
我要是不走 也许他就不会出事儿
If I'd stayed in his life, I could've saved his life.

409
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,720
他的死只是个意外  亨利
His death was an accident, Henry.

410
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,390
虽然他是个罪犯  还吸毒
He was a criminal,and an addict

411
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,240
但他毕竟只有十八岁啊
but he was only 18 years old.

412
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,950
可他母亲说的很清楚 如果想和她在一起
His mother made it clear you couldn't be in his life

413
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,360
你就得离开你儿子
if you weren't gonna be in hers.

414
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,540
你既然选择跟朱迪在一起 你就应该了解这些
When you chose to stay with Judy,you understood that.

415
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,980
我不仅想到了 而且很感激
I not only understood it, I was grateful for it.

416
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,780
我告诉自己
I told myself

417
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:43,470
我尊重了她的意愿
I was respecting her wishes.

418
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,370
虽然我很恨她
I cursed her

419
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,230
但每天我还是感谢上帝
under my breath while every day I thanked God

420
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,290
让我从这件事里面
for allowing me to wash my hands of...

421
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,310
解脱出来
Of Toledo.

422
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,050
为了所有这一切
All of it.

423
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,610
所以  我回到朱迪身边
So I ran home,to Judy,

424
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,690
把秘密埋藏心底
I buried the secret.

425
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,400
但我却连
But I never got a chance to...

426
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,760
亲手埋葬
to bury my...

427
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,810
自己儿子的机会都没有
my son.

428
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,270
我算是什么样的人啊 本
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

429
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:39,120
为了自己的利益就不顾及别人的性命
Sacrifices somebody else's life just to make their own life easier.

430
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,540
你们可以整晚和我争论
You can argue with me all night.

431
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,000
我真的无能为力了
Believe me,I haven't got anything better to do.

432
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:49,390
但我确实不能把作为证据的原始带给你们
But it won't change the fact that I can't just hand out original copies of evidence.

433
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,470
哪怕你就看一眼
If you could just take a look...

434
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,470
哦  你就是有司法部长的签名都不行
Oh, I don't care if your FOIL is signed by the attorney general,

435
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,530
我还是不能给你们
I can't give it to you.

436
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,410
那我们是否可以带人过来 在现场看一下呢
What if we brought somebody here to watch it?

437
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,780
你们可以派人盯着他
Your supervisor could monitor him the entire time.

438
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,970
可以搜身  或者发誓
He'd strip down and swear on a stack of Bibles.

439
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,780
-怎样做都可以  -等等 你们要的文件编号多少
-Whatever it takes.  -Wait, what did you say the docket number was?

440
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:09,010
嗯  是 296-SPE
It's 296-SPE

441
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,750
有什么问题么
What's wrong?

442
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,680
跟我来
Come with me.

443
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,340
昨晚  一根水管爆裂 淹了整间房间
Last night a pipe burst upstairs,flooded the place.

444
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,250
一百多个案子的档案
Files from over 100 cases

445
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,900
可能大部分都没了  包括你们要的
pretty much lost all of them, including yours.

446
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,260
-只冲了这间房子?   -谁说得清呢 灾难
-Just this room?  -Some kind of freak accident.

447
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,160
-点名  -克林汉姆
-Count'em.  -Callahan..

斯科菲尔德
Scofield,

452
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,960
快给我出来
get the hell out here.

453
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,880
有人越狱
We got a runner.

454
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,270
好吧  再问你一遍  小鸡巴
All right. For the last time, pini Ata.

455
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,840
斯科菲尔德 到底到哪儿去了
Where the hell's Scofield?

456
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,600
如果他跑了  你就不会好过  懂不
He's gone, you're gone. You hear me?

457
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,290
取消警报吧  队长
Call it off, Captain.

458
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,640
-我知道斯科菲尔德在哪儿  -哪儿
-I got Scofield right here.  -Where?

459
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,480
在监狱长办公室呢
In the warden's office.

460
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,850
你亲眼看见的
you looking at him?

461
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:56,490
别光泡马子了 到里面去看看
Stop trying to nail the secretary.and check the damn office.

462
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,880
队长  他跑了
Captain, he's gone.

463
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,540
英格力士街

464
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,860
博西街

465
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,650
费兹街

466
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,080
-他不可能就这样蒸发掉的  -明白  先生
-man can'tjust vanish.deputy.  -I know, sir.

467
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,440
-他从来没出来过么   -没有
-He never checked out?  -No.

468
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,430
-那后门呢   -我查过了 锁着呢
-and the rear door?  -It's still locked, sir. I checked.

469
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,700
那他到底是
How the hell did he...?

470
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,380
出什么事儿了
What's going on?

471
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,090
你在这里待的太久了
You're in the warden's office after hours.

472
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,780
我可以现在就杀了你 不用负任何责任
I could kill you and the paperwork wouldn't need more than a date.

473
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:26,120
-告诉我  你究竟在这儿干吗   -好了  行了
-Tell me, what were you doing in here?  -All right, Deputy. That's enough.

474
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,740
胶水还没干呢  是你让我留在这儿的
work wasn't dry.You said to stay until it was.

475
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,770
-你一直待在这儿的么   -是的  先生
-You were in here?  -Yes, sir.

476
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,300
是的  我没看到他出去过
-It's true. I never saw him leave.

477
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,170
可能我没注意他在桌子后面呢
I must not have seen him behind the table.

478
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,250
监狱长  这一切简直太荒唐了
Warden, all due respect, this is ridiculous!

479
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,560
犯人居然不在牢房里
This prisoner was out of his cell.

480
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,510
-还错过了点名  -我知道了 副官
-He missed the count.  -I understand, Deputy.

481
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,280
事实是 现在 斯科菲尔德 已经不再是问题了
thing is,Mr Scofield is not our problem any more.

482
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,160
看起来他的档案出了些问题
Seems there was an error in his paperwork.

483
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,080
马上他就得被转移了
He's gonna be transferred after all.

484
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,270
这不可能
That's not possible.

485
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,190
把犯人押回牢房去
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

486
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,830
狱长  我只需要三周而已
Warden, all I need is three weeks.

487
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,290
-放开我  -嘿  快点
-Get off me!  -Hey, come on, now!

488
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,340
求你了  我只需要一点时间
please. I just need a little time.

489
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,750
就一点点时间而已
Just give me the time.

490
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,370
你觉得那仅仅是个巧合吗
Any chance you want to write this off as a coincidence?

491
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,790
我也不这么认为
Me neither.

492
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,620
他们怎么会知道我们要那盘带子
How could they have known we were coming for the tape?

493
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,680
三小时前 我们还不认识呢
Three hours ago, we didn't even know.

494
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,490
也许  我们得罪人了
Well,We're pissing someone off.

495
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,690
似乎你还很开心
You say that like it's a good thing.

496
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,520
有人在妨碍司法公正 不过我们还得有信心
People start breaking the law,you know you're getting warm.

497
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,940
我们手上还有复制的  也许
We still have our copy of the tape, so maybe...

498
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,330
-尼克  -待这别动
-Nick.  -Stay here.

499
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,840
不知道是谁  已经走了
Whoever it was has gone.

500
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:59,580
-有东西丢了么   -没有
-Does it look like they got anything?  -No.

501
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:08,470
好像什么都没动过
Everything's exactly the way I left it.

502
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,050
怎么啦   怎么啦
What? What?

503
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,750
怎么啦
What?

504
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,880
-带子没了  -你确定吗
-The tape. It's gone.  -Are you sure?

505
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,420
-他们怎么知道   -我们得冷静地想想
-How could they know?-Think this through.

506
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,370
他们怎么知道带子就放在这儿
How could they know exactly where to look?

507
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,430
等等  还有其他人有这儿的钥匙么
Wait. Does anyone else have a key?

508
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,430
-你确定是放这儿的么   -当时你也在啊  记得么
-Are you sure this is where you put it?  -You were here, remember?

509
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,040
我当时跟你说话  然后就走到这儿了
I was talking to you, I walked toward the cabinet,

510
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,890
然后我说
and I said...

511
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,970
怎么了
What?

512
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,340
维罗妮卡
Veronica,

513
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,060
没事儿吧
are you OK?

514
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,520
维罗妮卡
Veronica.

515
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,540
开门
Open up!

516
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,290
早餐时间  都出来
Breakfast, gentlemen. Let's move it.

517
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,460
苏克雷  走吧 斯科菲尔德  你留在这儿
Sucre, let's go. Scofield, wait here.

518
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,130
估计马上就会把你送走
I'm sure your ride'll be along any minute now.

519
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,370
不应该这样
This can't be it.

520
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,750
事情不能就这样结束
It can't end like this.

521
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,020
快点出来
Let's move it.

522
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,230
-费兹街   -什么
-Fitz.  -What?

523
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,360
我们可以从费兹街逃走
We were gonna take Fitz out.

524
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,560
毫无疑问
It was as clear as day.

525
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,220
警察呢  他们多久会到
And the cops? How long did it take them to respond?

526
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,210
你都算过了
You got all the timing down?

527
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,390
我们有足够时间
Think we would've made it?

528
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,380
苏克雷  快点
Sucre, now.

529
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,350
嘿 嫩鸡  你到哪儿去
Hey, fishface, where are you going?

530
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,640
打电话给我妻子  告诉她带着孩子离开这个国家
Call my wife. Tell her to get the kids and get the hell out of the country.

531
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,790
对不起
I'm sorry.

532
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,200
别忘了系安全带
Don't forget to buckle up.

533
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,770
这个犯人在这里干吗啊
What's this prisoner doing out of his cell?

534
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,060
-要被转移  -不 不 不 不
-being transferred.  -No,no,no,no,

535
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,580
肯定有些误会
There must be some kind of a mistake.

536
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,310
他昨天才提交了份申请
This man filed a motion yesterday.

537
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,860
他身体有问题 不适合现在被转送
He has a medical condition which precludes transfer.

538
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:23,620
-鼻窦炎 是吧   -鼻窦炎
-Sinusitis, right?  -Sinusitis.

539
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,270
把他送回牢房去
Take the prisoner back to his cell.

540
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,300
但得扣放风时间 他昨晚没有点名
But yank his rec time. He missed count last night.

541
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,160
回来的好早 你没事儿吧
You're home early. Everything OK?

542
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,610
是啊
Yeah.

543
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,210
恩  没什么
Yeah, it is.

544
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,500
只是  嗯
There's just...

545
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,020
朱迪
Judy,

546
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,880
我要和你说一个人
there's someone I need to tell you about.

547
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,340
喂
Yes?

548
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:44,210
-转监狱没有能够成功    -真令人失望
-The transfer did not go through.   -That's disappointing.

549
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,070
-我们可以再次提出  但那个狱长   -别再浪费时间了
-We can refile, but the warden...   -It's a waste of time.

550
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,500
我想我们别尽做些表面文章了  先生们
I think it's time we stopped beating around the bush,gentlemen,

551
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,040
是时候动手了
and go after the damn bush.

552
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,130
布伦斯
Burrows.

553
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,990
你想让我做什么
What do you want done?

554
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,500
夺走他现在惟一还拥有的东西...时间
Take the only thing Burrows has left...time.

555
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,110
死刑不一定非得通过监狱里的电椅来执行
After all, the chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.

556
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,520
为什么牙膏筒却没事?
how come they can't eat through the tube?
