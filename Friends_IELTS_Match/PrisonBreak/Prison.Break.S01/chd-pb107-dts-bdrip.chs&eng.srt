Constantly coming up here

2
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,500
将阻止我做穿过那堵墙需要做的事
for count won't let me do what I need to do to get through.

3
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,880
不点名的唯一方法是 禁闭
The only way to stop counting is a lockdown.

4
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,750
你需要把这里的人激怒
You'd better get the inmates riled up.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,250
好吧 就这样 禁闭
All right! That's it! Lockdown!

6
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,580
有人打了一个匿名电话
The anonymous caller

7
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,230
不管是谁打的电话他都不可能看见林肯
couldn't have seen Lincoln.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,110
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,350
那个电话来自华盛顿
Because the call came from Washington DC.

10
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,080
我是贝利克 我们这边已经被突破
This is Bellick. Our wing has been breacked.

11
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,810
胡克的弹性定律?
Hooke's Law of elasticity.

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,710
我们在设计好的位置上钻孔
If we drill holes in strategic locations,

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,570
我们将破坏这堵墙的负荷能力
we compromise the wall's load-carrying capacity.

14
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,160
解开手铐
Take the cuffs off.

15
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,180
-一个菜鸟狱警   -滚远点 帝博格

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,880
-我女儿在哪里?  -不用担心 她很好
-Where's my daughter?   -She's fine.

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,700
那里的警卫报告说一切正常
A guard assures us everything is fine.

19
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,530
一切尽在我们的掌控 州长
We have everything under control.

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,250
最好是这样
You'd better hope you do.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,870
他们想越狱
They're breaking out.

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,380
-他们想越狱  -嘘
-They're breaking...  -Shh.

23
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,350
我们需要帮忙
We need a favour.

-是的 土耳其人  -来吧
-Yeah, Turk.  -Come on.

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,210
嘿 大块头就要抓到医生了
Hey, yo! Stroke is about to get the doc.

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,820
苏克雷  我需要你完成我们刚起步的事情
Finish what we started.

29
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,400
谁也不许碰狱警 谁也不准
No one touches the CO. No one.

30
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,890
-政府那边有什么动静吗  -还没有 长官
-Any word from the governor?  -Not yet, boss.

31
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,300
贝利克 让他们排好队
Bellick! Get those guys in line.

32
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,100
叫他们排好队
Get 'em into formation.

33
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,210
-要进去吗  -还不
-Going back in?  -Not yet.

34
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,420
大约一小时前我们切断供水
We cut the water off about an hour ago.

35
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,420
早就让他们渴得受不了了
The stink alone should drive 'em out of there.

36
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,110
你认为那样起作用?
You think that's gonna work?

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,110
不  但这是一定要做的
No, but it's protocol.

38
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,570
我们都要按规矩办事
And we're all gonna do this by the book.

39
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,100
这是我们最好的机会了  但是现在要让他们受点痛

多久我们才能开通冷气

00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,240
我们需要空调
We need the AC.

我们有一名人质 那个新来的警卫

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,710
去查看看他在不在那?

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,660
他们抓到了  鲍勃
They got Bob.

48
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,690
那个女医生  告诉他我们抓了她

51
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,880
-医生?  -仅此一名
-The doctor?  -There's only one.

52
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,030
这么能有这种事情?
How the hell did that happen?

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,940
他们怎么靠近她的
How did they get their hands on her?

54
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,940
我以为她是安全的 她在医务室
I thought she was safe in Sick Bay.

现在我们得马上把她弄出来 有人很快就要到那了

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,230
这不合规矩
It's not by the book.

58
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,510
长官 这里有些情况

我向上帝发誓

69
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,270
我什么都不会说
 I'm not gonna say anything.

70
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,970
-我什么都没看见  -你说的没错
-I didn't see anything.   -That's right, badge.

71
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,560
你什么也看不见
You didn't see nothing.

72
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,530
等一下 别走
Wait. Don't leave.

73
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,480
对不起 我就回来
Sorry. I'll be back.

74
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,540
我为你掩护
Don't worry. I'll cover for you.

75
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,960
别担心 狱警 好吗
Don't worry, CO. All right?

76
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,560
我不会伤害任何人
I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

77
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,540
我现在是队伍的一员
I'm part of the team now.

78
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,180
现在麻烦帮一下
Help a brother out.

79
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,070
把它推好
Drag that over.

80
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,290
就是这样
That's the way. Mm-hm-hm-hm.

81
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,780
先生们女士们请回到座位上 并系好安全带
Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.

82
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,750
我们准备降落
We are making our final approach

83
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,300
华盛顿
into Washington DC.

84
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,280
我们必须关注实质性的问题
We need to focus on the real question.

85
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,520
谁想要特伦斯・斯蒂德曼死掉
Who wanted Terrence Steadman dead?

86
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,440
那个从华盛顿打的电话 它没让你获得什么吗
The call came from DC.What does that tell you?

87
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,730
我觉得除了与政府有关的人
You gotta think past the government.

88
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,850
任何人都有可能 商业伙伴或是竞争者
Anybody could be here.A business partner, a rival.

89
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,260
斯蒂德曼死之前
Before Steadman was killed,

90
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,830
艾克菲尔公司在技术大会上推行了一种新的电力引擎
EcoField introduced a prototype electric engine at the techno conference.

91
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,760
要是那个成了主流 没人再会去买60美圆一桶的原油
$60 barrels of oil would be obsolete if that thing ever hit the mainstream.

92
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,700
可能是石油公司
Could be oil. Oil companies.

93
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,660
供应商 客户 两者之间都有可能
Suppliers, consumers, everything in between.

94
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,880
或是依赖于石油的政府
Or the government of an oil-based economy.

95
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,220
例如美国
Like the United States.

96
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,560
-能让我拿走这个吗?    -当然
-Can I take your soda?  -Sure.

97
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,730
-谢谢  -谢谢
-Thank you.  -Thank you.

98
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,780
降落之后 我需要见我的朋友
At any rate, we land, we meet my guy,

99
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,270
即使我们找不到那个打电话的人
and even if we don't find the person who tipped off the cops,

100
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,060
最好也能从警察那找到这个电话
we find his phone.

101
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,110
然后从纸面上接着找
The paper trail begins.

102
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,030
州长来了
That's the governor.

103
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,160
不管发生什么 啥也别说
Whatever happens, don't say anything.

104
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,180
州长先生 感谢你能来
Governor. Appreciate you coming.

105
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,060
现在我必须告知您 自从我们结束谈话之后 情况又进一步升级
Now you should know,Since our conversation, the situation has escalated.

106
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,330
但是不用担心 我们的进展很顺利
But we're making good progress...

107
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
废话少说 狱长
Just cut the crap, Warden,

108
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,160
告诉我我的女儿在哪
and tell me where my daughter is.

109
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,040
救命!
Help!

110
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,910
救命!
Help!

111
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,610
我们抓到的是  泰勒・罗勃特・汉森
(T-Bag) We got here Tyler Robert Hudson.

112
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,270
真是奇特啊
That is fancy, CO!

113
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,050
看这地址:144号 橡树 公园路...
And look at that address -144 Oak Park...

114
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,650
-这是什么?  -庄园
-What's this?  -Terrace.

115
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,810
庄园
Terrace.

116
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,560
你是怎么搞到的?
How'd you swing that, CO?

117
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,300
听起来你是生活在...
Sounds like you're about something,living on a terrace.

118
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,020
庄园
Terrace.

119
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,340
真想去那玩玩
I can't wait to kick it on a terrace.

120
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,160
什么
What?

121
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,880
-这个一定是你的女儿  -放回去
-This here must be your daughter.  -Put it back.

122
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,800
舞会上?
Prom?

123
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,990
你知道人们对于舞会上的衣服是怎么看的 对不?
You know what they say about a prom dress, don't you?

124
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,700
她那晚没回家 对吗?
She didn't come home that night, did she?

125
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:40,720
不 她整晚都穿着它
No, she wore that all night long.

126
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,380
第二天早上还要把那身服装丢进汽车旅馆之后的垃圾箱 
Next morning she had to throw that dress in the trash can behind the motel

127
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,350
这样她妈妈就看不到...
so her momma didn't see...

128
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,450
你他妈在做什么
What the hell are you doing?

129
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:58,200
我只是和他在闲聊女儿 你知道...谈论女人
I'm just kicking with Deputy Dawg. Talking women.

130
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:06,120
我很清楚这里的情况  我们面对的是一个不一般的人
I'll be very clear here,because you and I face an evolutionary gap.

131
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,380
你不许动他一根寒毛
You ain't gonna hurt this man.

132
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,430
我们都身陷其中了知道吗
We're locked into this thing now.Understand?

133
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,410
他是我们唯一的筹码
And he's the only leverage we have.

134
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,310
-谢谢  -不用
-Thank you.  -You're welcome.

135
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,780
现在 你明白了没
Now, do we have an understanding?

136
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,320
现在我们是一边的了 知道吗
I'm on your side now. You understand me?

137
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,970
我出去看看
I'm just going with the flow.

138
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:43,360
你解决了你的...筹码后在告诉我
You let me know when you're done with your "leverage".

139
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,010
让我出去
Let me out!

140
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,060
让烟把这娘们熏出来
Let's smoke the bitch out!

141
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,510
噢 不 不
Oh,no no

142
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,500
我不会让你弄得很痛
It ain't gonna hurt real bad

143
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,940
只要你能配合
if you make it easy.

144
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,850
但是你要敢抵抗...
If you make it hard, though...

145
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,510

噢 怎么样

305
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,440
这些囚犯没有浪费时间 我们的狱警必须强硬起来
These inmates don't mess around.Us COs need to get tough.

306

狱长是个好人
Warden Pope's a good guy,

307
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,280
但是他有时候不明白
but he doesn't understand

308
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,350
得使用强硬手段控制住局势
that you gotta grab the situation by the gonads and take control.

309
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,100
你就会这么来做对不

-我不知道  -给我

314
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,480
一家人要一起做破坏
Demolition runs in the family.

315
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,450
诀窍就是压迫
The whole trick is pressure.

316
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,680
-我该从哪里...这里?  -是的
-Where should I...?  -Here?

317
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,940
好的好的
Good.Good.

318
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,250
是这样 你要用力推 但不能太用力

319
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,410
就象你什么的时候 你知道

320

你得小心点
But you gotta be careful.

00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,580
-我知道  -不 我意思是

你...你一不小心就会碰到煤气管道

煤气...管道
Gas pipe?

324
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:29,660
你知道 管道里是煤气
Yeah, you know,as in pipe that carries the gas.

325
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,360
我们不能走这里
We can't go this way.

326
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,030
必须走这里 没别的路去探访室了

327
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,000
-就是这样  -不　不是这样

328
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,170
-从这往回走  -没用
-It's back this way.  -This won't help.

329
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,900
-相信我  -迈克尔 如果你错了
-Trust me.  -If you're wrong...

330
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:54,390
我们没多少时间
We don't have time.

331
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,060
不要太用力 不要...太轻
Not too hard. Not too soft.

332
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,480
我是她这么大的时候 身上长了不少坏东西
When I was her age, I had such bad skin.

333
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,440
他们叫它痤疮
Acne, they called it.

334
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,210
她看起来就象那些嘲笑我的女孩一样
She looks just like all them girls that made fun of me.

335
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,870
我杀掉你之后
After I kill you,

336
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,520
我爬出这个洞 叫一辆豪华轿车
I'm gonna crawl out that hole and call me up a limousine

337
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:32,230
我和你的宝贝女儿一同去舞会

338
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,670
有没有莎拉的新消息
What's the news with Sara?

339
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,860

-你们还不知道她在哪里?  -我们正在找
-You don't even know where she is?  -We're on it.

341
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,270
一旦我们找到她马上告诉你
Once we do, we'll let you know.

342
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,930
你早就该听贝利克队长的话封锁整个区域
You should listen to Captain Bellick and gas the whole block.

343
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,460
贝利克队长?
Captain Bellick?

344
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,270
他处在一线工作 他知道这些人会做什么
He knows what these guys can do.

345
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,360
你最好祈祷莎拉能完好的出来
You'd better pray that Sara gets out in one piece.

346

我会的 州长 但这还是我的监狱

但我不留下你

你别无选择 我是一个坏人 不记得了?

回到房间  不插手任何事情
Go back to my cell. Stay out of the way.

366

在一个区域的通风口

P.I不会有人去那里
PI didn't go there.

我们也从不派犯人去那里
We'd never assign inmates to do that.
