1
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,670
好了
That's it.

2
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,500
能不能再让我欣赏一会儿
Can I just, you know,look at it for a minute?

3
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,610
你真是个艺术家 希德
You're an artist, Sid.

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,200
你是说 你就这么走了 然后我再也见不到这件艺术品了
You're telling me you're gonna walk outta here and I'm never gonna see it again?

5
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,180
很大的可能性 是的
There's a good chance of that, yes.

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,700
大多数人第一次 都会选择从小的图案纹起
Most guys, for the first one, they start with something small.

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,750
妈妈或是女朋友 的姓名缩写什么的
"Mom", girlfriend's initials,something like that.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,020
而你却不同
Not you.

9
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,660
短短的两个月 就做了整整一套
You get a full set of sleeves all in a couple of months.

10
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,020
要是别人的话 可能要做好几年呢
It takes guys a few years to get the ink you got.

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,600
我可没那么多时间
I don't have a few years.

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,860
我也希望我有啊
Wish to hell I did.

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,840
把保险柜打开
The vault. Open it.

14
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,450
我们打不开 分行经理不在
We can't. The branch manager's not here.

15
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,180
他在哪儿
Where is he?

16
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,420
现在是午餐时间 他在白城堡
It's lunchtime. He's at White Castle.

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,220
什么白城堡
White Castle?

18
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,020
是个快餐店
A fast-food restaurant.

19
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,780
他们有那种小的方形汉堡
They serve those little square burgers.

20
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,260
我知道了
I know what it is.

21
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,190
别以为我在跟你闹着玩 快点儿
I'm not playing games. Open it.

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,830
先生 你包里已经有五十万现金了
Sir, you have half a million dollars cash in your bag.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,440
你再考虑一下 如果
Don't you think it'd be better if...?

24
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,510
我们是警察 你已经被包围了
This is the police. You are completely surrounded.

25
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,370
把枪放下
Put down your weapon.

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,560
把枪放下 快点
Put down your weapons now!

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,000
在我所遇到的持枪抢劫案中从未见过被告完全不替自己辩护的
Rarely in the case of armed robbery do we hear a plea of no contest.

28
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,200
你真的不想辩护么 斯科菲尔德先生
Are you sure about this, Mr Scofield?

29
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,460
是的 法官大人
I'm sure, Your Honour.

30
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,010
法官大人 我请求休庭
Your Honour, we'd like to recess if we could.

31
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,450
我的当事人现在有些神志不清
My client's a bit confused at the moment.

32
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,800
-我很清醒   -法官大人 他不清醒
-I'm not.  -He is, Your Honour.

33
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,760
或许你应该听取一下你律师的提议
Perhaps you should heed her advice.

34
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,530
再用多一点的时间 去考虑你的回答
Take additional time to consider your response.

35
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,100
我考虑好了 法官大人
I've already done that, Your Honour.

36
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,970
我会在办公室决定如何判刑的
I'll retire to my chambers to determine sentencing.

37
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,070
现在休庭 下午一点半继续开庭
Court's recessed until 1:30.

38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,810
我们走吧
Hey, come on. Let's go.

39
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,100
迈克叔叔
Uncle Mike?

40
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,640
我不想让你来
I didn't want you to come.

41
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,470
回家去吧 LJ.
Go home, LJ.

42
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,860
我不想让你看到我这样
I didn't want you to see this.

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,220
他一时肯定会接受不了的
He won't take this well.

44
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,110
这又能怪谁呢 他是你侄子
Can you blame him? He's your nephew.

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,880
他会认为任何与他有联系的人都会进监狱
He's beginning to think anybody he attaches himself to is gonna end up in prison.

46
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,230
并且他不是唯一一个这么认为的 迈克尔
And he's not the only one who's starting to feel that way, Michael.

47
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,370
能给我们一些时间吗
Will you give us a minute?

48
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,110
就一分钟
One minute.

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,000
你难道还不明白么
Don't you understand?

50
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,760
你完全放弃了你所有的权利
You just put the book in that woman's hand.

51
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,940
那个女法官会毫不留情地判你的刑
She's gonna lob it at you like a grenade.

52
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,320
审判和惩罚对她来说是一回事
Justice and punishment are the same thing to her.

53
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,640
我知道
I know.

54
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,210
告诉我你到底在想什么
then will you please tell me what's going through your head.

55
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,390
我们已经谈过了
We've been over this.

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,770
我一直都很了解你
I've known you all my life.

57
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,140
你根本不是一个有暴力倾向的人
You don't have a violent bone in your body.

58
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,030
况且你也不缺钱花
And I know you didn't need the money.

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,980
维罗妮卡
Veronica...

60
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,900
你为什么不让我来帮你呢
Why won't you let me help you?

61
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,940
你已经对我很好了 真的 你一向如此
You've been good to me my whole life.

62
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,760
但这次让我来处理此事 好吗
But you gotta let me deal with this. OK?

63
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,060
鉴于你没有前科 这次抢银行是初犯
Given your lack of prior criminal conduct

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,630
我很想给你减刑
I am inclined toward probation.

65
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,830
但是 事实证明你使用了有致命杀伤力的武器
However,the fact that you discharged a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,480
说明你是蓄意犯罪
suggests malice to me.

67
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,520
以此为据
For that reason

68
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,560
我将判你入狱服刑 斯科菲尔德先生
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr Scofield.

69
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,830
你提出想被关押在芝加哥
It says here that you've requested to be incarcerated

70
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,320
你家附近的监狱
somewhere near your home here in Chicago.

71
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,930
我很愿意这样做
I'm willing to honour that.

72
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,020
离那里最近的一级监狱
The closest level one facility to...

73
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,130
一级监狱?
Level one?

74
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,630
那可是戒备最森严的监狱 法官大人
That's maximum security. Your Honor.

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,390
辩护律师请不要打断我
I would ask counsel to refrain from interrupting me.

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,760
正如我所说
As I was saying

77
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,620
离那最近的一级监狱是 狐狸河 州立监狱
the closest level one facility would be Fox River State Penitentiary.

78
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,670
至于你的刑期 将会是五年
As for your sentence,I'm setting it at five years.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,430
刑期满一半时可以申请假释
You'll be eligible for parole in half that time.

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,250
审判结果即刻生效
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

81
00:05:15,270 --> 00:00:00,000
伊利诺伊州 芝加哥郊区 狐狸河州立监狱

82
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,730
都听好了 一个一个的进来接受检查
All right, people, step inside the door and check yourself for bugs.

83
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,580
听到敲门声就进来 随着队伍向前移动
When you hear the knock, step out. Keep the line moving.

84
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,350
我们不可能把一天的时间都浪费在你们身上
We ain't got all day to get this done.

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,260
排队的时候 不准出声
No more talking in line.

86
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,280
动作快点 你们还有不到5分钟的时间去洗澡
Move it. You got less than five minutes to take a shower.

87
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,820
都动起来 快点 快往前走
Keep that line moving.Keep it moving.Move it. Right now.

88
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,380
快点 抓紧时间
Let's go. Move, move.

89
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,640
下一位躺在板凳上 穿上衣服 快点走
Next down in the banks, dress. Let's go

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,670
姓名和号码

00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,730
斯科菲尔德・迈克尔 94941
Scofield Michael. 94941

92
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,820
你是教徒吗 斯科菲尔德
Are you a religious man, Scofield?

93
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,150
从来就没想过
Never thought about it

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,070
很好 十戒在这里一文不值
Good,cos the Ten Commandments don't mean a box of piss in here.

95
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,440
这里只有两戒
We got two commandments and two only.

96
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,720
第一条戒律是你在这里毫无希望可言
The first commandment is,you got nothin' comin'.

97
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,000
第二戒呢
What's the second commandment?

98
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,360
参考第一条戒律
See commandment number one.

99
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,070
明白了
Gotcha.

100
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,950
你说话绕弯子么
You talking out the side of your neck?

101
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,440
什么
Come again?

102
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,390
你想自作聪明吗
I said, are you bein' a smartass?

103
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,770
只想保持低调 不想引起注意 长官
Just trying to fly low, avoid the radar, boss.

104
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,830
等到刑满释放
Do my time and get out.

105
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,680
在我的地方谁也别想耍花样
There isn't any flyin' under my radar.

106
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,680
我了解了
Good to know.

107
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,590
嗨 长官 能不能找位兄弟上来装台空调
Hey,can a brother get some air conditioning up here,coach?

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,850
这里比吸毒妓女的热吻还要热
It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth,man.

109
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,360
让空调去见鬼吧 我要吸毒的妓女
To hell with the AC, man.Give me the crack ho.

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,450
快点
Come on!

111
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,600
你 小嫩鸡 看什么看
You, fish. What you lookin' at?

112
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,400
没事跑这里来干嘛
You look kinda pretty to be up in here, man.

113
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,260
小嫩鸡
Fish!

114
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,980
我建议你还是坐会吧 小嫩鸡
I suggest you take a seat, fish.

115
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,900
既然来了就好好服刑吧
Ain't nothing to do up in here but serve time.

116
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,260
没人会替你服刑的
Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you!

117
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,300
欢迎来到监狱乐园 小嫩鸡
Welcome to Prisneyland, fish.

118
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,020
你想谈一下吗
You wanna talk about it?

119
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,680
没有什么可谈的
It's not worth talking about.

120
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,770
要是让你一直睡不着觉的话 当然有的
If it's keeping you up, it is.

121
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,390
哦 只不过
No, it's just...

122
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,010
其实也没什么
It's nothing, you know.

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,760
是迈克尔的案子
Michael's case.

124
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,480
你已经尽力了
You did the best you could.

125
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,650
但他却没有
But he didn't.

126
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,730
他只想草草了事 没有任何争辩
He just sort of rolled over,he didn't put up a fight.

127
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,020
真的太不像他了
It's not like him. I...

128
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,490
对不起 我不应该提他的
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about him.

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,980
嗨 这如果是你想的 就是你想的 不是吗
Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind,right?

130
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,610
晚安
Good night.

131
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,280
所有狱警待命
All wings, guard coming out.

132
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,000
所有狱警待命
All wings, guard coming out.

133
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,850

其他的地方由狱警掌管
The C.O.s got the rest.

137
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,550
我告诉你
I'm telling you,

138
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,440
狱警都是世界上最肮脏的流氓
the guards are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

139
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,140
他们与我们唯一的不同
The only difference between us and them

140
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,850
就是他们有徽章
is the badge.

141
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,120
抱着宠物的那个人是谁
Who's the pet lover?

142
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,070
他一直不肯承认 他是 D.B. 库珀
He'll deny it, but he's DB Cooper.

143
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,060
三十年前带着一百五十万现金从一架飞机空降
Parachuted out of a plane 30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.

144
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,580
看起来不像啊
Doesn't look like the type.

145
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,780
谁看起来像呢
Who does?

146
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,020
嗨! 怎么样 百货商店 你还好吗
Hey! What up, Wholesale? You OK?

147
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,030
非常不错
Gonna be greater later.

你再把我的事抖出来

154
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,030

155
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,730
你有这本事么
Man,you couldn't bust a grape in Napa with a set of cleats on.

156
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,910
你再说些什么 朋友 你想找麻烦是么
What are you talkin'about? Man, you want to bump your gums.

00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,240
我想找个人
I'm looking for someone.

159
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,420
他叫林肯・布伦斯

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,940
水缸 林克

他要是想找你麻烦 你可就死定了 小白脸
As in,he'll come at you with everything but the kitchen, snowflake.

164
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,380
在哪儿能找到他
Where can I find him?

165
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,220
这人谋杀了副总统的哥哥
Man killed the VP's brother.

166
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,850
一个月后 他就要坐电椅了
and in a month he's getting the chair.

167
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,100
这里没人比他更危险了
Which means no one up this river is more dangerous than him

168
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,020
谁能把他怎样 杀他两次么
What are they gonna do, kill him twice?

169
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,880
有没有办法让我接近他
There a way I can get to him?

170
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,000
不太可能 他们只有在做礼拜和P.I.的时候才出来
oh,no,The only time those boys get out is for chapel and P.I.

171
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,790
-P.I.是什么   -监狱工厂
-PI? What's that?   -Prison industry.

172
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,840
他们都要去干活
The guys that get along, get to work

173
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,250
刷油漆 刮刮墙 还有做床垫

174
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,060
小嫩鸡 如果我是你的话 才不会感到兴奋
I wouldn't get excited if I were you, fish.

175
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,750
你连监狱工厂的味都闻不着
You ain't sniffin' none of P.I.

176
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,980
为什么
Why's that?

177
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,690
因为工厂由约翰・阿布鲁奇掌控
Cos John Abruzzi runs it.

178
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,320
约翰・阿布鲁奇 约翰・阿布鲁奇

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,630
约翰.阿布鲁奇 约翰.阿布鲁奇
John Abruzzi John Abruzzi

180
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,930
你为什么这么想见布伦斯
Why do you want to see Burrows so bad anyhow?

181
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,160
因为他是我哥哥
Because he's my brother.

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,780
-他们驳回了上诉  -那就再上诉
-They denied the motion.   -Then do it again.

183
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,500
不行 就这样了
I can't. That's it.

184
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,500
五月十一日就是那天
May 11th. That's the date, man.

185
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,160
就是我被执行死刑的日子
That's the date they, uh, you know...execute me.

186
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,880
我知道
I know.

187
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,130
迈克尔 那人不是我杀的
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

188
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,740
可他们有证据
The evidence says you did.

189
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,640
我才不管什么证据 反正我没杀人
I don't care what the evidence says. I didn't kill him.

190
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,980
向我发誓
Swear to me.

191
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,740
我向你发誓 迈克尔
I swear to you, Michael.

192
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,570
那么 他们 怎么会搞错呢
But how did they get it wrong, then?

193
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,950
法庭 上诉
The courts, the appeals...

194
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,510
不知道 我也不知道
Don't know. Don't know.

195
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,180
现在回想起来 我是被陷害的
I keep thinking, looking back on it,is I was set up.

196
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,120
不管是谁要陷害我
And whoever it was that set me up

197
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,900
都想把我尽快至于死地
wants me in the ground as quickly as possible.

198
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,350
表达爱意 还有其他什么词儿呢?
What's another word for "love"?

199
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,700
什么情况下说的
What's the context?

200
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,070
哦  就好像
Oh, you know.

201
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,250
我很爱你
The "I love you so much

202
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,410
再也不去酒馆胡闹 之类的
I ain't never knockin' over a liquor store again" context.

203
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,910
还有 不用太华丽
Except, you know, classy.

204
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,820
嗯
Mm.

205
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,110
我就是想向女朋友求婚
I'm proposing to my girl, if you gotta know.

206
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,970
在信里 
In a letter?

207
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,930
你有更好的方法
You got a better way?

208
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,960
当面说效果会更好
Face to face works pretty good.

209
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,190
这可不是什么浪漫之地
This place ain't exactly the romantic spot.

210
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
我要让她乘着史泰登岛渡轮
I'm gonna have her go get on the Staten Island Ferry

211
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,800
然后当她看到了帝国大厦
then once she can see the Empire State Building

212
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,270
这时她打开信
she opens the letter...

213
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,660
我就差不多成功了
It's like almost being there

214
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,190
但事实上 我根本做不到这一切
Except for the fact that I won't be there.

215
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,770
用 爱恋 试试
Try "passion".

216
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,170
哦 哦 爱恋 爱恋 这个词好 爱恋
Ooh! Ooh! "Passion. Passion" That's dope. Passion

217
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,610
怎么拼的 p-a-s-h
How do you spell that? Is it P-A-S-H...?

218
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,630
没有 h
No H?

219
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,420
LJ 等一下 等一下
LJ, hold up. Hold up?

220
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,760
我想 我办不到
I don't think I can go through with this.

221
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,920
不会有事的 相信我
Everything's gonna be fine. Trust me.

222
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,870
-我们彼此了解 对吧   -是的
-We understand each other,then?  -yeah

223
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,000
是星期五 不是星期六 也不是星期日 是星期五
Friday. Not Saturday, not Sunday. Friday.

224
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,370
完全明白

面额是百元 五元 还有一元的 都不要
I don't want 100s,I don't want fives, I don't want ones.

226
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,520
明白 明白
I know, I know.

227
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,330
只要十元和二十元的
Tens and 20s only.

228
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,950
开始行动
It's on.

229
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,630
警察
Police!

230
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,040
阿布鲁奇  我想让你雇我去监狱工厂
Abruzzi. I need you to hire me at P.I.

231
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,610
爬开
Beat it.

232
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,600
或许你该听听我要说的
Maybe you oughta hear what I gotta say.

233
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,790
你没有我要的东西
You got nothing I need.

234
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,930
我可不这么认为
Wouldn't be too sure of that.

235
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,540
是我错了
My mistake.

236
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,460
我想要的就是一只鸭子
Just what I need. A duck.

237
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,200
监狱工厂  阿布鲁奇
a P.I, Abruzzi.

238
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,770
说不定我能帮上你大忙呢
You might find I can be of more assistance than you think.

239
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,570
再考虑一下
Mull it over.

240
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,600
想好了就来找我谈
Come find me when you're ready to talk.

241
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,320
伙计们 都利索点
All right, guys. Pick it up.

242
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,980
我今晚还想回家呢!

说吧 什么事
Yeah. So?

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,220
就是这个狗样娘的家伙指证阿布鲁奇的
That's the son of a bitch at fingered Abruzzi.

246
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,900
菲波纳奇
That's Fibonacci?

247
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,240
还以这个混蛋会永远消失呢
I thought that punk was gone forever.

248
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,170
很明显  有人找到了他
Evidently somebody found him.

249
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,350
看来有人想和我们玩游戏
somebody messin' with us?

250
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,790
这个你肯定不信
This you're not gonna believe.

251
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,620
这是什么
What is it?

252
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,500
纹身看上去像新的
Tattoo looks fresh.

253
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,500
按住
Hold that.

254
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,770
看来糖尿病患者 还真不介意打针
I guess being a diabetic,you don't mind needles.

255
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,490
我叫迈克尔
I'm Michael, by the way.

256
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,980
斯科菲尔德 我看了你的资料
Scofield. I read your report.

257
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,270
那么你是
And you are?

258

叫我 唐克雷蒂 医生就行
Dr. Tancredi will do.

259
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,970
和州长同姓唐克雷蒂?
"Tancredi" like the governor?

260
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,210
你们不会是亲戚吧
You're not related, are you?

261
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,930
真想不到州长的女儿会在监狱里工作
Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.

262
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,880
而且还是 医生
As a doctor, no less.

263
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,060
我喜欢解决问题 而不是制造问题
I believe in being part of the solution,not the problem.Hm.

264
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,540
通过改变自身来适应万变的世界
"Be the change you want to see in the world."

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,670
怎么了
What?

266
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,110
没什么 只不过这是我的座右铭
Nothing. That was just my senior quote.

267
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,430
原来是你说的
That was you?

268
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,280
我一直认为是甘地说的
This whole time I was thinking it was Gandhi.

269
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,070
你很有意思
You're very funny.

270
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,150
坐好了
Sit tight.

271
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,300
手按住 我马上回来
Put direct pressure on that. I'll be back in a sec.

272
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,700
那么 我们怎么来治疗呢
So, how do we play this?

273
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,690
你给我开几个星期的药吧
You hook me up with a few weeks' supply?

274
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,540
想的美
Nice try.

275
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,450
这里不允许有瘾君子的
No hypos on the floor.

276
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,560
我是不会吸毒的 相信我
I'm the farthest thing from a junkie.Trust me.

277
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,510
我告诉你  迈克尔
I got news for you,Michael.

278
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,510
信任这东西 在监狱里一钱不值
"Trust me" means absolutely zero inside those walls.

279
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,210
你接受胰岛素的途径 就是必须经由我允许
The only way you're getting that insulin is if I'm administering it.

280
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,910
以后我们还会见面的 是么
Guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other,then,huh?

281
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,770
我想是的
I guess so.

282
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,140
布伦斯 的死刑一切就绪了
We're all clear on the Burrows execution

283
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,860
很好
Good

284
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,050
还有件事
Except for one thing

285
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,090
马克莫拉主教不同意这么做
Bishop McMorrow is not in the fold.

286
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,600
他和州长关系不错
He's got a lot of influence with the governor.

287
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,510
他们以前是校友
They went to prep school together apparently.

288
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,890
时间越近
Look, the closer it gets,

289
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,360
我就越担心
the more I'm worried that the bottom

290
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,460
总怕会出什么乱子
is gonna fall out of this whole thing.

291
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,620
去安排我和主教大人见一次面
Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit with the good bishop, then.

292
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,500
记住 再有一个月
Look, in one month

293
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,620
一切都会结束
 it'll all be over.

294
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,940
人子必须被交在罪人手里(选自圣经 路加福音 第24章)
"The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men

295
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,590
被钉在十字架上
and be crucified,

296
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,970
第三日复活
and the third day rise again."

297
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,850
他们记住了他的话 你们也应该那样做
And they remembered his words. And so should you.

298
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,840
今天就到这里吧 愿上帝与你们同在

迈克尔
Michael?

300
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,100
这是怎么回事
Why?

301
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,030
我要把你弄出去
I'm getting you out of here.

302
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,180
布伦斯 快点 快乐时光结束了
Burrows! Roll it up. Happy hour's over.

303
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,710
根本不可能
It's impossible.

304
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,730
除非监狱是你自己设计的
Not if you designed the place it isn't.

305
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
太正式了
Too formal.

306
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,530
太贺卡样了
Too greeting-card.

307
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,420
这事迟早要决定的
We gotta make a decision sooner or later, you know.

308
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,390
还有时间的啊
We have time.

309
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,590
实际上 没有了
We don't, actually.

310
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,060
有些时候 事情还是抓紧点的好
I mean, at some point, we gotta pull the trigger on this thing.

311
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,870
我不想这么草率
I don't wanna rush this.

312
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,940
人生只有一次 我不想出任何差错
We're only gonna do it once. We have to get it right.

313
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,530
亲爱的 能问你个问题么
Honey, can I ask you something?

314
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,350
当然了
Of course.

315
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,170
你是不是要把(婚礼)推迟
Are you putting this off?

316
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,480
你说什么啊
What do you mean?

317
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,860
我是说你是不是改变主意了
I mean, are you having second thoughts?

318
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,940
不 亲爱的 从来没有
No. Honey,no

319
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,750
我没有
I'm not.

320
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,060
我也不知道
I don't know.

321
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,680
只是我禁不住不去想它
I just can't help thinking this is about...

322
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,930
不是这样的
It's not.

323
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,370
我爱你
I love you.

324
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,560
我要成为你的妻子
And I wanna be your wife.

325
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,550
爱恋 你是怎么想的阿
"Passion"? What were you thinking?

326
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,860
你自己也同意的
Hey, you went for it.

327
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,040
她很可能认为我在这里变得娘娘腔了
She probably thinks I went sissy up in here.

328
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:56,320
爱恋 多了一个字 话就变罗索了
"Passion".Got more than one syllable, too much talking.

329
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,460
从现在开始
That's me from now on.

330
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,640
以后只用单音节的词
One-Syllable Sucre.

331
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,510
是 否 爱 恨 爱
"Yes","no","love","hate"..."love".

332
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,930
-不要着急  -你开什么玩笑
-Give it time.  - Are you kidding?

333
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,630
我在向她求婚
I proposed to her

334
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,210
又不需要太多的时间 是 还是 不 一个字而已
That doesn't take time.Si or no. One syllable,man.

335
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,860
她都是周二来探监的
She's supposed to come around for a conjugal on Tuesday.

336
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,330
来之前她总是先打个电话的
She's always calling me beforehand,letting me know she's coming.

337
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,910
可是这次 音信全无
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

338
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,360
是你把她吓跑了
You spooked her.

339
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,670
斯科菲尔德快起来 典狱长要见你
Scofield. Get it together. Pope wants to see you.

340
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,780
这可不妙 小嫩鸡
No good, fish.

341
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,980
从未有人见过典狱长
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

342
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,300
除非他对你的所作所为感兴趣
Not unless he's real interested in what you got going on.

343
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,000
芝加哥大学的高才生
Top of your class at Loyola.

344
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,770
还成绩优秀
Magna cum laude, in fact.

345
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,020
真不敢想象像你这么有资历的人
I can't help wondering what someone with your credentials

346
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,600
竟然会来到这种地方
is doing in a place like this.

347
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,070
我想可能是几个月前走错路了
Took a wrong turn a few months back, I guess.

348
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,130
听你说起来就像是交通违规一样
You make it sound like a traffic infraction,

349
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,090
蹲监狱与单行道上逆向行车 是两码事
Like all you did was turn the wrong way up a one-way street.

350
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,970
谁都有犯错误的时候
Everyone turns up one sooner or later.

351
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,270
我叫你来的原因是
The reason I called you here,

352
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,320
我看了你的档案 在职业一栏里
I noticed in your l-file, under "Occupation",

353
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,200
你写的 无业
you put down "unemployed".

354
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,770
那不是真的 对么
That's not true, now,is it?

355
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,990
斯科菲尔德 我知道你是个结构学工程师
I know you're a structural engineer, Scofield.

356
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,480
沙伽罕建造了泰姬陵
Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal

357
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,520
以此来表达他对妻子爱的永恒
as a monument to his undying love for his wife.

358
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,400
我老婆很喜欢这个故事
My wife is quite fond of the story.

359
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,260
她认为非常浪漫
It appeals to the romantic in her.

360
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,890
嫁给了一个像我这样工作的人
Being married to someone in corrections,

361
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,330
是一件恐怖的事
terrible job.

362
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,410
谁会愿意呢
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

363
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,610
但在这三十九年里我老婆从没有抱怨过
And yet, in 39 years, my wife has never complained.

364
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,910
更遗憾的是 我从未感谢过她
And the worst part of it is,I've never thanked her.

365
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,020
因为我说不出口
So, because I couldn't say it,

366
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,870
我想做一个
I thought, you know, I could build it.

367
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,150
这个六月就是我们结婚40周年纪念日
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

368
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,270
但是这里  你看
But here, look...

369
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,170
你看  问题是
You see, the problem is,

370
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,010
我造得越多
I build anymore,

371
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,180
它就会像空中楼阁一样塌下来
it's all gonna come down like a house of cards.

372
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,220
我想你能帮助我一下
That's where I was hoping you could be of assistance.

373
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,200
作为回报 你每周可以在这里工作三天
for the favour,I can offer you three days of work a week in here

374
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,970
也就不必去什么操场了
and it'll keep you off the yard.

375
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,320
我做不了
I can't do it.

376
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,690
孩子 我敢肯定 在这里让我欠你人情要比你欠我的好
Son,it's better for me to owe you one in here than it is for you to owe me one,

377
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,660
我会考虑的
I'll take my chances.

378
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,590
咱们没什么好谈的了
Then we're through here.

379
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,640
警卫
Guard!

380
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,390
两磅的大麻
Two pounds of pot?

381
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,710
你想干什么  留下案底么
What were you trying to do, set a record?

382
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,360
一点都不好笑 LJ 你很可能会进监狱的
It's not funny, LJ. You could be going to jail.

383
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,670
看来需要人来好好教教你
It's pretty obvious to me you need some guidance.

384
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,380
嗨
Hey.

385
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,890
谢谢
Thanks.

386
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,810
找谁来合适呢 沃布客斯 老爸吗
From who? Old Daddy Warbucks?

387
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,560
给他个机会 他是一个好人
Give him a chance. He's a good man.

388
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,640
我们没有共同语言
We got nothing in common.

389
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,010
你到底是怎么了 LJ
Where's this coming from, LJ?

390
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,930
上学期你几乎全是A 可现在
Last semester you were getting almost all As, and now...

391
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,990
是你父亲 对不
It's your father, isn't it?

392
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,360
我没有父亲
I don't have a father.

393
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,150
你这么做可不明智 相信我
It wasn't an immaculate conception, honey. Trust me.

394
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,380
也许你应该去看看他了
Maybe it's time you went and saw him.

395
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,220
妈妈
Mom

396
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,130
妈妈
Mom.

397
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:41,760
不要
Don't.

398
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,600
我也想让你有个美好的未来
I'm about as excited by the prospect as you are,

399
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,210
但是有些东西是必需要放弃的
but something's gotta give

400
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,860
你再这样下去会毁了自己前程的
You have got too much potential to be screwing up your life like this.

401
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,690
如果他们把你送到 泰勒维尔 或是 马里昂 怎么办
What if they'd sent you to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

402
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,100
我想我也会这么做的
I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing in here,

403
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,520
吃吃果冻 喝喝饮料
eating Jell-O,drinking Kool-Aid.

404
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,480
我知道你要干什么
I know what you're doing.

405
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,890
你和林肯被关到一起绝非巧合
It's not luck of the draw that you're in here with Lincoln.

406
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,530
你忘了我非常了解你们俩
You forget I know you. Both of you

407
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,280
你们兄弟之间的感情 恐怕是我见过的最特别的了
You two have the most dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.

408
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,660
他为了不让你在街头胡闹而打你
What,he beats you up to keep you off the street,

409
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,580
现在你又主动和他关在一起
so you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?

410
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,780
为了什么
To what?

411
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,710
救他
Save him?

412
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,450
你应该告诉我 我曾像你一样的爱他
I deserve to know. I loved him as much as you did.

413
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,840
你的爱已成往事 而我的却不是
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

414
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,960
我大学毕业后曾给过他机会
I gave him a shot when I got back from college. I did.

415
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,670
即使在那种情况下
Even with all the stuff that was going on with him,

416
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,570
我还是尽我所能的帮助他 他却不把这些当回事
I did all I could to make it work, and he threw it away.

417
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,230
你是否曾想过在你离开他的时候 他非常的伤心
You ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place?

418
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,240
不要这样做
Don't do this.

419
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,950
无论你想做什么 不要做
Whatever it is you're doing,don't do it.

420
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,400
会有更好的办法的 我已经提出上诉了
there's a better way.I'm already appealing your case.

421
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,580
我告诉过你不要再管这件事了
I told you to leave alone

422
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,990
我已经和林肯所在地区的主教取得了联系上了
I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Linc.The bishop...

423
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,400
没用的 只能延缓一下时间而已
That won't stop it. It'll only delay it.

424
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,660
你真想帮忙么
You wanna do something?

425
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,460
找出是谁要至他于死地
You find out who's trying to bury him.

426
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,730
没有人要至他于死地
Nobody's trying to bury him.

427
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,340
证据确凿
The evidence was there.

428
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,440
证据是伪造的
The evidence was cooked.

429
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,250
探监时间结束了
Visiting hours are now over.

430
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,650
照顾好自己
Take care of yourself.

431
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,860
有人要他死 维罗妮卡
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.

432
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,510
有太多的阴谋
Something more is going on here.

433
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,050
这是在绝望 迈克尔 你是在否定事实 面对现实吧
This is desperation,Michael.You're grabbing at straws.You're in denial.

434
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,830
或许是吧 我不能看着他死 我做不到
Maybe. But I can't watch him die.I won't do that.

435
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
先生们
Gentlemen.

436
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,700
布伦斯的事 我能帮上什么忙
What is it about the Burrows situation that I can help you with?

437
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,720
我们认为你对州长有着很大的影响力
It's our understanding that you have great influence with the governor.

438
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,050
我不会说是 非常大 或是什么 影响力
I wouldn't say it's great, or influence.

439
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,140
我们是朋友
We're friends.

440
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,430
我们知道 您反对死刑
It's also our understanding that you oppose the death penalty.

441
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,460
我是上帝的子民 当然会这么认为了
I'm a man of God. How could I not?

442
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,620
在这个案子里 我们希望您能改变一下立场
In this case,we're hoping you'll suspend that position

443
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,440
至少是暂时的
at least temporarily.

444
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,260
如果囚犯需要我的干涉
If the inmate appeals to me for intervention,

445
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,010
我怎么能坐视不管呢
how can I turn my back on him?

446
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,000
我很欣赏 您用问题来回答问题
You have a habit of answering a question with a question.

447
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,160
你的方式好像是 用问题来问更多的问题
And you have a way of asking questions that beg more questions.

448
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,480
这么说来您是不同意了
Are you saying you won't do it?

449
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,010
我的话已经够明确的了
I'm not a man to equivocate.

450
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,970
您
You're what,

451
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,160
现在已经62岁了
62 years old now, Your Excellency?

452
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,030
没错
That's right.

453
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,980
那么 我想
I would assume, then,

454
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,790
您应该很清楚政府的税收政策吧
that you should be well-versed in how our government's tax system works.

455
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,830
在教会掩护下中饱私囊
Taking personal capital gains under the church's tax shelter,

456
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,930
难道阁下不认为这是一种欺骗么
well,that would be fraud, wouldn't it, Your Excellency?

457
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,530
我是不会因为恐惧 而放弃自己的信念的
I will not be cowed into forsaking my beliefs.

458
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,520
你吓不倒我 谁也做不到
Not by you, or anyone else.

459
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,780
佩服
Admirable.

460
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,860
再见
Good day, Excellency.

461
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,290
凯勒曼 先生
Mr Kellerman

462
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,210
情报局为什么对这个案件如此感兴趣
what is it about this case that the Secret Service is so interested in?

463
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,120
那人杀了副总统的哥哥
The man killed the Vice-President's brother.

464
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,490
-他说什么  -你听我说
-What did you say?  -You heard me.

465
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,470
有人找到了菲波纳奇
Someone found Fibonacci.

466
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,250
我正看着这张照片呢
I'm looking at the photos right now.

467
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,830
狗娘养的留了胡子 还戴着太阳镜
Son of a bitch has got a beard,sunglasses.

468
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,930
一看就是 证人保护计划
Witness protection if I ever saw it.

469
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,430
谁提供的消息
Who was this someone?

470
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,190
信封上面没有回信地址
There's no return address on the envelope.

471
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,120
只有一个纸做的小鸟
Just...this folded-up bird

472
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,900
折纸么
made of paper.

473
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,660
没错 就是
Like origami.

474
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,400
对 是的
Yeah,like that,like origami.

475
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,530
你是 查尔斯・韦斯特莫兰德 对吗
You're Charles Westmoreland, right?

476
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,710
咱们认识么
Do I know you?

477
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,940
我在你老婆逝世前曾认识她
I knew your wife, before she passed.

478
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,020
-你认识 玛拉   -你说得是 安妮
-You knew Marla?   -You mean Ann?

479
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,750
你是怎么认识她的
How'd you know her?

480
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,750
我们在波士顿有过谈话
We taught together in Boston.

481
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,360
-东法明敦吗   -你是说 西威灵顿 吗
-East Farmington.   -You mean West Wilmington?

482
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,240
别再考我了
No more tests

483
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,130
我保证
I promise.

484
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,070
你好像知道我的一切
Seems you know everything about me.

485
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,580
-你是谁  -迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
-Who are you?  -Michael Scofield.

486
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,460
你是怎么把它带进来的
How'd you get it in here?

487
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,720
首先  她不是它
First off, she's not an it.

488
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,610
她是 玛尔林
She's Marilyn

489
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,350
自从监狱允许囚犯带宠物
and she's grandfathered back from the days

490
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,080
她就被带进来了
when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.

491
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,650
我听说你是 D.B. 库珀
I heard you were DB Cooper.

492
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,500
一旦有新人来到这里
Every new fish comes in here

493
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,840
总能听到
first thing they hear

494
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,460
查尔斯・韦斯特莫兰德 是 D.B.库珀
is that Charles Westmoreland is DB Cooper.

495
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,660
我会像告诉他们一样的告诉你
I'll tell you like I tell them.

496
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,020
你想听 库珀 的故事么
You want the Cooper story?

497
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,150
我什么也告诉不了你 因为我不是他
I can't give it to you, cos I'm not him.

498
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,220
真可惜
It's too bad.

499
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,600
真希望 是真的 一个传奇式的人物
sort of wish it was true. The man's a legend.

500
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,520
没有人比我还想了 朋友
Nowhere near as much as I wish it were true, friend.

501
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,190
那样我就会在外面有一百五十万了
I'd have a million five waiting for me on the outside.

502
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,890
如果我是你的话我会小心点
I'd put some grass under'em if I were you.

503
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,640
如果你雇我的话 一切都会变得简单
This thing'd go a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.

504
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,190
你到底想怎样
What is this all about?

505
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,180
如果有人能把你弄出这里的高墙去
Say you were able to get outside those walls.

506
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,280
你能不能找人帮他销声匿迹
would you have the people in place to make you disappeared forever?

507
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,830
-你问这个干嘛  -只是出于好奇
-What do you care?  -I'm just curious.

508
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,050
菲波纳奇在哪儿
Where's Fibonacci?

509
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,250
这不是解决事情的方法
That's not the way it works.

510
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,160
他们要是敢动我 约翰
They come at me, John

511
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,380
我不会放过你的
I'm coming after you.

512
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,380
我还真不信
I doubt it.

513
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,820
好吧
All right.

514
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,890
我完全把你看错了 斯科菲尔德
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.

515
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,390
我认为你不是一个惹事生非的人
I didn't think you were the agitating type.

516
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,290
像那样的事情在我的监狱里是不允许的
Behaviour like that will not be tolerated in my prison.

517
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,510
九十天的禁闭
90 days in the SHU

518
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,740
足够让你想清楚的了
That ought to be enough time to convince you of that fact.

519
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,600
九十天
90 days?

520
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,360
没错
That's right.

521
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,390
你还想说什么
Something you wanna say?

522
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,700
只是...
It's just...

523
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,220
要是在禁闭房里我就不能帮你了
I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.

524
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,060
帮我
Value?

525
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,470
恩 泰姬陵
Hm- mm... the Taj.

526
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,050
要是由于承重压力分布不均
It'd be a shame for the 8th wonder of the modern

527
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,620
而使世界第八大奇迹倒塌可就太可惜了
world to collapse 'cause the stress's improperly propagated

528
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,890
重力什么分布不均?
Improperly propagated?

529
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,600
承重压力分布不均
Improperly propagated

530
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,390
结合处超过了承重极限
The joints are overloaded.

531
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,190
从而不能再提供任何的承载力
They won't provide anywhere near the sheer strength

532
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,270
以承受整个建筑物的荷载了
the completed structure will need.

533
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,960
需要花费多长的时间
How much work are we talking?

534
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,360
你是想在6月完成吧
You want it by when, June?

535
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,640
是的
Yes.

536
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,760
那么现在就该开工了 你说呢
Then we'd better get started,wouldn't you say?

537
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,550
谁啊
Who's there?

538
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
马克莫拉主教昨晚被杀了
Bishop McMorrow was killed last night.

539
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,700
在他睡觉的时候 被人枪杀了
Someone shot him while he was sleeping.

540
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,190

I thought you'd wanna know.

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,140

542
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,710
迈克尔 是对的
Michael was right.

543

水缸 有人来探监
Sink! You got a visitor.

544
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,070
他被捕了
He was arrested.

545
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,210
为什么
For what?

546
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,550
携带大麻
Possession of marijuana.

547
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,870
我认为你应该以父亲的身份给他些建议 在你...
I figured he could use some fatherly advice before it's...

548
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,570
在被 处决 之前
Gone forever?

549
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,690
我没那个意思
I didn't mean that.

550
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,950
我知道 谢谢你 莉莎
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

551

坐吧
Sit down.

552
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,850
大麻是么
Dope, huh?

553
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,280
吸食还是贩卖
Using or dealing?

554
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,380
有区别么
What's the difference?

555
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,500
你想干什么
Then what? you, uh,

556
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,530
想混出名气么
think it gives you some kind of street cred?

557
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,720
你有美好的前程 要好好珍惜
You got a piece of the good life. Take advantage.

558
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,550
好的 我明白了

It's better than being here.

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,390
你要明白 受惩罚的是你自己
You gotta realise who's getting punished

566
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,070
你做的那些事
when you're doing the things you're doing.

567
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,980
别以为受惩罚的是我 那会是你自己
You think it's me. It's you.

568
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,450
我过去也曾这样过
I did the same thing.

569
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,040
因为一个老人的离开而去责怪他
Punished the old man cos he was gone.

570
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,650
而我又得到了什么呢

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,710
我不是在求 你爱我
I'm not asking you to love me.

很久以前我就失去这个机会了
I already screwed up that chance long ago

573
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,060
我希望你能自爱
I'm asking you to love yourself.

574
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,000
现在后悔还来得及
You can still put the brakes on this thing.

575
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,540
那么  这就是所谓的父亲的建议
So that's what fatherly advice is like.

576
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,860

你在罗约尔学院读过书啊 (芝加哥大学)
