四年前  他背叛了我  这样就能拥有你了

没人能离开"21号空间"  梵

我敢说  我不是第一个对家人隐瞒身份的
I assure you, I'm not the first CIA man to hide his life

67
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,860
中情局特工

68
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,650
你隐瞒的可是中情局
You hid it from the CIA.

69
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,300
你想把事情搞砸
Look, you want to screw something up?

70
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,390
那就码一千个人来做  你想把事做对
Put a thousand people on it. You want to get it done right?

71
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,290
那就找几个精英  我们一直以来所做的事
Put it in the hands of a few. What we were doing

72
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,840
就是推进这个国家的伟业

把阿布·拉马尔这种人放出来

之前的任务

都是为了这个国家好  但是...

不  这件事跟国家没有关系
No, this one wasn't about country.

跟你有关
It was about you.

没有人想要为了过去的生活奋不顾身  莎拉
Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.

81
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,070
迈克尔可不这样
And Michael didn't.

82
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,230
他极其渴望自己能把握住过去
He wanted to hold on to it so desperately.

83
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,970
就在那一刻  我想让他消失

84
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,840
放弃和他的整个协议  只要我能拥有你

你把他派到也门去送死

我一直告诉自己这是我的最后一个谎言

你纠结于迈克尔不放
You were so obsessed with Michael

你并不爱我  你太自我了
You don't love me. Your ego's too big.

100

你一心只想要成为最聪明的人
You're too busy trying to be the smartest man in the room.

101
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,160
然后你遇到了我丈夫
And then you met my husband,

102
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,510
你意识到
and you realized

103
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,960
他比你聪明
he's smarter than you.

104
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,280
我不这么认为

不不不  别跟他说话
No, no, no. Don't talk to him.

116

否则会怎样  他会做一些
Or what? He'll do something

117
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,240
你不打算要做的事吗  你会杀了我
you're not already gonna do? You're going to kill me.

118
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,030
不管你先跟我说多少次你爱我
No matter how many times you tell me you love me first.

119

闭嘴

120
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,120
哈伦·盖恩斯不是迈克尔杀的  他没有动机
Michael didn't kill Harlan Gaines. He had no motive.

121
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,220
-闭嘴  -他才是那个有杀人动机的人
- Shut up. - He's the one with the motive.

哈伦·盖恩斯曾是你在中情局的局长
Harlan Gaines was your CIA director

123

他在调查雅各布

124
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,960
他本来要把他关进监狱
He was gonna put him prison.

125
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,320

封起来

128
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,540
如果你这么做  就会害死一个无辜的人
If you do, an innocent man dies,

129
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,180
而放走真正的凶手
and the real killer walks.

130
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,970
你还不明白吗
Don't you understand?

131

这个地方会在十分钟后烧毁

137
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,640
里面会有两具尸体
There will be two bodies in it.

138
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,030
如果这算是安慰的话
And if it's any solace,

139
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,780
我们的儿子不会是其中之一
our son won't be one of them.

140
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,220
山中无老虎  猴子称大王

我会救你和你妈妈出去
I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.

144

我没画过地图
I didn't draw a map.

145
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,900
我们得快跑
We need to run.

146
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,410
等一下
Wait.

147
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,480

What are you doing up here, Van?

148
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,130
我就想确定我们抓对人了
I just want to make sure that we're getting the right guy.

149
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,050
问他一些问题
Ask him some questions.

150
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,490

Do whatever you want with me.

152
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,410
只要你们放我儿子走
Just let my son go.

153
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,010
命令不是让我们不该问的也问
Orders weren't to ask questions.

154
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,380
而是格杀勿论
It was to shoot on sight.

155
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,190
或许我们应该问几个问题  妈的
Maybe we should ask questions, damn it.

156
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,010
如果斯科菲尔德杀了哈伦·盖恩斯
If Scofield killed Harlan Gaines,

157
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,280
必要时我们可以把他交给警方
we take him to the police, if we have to.

158
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,140
我们应该用正当的途径解决
We get this done the right way.

159
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,820
波塞冬不会放过我们的
Poseidon would never let us live.

160
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,280
他不会找到我们的
He won't find us.

161
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,130
我跟你说过  我们想销声匿迹就一定可以
I told you. We want to disappear, we disappear.

162
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,750
我能做得到的
I can make that happen.

163
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,150
我们把他交给警方
We turn him in,

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
然后就走人
and we're gone.

165
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,870
别逼我做这样的选择
Don't make me choose like this.

166
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,860
艾米丽
Emily.

167
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,150
我们果真有的选吗
Is it really even a choice?

168
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,860
没有
No.

169
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,930
因为没人能离开"21号空间"
'Cause there's no leaving 21-Void.

170
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,070
快走  你伯伯在车道尽头
Go. Your uncle's at the end of the driveway.

171
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,040
别回头  跑  快
Don't turn around. Run! Go!

172
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,210
莎拉
Sara.

173
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,230
我们儿子在哪
Where's our boy?

174
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,220
林肯伯伯  林肯伯伯
Uncle Lincoln, Uncle Lincoln!

175
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,160
不  不  是我  发生什么事了
No, no, no, it's me. What's going on?

176
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,470
有人在开枪  我很害怕
They're shooting. I'm scared.

177
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,990
-他们是来抓你的  -谁
- Okay. They've come for you. - ‭Who?

178
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,490
我不会让他们伤害你
I am not gonna let them hurt you,

179
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,330
明白吗  上车
you understand? Get in the car.

180
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,220
我们现在就得走  麦克  现在就走
No, we've got to go now, Mike. We've got to go.

181
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,630
妈妈怎么办呢
What about my mom?

182
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,560
走  走  走
Go, go, go.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,040
麦克
Mike!

184
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,230
麦克  不
Mike! No!

185
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,550
不
No!

186
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,370
不
No!

187
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,320
麦克
Mike!

188
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,480
他抓走了他
He took him.

189
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,200
-莎拉  -他抓走了我们的儿子
- Sara... - ‭He took our son.

190
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,600
冷静  冷静  亲爱的
Come back to me. Come back to me, sweetheart.

191
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,690
冷静下来
Come back to me.

192
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,970
我们得集中注意力  好吗
We got to stay focused, all right?

193
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,080
这事还没完  很大程度上还没完
This is not over. Not by a long shot.

194
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,470
-林肯在哪  -什么
- Where's Linc? - ‭What?

195
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,520
我们得找到林肯  好吗
We got to find Linc, okay?

196
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,660
我们得找到林肯
We're gonna find Linc.

197
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,180
林肯
Linc.

198
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,200
天啊
Oh my God.

199
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,890
林肯  林肯
Linc. Linc.

200
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,770
我让你失望了  迈克尔
I let you down, Michael.

201
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,860
我当时本该抓住时机解决卢卡
I should have taken care of Luca when I had the chance.

202
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,100
你没让我失望  你当时也料不到会这样
You didn't let me down. You couldn't have known.

203
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,770
多亏了你  我们快成功了  哥
We're so close because of you, Linc.

204
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,170
是你把我救回家的
You got me home.

205
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,640
是你
You got me home.

206
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,150
他们稳定他的伤势了  迈克尔
They've stabilized him, Michael.

207
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,580
我们也帮不上什么了
There's nothing we can do.

208
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,820
我们现在还是赶快离开吧
We've got to get you out of here right now.

209
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,000
你得给我点人生建议  知道不
Okay, you got to give me some direction here, you know?

210
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,700
一些...
Some, um...

211
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,240
父辈的建议
fatherly advice

212
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,040
怎样和你这样的父亲...
on how to deal with having a father that's, um...

213
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,180
相处
you.

214
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,150
好吧  你知道...
Well, you know, uh...

215
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,530
你是不是和我一样  看见这瓶子血就抓狂
Is this blood freaking you out like it's freaking me out?

216
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,100
对啊  对啊  我来...
Yeah, yeah. Let me, uh...

217
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,470
迈克尔说完成这件事会让我们都得到救赎
Scofield said that it would deliver me. Both of us.

218
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,670
我所需要做的
All I have to do

219
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,470
就是把血带给他
is just get it to him.

220
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,170
我明白其中缘由
I understand why.

221
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,630
所以我才能最后明白这句话
So I can finally understand this.

222
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,520
他给你的吗
He give you this?

223
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,520
"经汝之手  晓'后史'之荣耀"
"By your hand, you shall know the glories of your progeny..."

224
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,360
不对  不对...
I-It's, it's...

225
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,640
是"后世"  孩子
It's "Progeny," Dear boy.

226
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,000
"后世"
"Progeny."

227
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,110
"吾等世界终将拨乱反正  永垂不朽"
"And our world will be made right forevermore."

228
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,790
最初  我觉得这事和宗教有关
Originally, I thought it was a religious thing.

229
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,370
上帝之子啊什么的
You know, son of God, and all that.

230
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,670
但现在我明白...
But now I know it's...

231
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,800
这句话就是对我说的
it's my own progeny.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,070
而你
You.

233
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,120
就是我遇到的真正美好的事
It's a glorious thing indeed.

234
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,850
就算我现在不知道该怎么处理我们的关系
Even if I don't have a damn clue how to deal with it.

235
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,320
彼此彼此
You and me both.

236
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,760
我有个把我们儿子救回来的办法  莎拉
I've got a way to get our son back, Sara.

237
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,660
自从他逼迫我疏远你和麦克
I've been planning to bring Jacob down

238
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,900
我就一直在计划如何扳倒雅各布
ever since he forced me to turn my back on you and Mike.

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,830
自从我进了也门监狱
A plan I had to put on hold

240
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,340
这个计划就搁浅了
while I was in that Yemeni prison.

241
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,570
我必须要等到从监狱逃出来
I had to wait till I got out.

242
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,010
等到万事俱备的时候
Till everything aligned.

243
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,650
等到现在  才能执行
Till now.

244
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,970
告诉我你有结果了
Tell me you got something.

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
差点逃过了我的眼睛
It's eluding me.

246
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,310
在眼睛里有更深一层的编码
There's an even bigger code encrypted into the eyes.

247
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,360
内容是什么
And what's it say?

248
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,160
我还不知道
I don't know yet.

249
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,400
按照我现在的破解速度
But with the amount of processing power I throw at it,

250
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,300
我们很快就会有结果的
we're gonna find out real soon.

251
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,810
怎么了
What's wrong?

252
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,480
我不知道该怎么告诉你
I-I don't know how to say it, so, um...

253
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,950
刚才那个人是个警探
That man was a police detective,

254
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,490
他刚刚告诉我  你妈...
and he told me your moth...

255
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,160
你妈死了
your mother's dead.

256
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,070
什么
What?

257
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,420
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

258
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,860
不过我会带你去一个安全的地方
But I'm gonna take you somewhere safe,

259
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,050
在那里  没有人能伤害你  也没人能找到你
where those people that are trying to hurt you can't reach you.

260
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,900
为什么会有人想伤害我呢
Why would they try and hurt me?

261
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,900
这是因为我爱你
It's because I love you.

262
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,270
而这些人想伤害我
And they're trying to hurt me--

263
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,640
所以他们才会伤害我最爱的人
take the one thing that I truly love away.

264
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,210
那他们为什么想伤害你
Why would they try and hurt you?

265
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,350
这是因为有一些关于我的事我还没告诉你
Because there are some things I haven't told you about me.

266
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,920
我给你寄那封信是有原因的
I sent that letter to you for a reason.

267
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,810
波塞冬当时正在监视 
Poseidon was monitoring my communications

268
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,550
一切对我可能有利的资源或者盟友
with everyone who could possibly be a resource or an ally,

269
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,830
但没有监视曾被我鄙视的人
but not with people I despised.

270
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,870
直说吧  你到底怎么看我这个人
Give it to me straight-- how you really feel about me?

271
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,450
我想过  如果我给予一个人
I figured if I showed grace to a man

272
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,910
他此生从未体验过的恩惠
who'd never seen it before in his life,

273
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,610
或许他会为了表达感激
maybe he'd be grateful,

274
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,940
而为我们做一些事情
do something for us.

275
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,220
为我们所有人
All of us,

276
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,390
也包括为他自己
himself included.

277
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,330
"吾等世界终将拨乱反正  永垂不朽"
"And our lives shall be made right forevermore."

278
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,560
我是指普通人的生活
I'm talking about normal, everyday life.

279
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,360
一种我们很久很久
The kind of freedom none of us has known

280
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,800
没有体验过的生活
in a long, long time.

281
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,460
但波塞冬并不想放过我们
But Poseidon's not just gonna let us go.

282
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,480
他将我和你儿子牢牢控制在其股掌之中
He's got me and your son in an iron grip.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,060
必须得有人让他罢手
Someone has to make him let go.

284
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,160
你明白吗
Do you understand?

285
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,340
我完全理解你的意思
I'm tracking where you're going.

286
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,400
可以使我们过上你说的那种
Only way we're gonna get that

287
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,950
美好而又普通生活的唯一方法
beautiful, mundane life you're talking-- any of us--

288
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,400
就是我杀了他
is if I take his.

289
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,990
我们暂时安全了
We'll be safe here for now.

290
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,290
听着 
Hey, listen,

291
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,900
我保证我会跟你解释一切
I promised I'd explain.

292
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,770
那些人在追杀我的原因
The reason those people are after me...

293
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,840
我明白  对你来说会很难相信
I know this is gonna be hard to believe,

294
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,230
但简单来说  我是一个秘密特工
but I'm basically a secret agent.

295
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,870
{\an8}扫描已启动

296
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,200
{\an8}图像采集

297
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,140
快进来
Come on in.

298
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,280
你记得你在后院里的城堡吗
You know that fort you've got in the backyard?

299
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,760
在那种地方的感觉很棒  对不对
It feels good to go somewhere like that, right?

300
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,310
一个无人知晓  没人能找到你的地方
A place no one knows about, where no one can get to you.

301
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,140
这里对我来说也是一样
Well, that's what this place is for me.

302
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,040
没事的  没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

303
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,730
能给他看看你的证件吗  布莱克特工
Would you please show him your credentials, Agent Blake?

304
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,650
中情局埃米莉·布莱克特工
Agent Emily Blake, CIA.

305
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,940
我为我之前在你家里不得已的行为表示道歉
I'm sorry that had to happen in front of you at the house.

306
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,260
当时她是被派去家里保护你的
She was stationed at the house to protect you...

307
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,120
就是让你不受后来那个男人的伤害
from exactly the man who ended up coming,

308
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,160
那个声称是你父亲的人
the man who said he was your dad.

309
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,720
真的吗
Really?

310
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,420
{\an8}联调局和中情局
通缉  卡尼尔·乌提斯

311
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,960
为了保护国家  这些年我结下许多仇人
I've made enemies defending America over the years.

312
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,300
最糟糕的是  这个人
Worst part is that this particular one

313
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,600
勾起了你对父亲的回忆
dredged up the memory of your father.

314
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,000
事实上  麦克
The truth is, Mikey,

315
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,870
尽管你或许想相信这些
despite what you may want to believe,

316
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,040
可你父亲在七年前就已经去世了
your father died seven years ago.

317
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,340
喂
Yeah.

318
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,220
我是迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
This is Michael Scofield.

319
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,840
我们正聊起你的事呢
We were just talking about you.

320
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,830
我现在给你最后一次活命的机会
I'm giving you one last chance to save your life.

321
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,630
把孩子交给我  不然我不敢保证
Hand the boy over or I can't be held responsible

322
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,040
接下去会发生什么事
for what happens next.

323
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,450
你是在威胁会杀死我吗
Are you threatening my life?

324
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,490
如果你不把他交给我的话
Only if you don't hand him over.

325
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,730
我永远不会交出我的儿子
I'd never hand over my son.

326
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,990
他自始至终都不是你的儿子
He's not your son and never was.

327
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,620
离我爸爸远点  听见了吗
Stay away from my dad, you hear?

328
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,910
离他远点
Stay away!

329
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,500
好孩子
Good boy.

330
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,900
他叫那个人爸爸
He called him Dad.

331
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,290
雅各布
Jacob.

332
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,730
不  他只是在对他洗脑
No, he's-he's brainwashing him, that's all.

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,800
你是对的  那样的人
Man like that, you're right.

334
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,110
他只配去死
He deserves to die.

335
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,140
他在哪
Where is he?

336
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,110
波塞冬在哪
Where is Poseidon?

337
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,190
我来解决他
He'll be dealt with.

338
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,380
等等  稍等一下
Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on, man.

339
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,110
如果你被抓了
If you get caught--

340
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,570
如果他被抓了  他就得回监狱
if he gets caught, he's going back to the pen.

341
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,540
-别这样  别  -我不会...
- Come on, come on. - ‭I'm not...

342
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,780
如果我不这么做呢
And if I don't do it?

343
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,620
小逃犯  我想让你恢复自由和清白
Criminy, I want you free and clear,

344
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,320
如果这是唯一的办法  那只能是由我去做
and if that's the only way to do it, then I got to be the one that does it.

345
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
斯科菲尔德不会这么做
Scofield ain't gonna do it.

346
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,500
他没有杀人的天分
He don't got the killing gene.

347
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,560
没人会被抓
No one is getting caught.

348
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,960
这点我明确表态
There's a very specific order to this.

349
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,270
莎拉  我要你保障林肯的安全
Sara, I want you to make sure Linc's safe

350
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,020
  不能让他有事
and out of harm's way.

351
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,070
维普  茶包哥去帮我们找一张"百搭牌"[外援]
Whip, T-Bag, you're gonna collect a wild card for us.

352
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,250
一张雅各布都不知道它存在的"百搭牌"[外援]
One that Jacob doesn't know is out there.

353
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,330
我要去他们老巢  这一切开始的源头
I'm gonna go to the nest, where this all started,

354
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,090
那个隐藏着所有秘密的地方
where the secrets lay hidden,

355
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,040
那个终将血债血偿的正确所在
and where blood will finally be spilled in its rightful place.

356
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,250
我刚接的来自斯科菲尔德的那通电话
The call I just got from Scofield--

357
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,810
我想知道它是从哪打来的
I want to know where it came from.

358
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,320
正在向你发送地点信息
Location data coming to you right now.

359
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,860
他们在某个偏远的地方
Middle of nowhere.

360
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,940
向东北方向移动  然后手机关机了
Started moving northeast and the phone was shut off.

361
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,480
也许是扔了
Maybe tossed.

362
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,790
{\an8}北纽约动物园

363
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,520
你和你那该死的动物园  斯科菲尔德
You and your damn zoo, Scofield.

364
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,120
我要彻底搞明白
I'm gonna find out once and for all

365
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,900
当时你究竟在那里干什么
what you were really doing there.

366
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,590
当时你究竟在计划什么
What you were really planning.

367
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,480
然后我会杀了你
And then I'm gonna kill you.

368
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,520
你的事我全都知道
I know everything about you.

369
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,820
连你最平常的小动作都知道
Even your most mundane actions.

370
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,010
比如动物园  你和动物园算怎么回事
Like the zoo. What's with you and the zoo?

371
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,870
{\an8}敌人

372
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,250
{\an8}敌人犯

373
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,730
我告诉自己  那个将其计划
I had to know everything about the man

374
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,070
纹在身上的人  我得了解他的一切
who wore his plans on his skin.

375
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,250
看似一览无遗  实则神秘莫测
In plain sight, yet so mysterious.

376
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,590
{\an8}你的敌人犯

377
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,840
{\an8}永远别  你的敌人犯

378
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,220
{\an8}永远别在你的敌人犯

379
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,110
实权的秘诀
The secret to real power

380
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,640
在于决不违背你的意愿
is to never betray your intentions.

381
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,170
深藏不露
To wear nothing on your sleeve,

382
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,500
也决不让任何人看见你的脸
and to never let anyone see your face.

383
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,590
{\an8}{\pos(74.005,198.718)}伊萨卡大学

384
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,240
我永远会先你一步
I'll always be a step ahead of you.

385
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,840
我能从你的眼神中看穿一切
I can see everything in your eyes.

386
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,760
怎么
What?

387
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,170
我解开了眼睛里的密码
I decrypted the code from the eyes.

388
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,310
是引用了拿破仑的一句话
It's a quote from Napoleon.

389
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,680
引用了什么
What quote?

390
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,330
"永远别在你的敌人犯错误时打断他们"
"Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake."

391
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,190
眼神背后的心机才是关键
It's what's behind the eyes that counts.

392
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,090
{\an8}构建面部轮廓比对

393
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,470
{\an8}构建匹配

394
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
{\an8}身份匹配已获取

395
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,630
-喂  -我觉得应该告诉你
- Yeah. - Thought you should know

396
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,030
我正看着你的秘密服务器
I'm looking at your closed servers right now.

397
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,900
你的硬盘在我手上
I'm holding your hard drives in my hand.

398
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,890
你所有的秘密通讯
All your secret communications.

399
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,080
足够让你永久出局了
Enough to send you away forever.

400
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,710
不赖嘛  迈克尔
Bravo, Michael.

401
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,370
无论你是怎么进去的  真不赖
However you got in there, bravo.

402
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,660
你把我骗来动物园  你就能进我办公室
You sent me to the zoo so you could get into my office.

403
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,000
但我俩都清楚你的威胁没有力度
But you and I both know your threat's a hollow one,

404
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,080
因为你知道我手上有样东西
because you know I've got something

405
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,420
对你来说更有价值  你的儿子
that's even more valuable to you: your son.

406
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,260
所以我们又回归博弈论了
So we're back to game theory.

407
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,080
我们是一起合作  达成交易
Do we work together, make a trade

408
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,530
然后各取所需呢
so we both get what we want?

409
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,230
还是你要耍花招呢
Or are you gonna try something underhanded?

410
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,590
-你知道我会的  -我也会
- You know I will. - As will I.

411
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,620
所以不如放下此事  做笔交易
So why don't we cut past that and make a deal?

412
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,220
行  迈克尔  就那样办
Sure, Michael. Yeah, let's do that.

413
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,470
老船坞
Old shipyard.

414
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,740
A仓库
Warehouse A.

415
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,130
明天下午五点
5:00 P.M. Tomorrow.

416
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,240
行
Fine.

417
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,800
抱歉
Excuse me?

418
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,170
我老公他哥  林肯·布鲁斯
My brother-in-law... did-did Lincoln Burrows,

419
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,460
被送到其他病房了吗
did he get moved?

420
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,290
没有  女士  他自行出院了
No, ma'am. He checked himself out.

421
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,860
-他流了很多血  -我知道
- He was down a lot of blood. ‭- I know.

422
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,940
我们阻止过他  但如果病人坚持
We tried to stop him, but if a patient insists,

423
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,370
如果他们力所能及的话  我们只能放人
if it's within their power, we have to let 'em go.

424
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,430
这位是巴拉德医生  他负责手术
This is Dr. Ballard. He did the surgery.

425
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,690
你好  莎拉·斯科菲尔德
‭Hi, Sara Scofield,

426
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,060
我是个伊萨卡的内科医生
I'm an internist, actually, up at Ithaca.

427
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,000
你知道我老公他哥可能去了哪吗
Do you have any idea where my brother-in-law might have gone?

428
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,880
不知道
No idea.

429
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,570
好吧
Right.

430
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,100
手指湖区发生什么事了  你知道吗
What happened up in Finger Lakes, do you know?

431
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,520
同一地区同一时间的还送来了
Another gunshot victim came in from the same area

432
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,710
另一个枪伤患者
at the same time.

433
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,430
我老公他哥是独自一人  肯定是巧合
My brother-in-law was alone. It must be a coincidence.

434
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,560
但谢谢了
But thank you.

435
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,480
我要走了  我已经尽我所能了
Well, I'm heading out. I've done what I can.

436
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,730
他在三楼  用着生命维持系统
He's on life support up on three,

437
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,930
但说实话  我觉得他撑不到早上
but candidly, I don't think he's making it till morning.

438
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,780
卢卡
Luca.

439
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,750
你害我还躲了你一阵
You had me running there for a bit,

440
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,940
还以为我干了什么坏事
thinking I'd done something wrong.

441
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,780
你就是干了  
You did.

442
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,630
你骗了我  欠的十万美金不还
You stiffed me $100 grand.

443
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,740
不  那是用受害者的血换来的钱
Nah. It's blood money.

444
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,110
这种脏钱没有什么欠不欠的
No debts with blood money.

445
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,370
快说"我们两清了"
Say we're clear.

446
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,730
来舔哥呀  布鲁斯
Eat me, Burrows.

447
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,220
叫你快说"我们两清了"
Say we're clear.

448
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,950
我会多叫几个弟兄
I'm gonna get more guys.

449
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,540
然后哥看你接着逃得像丧家犬
And you'll be running again.

450
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,050
这次不行了
Not this time.

451
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,770
那些又是你朋友假扮的吗
Are those your fake friends again?

452
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,560
你这狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

453
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,600
不  这次是真的
No. This time, they're real.

454
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,630
我们是联邦探员
Federal agents!

455
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,030
把手举起来
Hands where I can see 'em!

456
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,570
-举起手来  -布鲁斯
- Hands up! - Burrows!

457
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,770
现在照做
Do it now!

458
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,480
布鲁斯
Burrows!

459
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,660
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

460
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,220
我要找我儿子
I need to find my boy.

461
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,260
给
Here.

462
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,690
{\an8}让

463
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:00,770
{\an8}让我

464
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,100
{\an8}让我死

465
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,470
他是个恶魔  还抓了我儿子
He's an evil man and he's got my son.

466
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,990
你肯定知道什么人  知道点什么
You've got to know someone. Something.

467
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,230
知道我能把我孩子救回来的办法
Someway I can get my boy back.

468
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,980
拜托
Please.

469
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,700
你确定我儿子在这里吗
You sure this is where my son is?

470
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,430
谢谢
Thank you.

471
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,280
没事了
It's all right.

472
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,120
杀人是不对的
Killing ain't right.

473
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,540
对  我读过《圣经》
Yeah, I read the Bible.

474
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,230
真的吗
You did?

475
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,070
我曾在旅店房间里大概翻了翻
You know, I scanned it once in a hotel room.

476
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,620
你有什么感悟吗
Well, what you gonna do?

477
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,470
除非某人罪有应得  否则别滥杀无辜
Don't kill anybody unless they really deserve it.

478
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,990
你读的肯定是《旧约》部分
Yeah, you must've read the Old Testament part.

479
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,060
以眼还眼  以牙还牙
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

480
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,920
对  随你怎么说
Sure, whatever.

481
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,150
对  我只是想说
Yeah, I'm just saying,

482
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,970
有时候  一些众人皆知的恶棍
sometimes, certain-- certain sons of bitches,

483
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,250
就该用这种老办法铲除他们
they just need to be plain old eradicated.

484
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,670
没有他们这个世界会更好
World's just better minus them.

485
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,970
比如阿布·拉马尔
Like Abu Ramal.

486
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,120
但大部分情况下  杀人是不对的
But for the most part, you know, killing's just bad.

487
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,530
当然了
Yeah, absolutely.

488
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,920
除了波塞冬
Except Poseidon. ‭

489
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,350
-他也得死  -他得死
- Yeah, he's got to go, too. - Got to go.

490
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,060
我只是不想让你对我的看法
I just don't want you to get the wrong idea

491
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,070
-有误会  好吗  -好
- about me, okay? - ‭Okay.

492
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,550
你得像瑜伽师一样看问题  懂吗
You got to see it like the yogis, okay?

493
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,020
消除消极面以创造积极的一面
Destroying the negative to create the positive.

494
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,560
"湿婆之舞"之类的
"The dance of the Shivas"   and all that.

抹杀黑暗  光明才能诞生
Murder the dark, so the-- the light can be born.

你是疯了吧

在呢  别磨蹭了  进来吧
Yeah, don't just dillydally, come on in.

I assume you two desperados are Scofield's guys.

502
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,240
是
Yeah.

503

他也把你们从监狱里救出来了吗
He get you out of prison, too?

504
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,370
不是
No.

505
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,370
不过我确实欠他人情
But I do owe him.

506
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,310
他把你从哪救出来的
Where'd he break you out of?

507
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,200
南美洲  巴兰基亚
Barranquilla, South America.

508
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,680
那里的人要把我生吞活剥
They were gonna eat my lunch down there,

509
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,020
谁让我长得这么俊俏呢
pretty boy like me.

510
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,680
斯科菲尔德同情我
Scofield took pity.

511
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,620
我猜是看到我有什么天赋  把我救了出去
Saw a talent in me, I guess. Got me out.

512
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,550
他说可能哪天用得着我的天赋
Said he might call on those talents some day in return,

513
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,040

让它变得真实
Make it real.

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,500
看见你的脸
see your face.

619
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,580
别动  举起手来
Freeze! Get your hands up!

620
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,250
走好  儿子
Go easy, son.

621
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,680
近来可好
How we doing?

622
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,860
比你要好
Better than you.

623
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,830
谢天谢地
Thank God.

624
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,670
你还好吗
You okay?

625
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,720
前面  就放在下一个隔间
Up ahead, in the next bay.

626
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,230
这电话我来接
I'll take that call.

627
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,520
找到了  迈克尔  救出我们儿子了
We got him, Michael. We got our boy.

628
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,450
恭喜你啊
Good news for you.

629
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,140
但现在你也没必要给我我想要的东西了
But now you've got no reason to give me what I want.

630
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,480
这对你来说也算是个坏消息
which kind of makes it bad news for you.

631
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,240
联邦探员
Federal agents!

632
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,050
你个贱人
You son of a bitch.

633
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,990
那间小屋
The cabin.

634
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,540
盖恩斯的外套
Gaines' jacket.

635
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,130
摄像头  拍下我的样子
Camera, taking my picture.

636
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,190
空包弹[即没有弹头]
Blanks.

637
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,320
刚才你是故意让我把枪从你手上抢走
You wanted me to take the gun from you back there.

638
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,750
你比我原想的要厉害啊
You're better than I thought.

639
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,740
把我犯下的谋杀罪再栽赃给我
Re-framing me for the murder I actually committed.

640
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,600
是你栽赃给我的那个
The one you framed me for.

641
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,130
迈克尔  搬走尸体
Michael, pick up the body,

642
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,940
清理现场  什么痕迹都不能留
make it look like it never happened.

643
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,890
真是天才  真的
Genius, really.

644
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,770
可惜没人会相信
But no one will ever go for it.

645
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,350
真相是你给世人展现的样子
The truth is whatever you tell people it is.

646
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,210
你教我的
You taught me that.

647
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,070
可惜两分钟后联邦探员就会赶到这里
Too bad the feds'll be here in two minutes,

648
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,720
看到你布置的场景
see your little diorama here,

649
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,850
就会知道这一切都是假象
and know it's all bull.

650
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,580
只是那时这些都不在了
Except none of this will be here.

651
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,700
我也不会在
And neither will I.

652
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,710
{\an8}大型卡车

653
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,120
王八蛋
Bastard!

654
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,700
这是为过去这七年
This is for the last seven years.

655
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,300
别动  举起双手
Freeze! Get your hands up!

656
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,020
举起双手
Put 'em up!

657
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,350
是他  是卡尼尔·乌提斯
It's him! It's Kaniel Outis!

658
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,490
幸好你们来了
Thank God you're here.

659
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,440
谢天谢地
Thank God!

660
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,140
谢天谢地
Thank God.

661
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,040
谢天谢地
Thank God.

662
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,140
手举起来
Hands up!

663
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,460
幸好你们及时赶到了
Thank God you guys got here when you did,

664
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,980
我的感激难以言表
that's all I can say.

665
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,070
否则他就会...
I mean, he would have...

666
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,620
否则我现在已经是死人了
I'd be dead right now.

667
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,600
如果你们同意的话
Look, if it's okay with you guys,

668
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,000
我想回家  收拾一下
I'd like to go home, clean myself up a bit.

669
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,740
你们也能想到  今天有够漫长的
As you can imagine, it's been a long day.

670
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,800
-可以  -谢谢
- That's okay. - Thank you.

671
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,070
雅各布·安东·奈斯吗
Jacob Anton Ness?

672
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,800
有事吗
Can I help you?

673
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,060
你因涉嫌谋杀哈伦·盖恩斯被捕了
You're under arrest for the participation in the murder of Harlan Gaines.

674
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,970
如果你是指那些荒唐的布景...
If you're talking about that nonsense in there... ‭

675
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,330
我们是指在你大学的办公室里发现的
We're talking about blood evidence found in your office

676
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,740
血迹证据
at the university.

677
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,050
只有你有进入权限的办公室
An office only you have access to.

678
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,500
哈伦·盖恩斯的血迹
Harlan Gaines' blood.

679
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,030
"鲜血"终将洒在它应在的位置
And blood will finally be spilled in its rightful place.

680
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,030
{\an8}{\pos(188.625,238)}[那个终将"血"债"血"偿的正确所在]

681
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,640
什么  怎么会...
What? How...

682
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,950
这是那晚谋杀丢失的画面
These are the missing frames from the night of the killing.

683
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,440
是被波塞冬删去的画面
The ones Poseidon edited out.

684
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,580
没错  我当时在场  这一点我从未否认
Yes, I was there. I've never denied it.

685
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,920
他逼我去的...
He forced me to...

686
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,740
就为了陷害我
so he could frame me.

687
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,900
所以你物品上的血迹证据
So the blood evidence found in your belongings

688
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,250
是他让你处理尸体时留下的
was because he tasked you with disposing of the body.

689
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,480
没错
Correct.

690
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,220
加上在他大学办公室里发现的
And with the revelation of the additional blood evidence

691
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,050
另外的血迹证据
found in his office at the university,

692
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,450
恰好佐证了你的说法  对吗
it neatly supports your theory, doesn't it?

693
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,030
证明了他当时在场
That he was there.

694
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,310
证明了开枪的人  是他
That he was the gunman.

695
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,790
我想我只有一个问题问你
I guess I would have one question for you.

696
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,810
-我是中情局局长  -我知道
- I'm director of the CIA. - I'm aware of that.

697
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,600
所以我才直接把证据发电子邮件给你
That's why I sent you the e-mail with the evidence directly.

698
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,790
我的问题是
My question is...

699
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,870
谁知道你现在是不是也在操控我
would you be manipulating me, too?

700
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,120
我能怎么操控你
How would I do that?

701
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,160
这个...
Well...

702
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,830
你要是仔细研究这些证据
you look too closely at this evidence--

703
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,620
照片元数据  腐化的血迹证据
metadata in the pictures, degraded blood evidence--

704
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,180
也许会发现些问题
you might find some problems.

705
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,970
就看你有多想仔细地研究这些证据了
Depends how motivated you are to look closely.

706
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,030
波塞冬杀死了你的副局
Poseidon killed your deputy director.

707
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,190
他是你们机构中滞留多年的毒瘤
He was a cancer inside your agency for years.

708
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,480
我让你看到了他的真面目
I've shown you his face!

709
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,780
镇定
Now, calm down.

710
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,400
你要知道我们抓到了奈斯先生的同伙
You should know that we have Mr. Ness' accomplice,

711
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,260
安德鲁·尼尔森  已被拘禁
Andrew Nelson, in custody,

712
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,800
多亏了你哥哥
thanks to your brother,

713
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,320
看完你的电子邮件
Once we saw your e-mail,

714
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,820
我们就审讯了他
we interrogated him.

715
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,200
他对"21号空间"的阴谋供认不讳
He's fully disclosed 21-Void's conspiracy

716
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,910
包括他曾把谋杀哈伦·盖恩斯的事栽赃给你
to frame you for the murder of Harlan Gaines

717
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,250
隐瞒你的身份  给了你一个新名字
and bury your identity by giving you a new one:

718
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,280
卡尼尔·乌提斯
Kaniel Outis.

719
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,760
所以呢
What does that mean?

720
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,190
所以...
It means...

721
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,520
你自由了  斯科菲尔德先生
...you're free to go, Mr. Scofield.

722
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,560
你不知道我等别人叫我这个名字等了多久
You don't know how long I've waited to hear someone call me that.

723
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,360
还有一件事
One other thing.

724
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,180
你的这整个计划极其周密
The level of ingenuity that you displayed with all of this--

725
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,120
我们需要你这样的人才
we could use a person like that.

726
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,680
但我现在不想找工作
I am not looking for a job.

727
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,650
好吧
Right.

728
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,660
你倒是可以为我做一件事
There is one thing you can do for me.

729
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,740
你喜欢这里吗
You liking it here?

730
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,980
感觉很奇怪
It's strange.

731
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,370
重获新生
Being alive again.

732
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,580
不再四处逃亡
Not running.

733
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,890
是啊
Yeah.

734
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,340
我也曾经四处逃亡
I've been running, too.

735
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,790
我知道
I know.

736
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,800
你为什么联系她
Why'd you call her?

737
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,910
因为我知道你不会
Because I knew you wouldn't.

738
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,630
真正奇怪的是...
What's really strange is...

739
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,250
这一切竟然真的成了
things actually working out.

740
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,850
是啊
Yeah.

741
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,920
好兄弟
I love you.

742
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,350
好兄弟
I love you, too.

743
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,520
他更擅长让自己卷入...
He's better at getting himself into...

744
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,140
他很固执
He's stubborn.

745
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,610
-嗨  -亲爱的
- Hey. - Hey, babe.
