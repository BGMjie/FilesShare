我们应该还有一天
We got a day,

46

顶多两天时间离开这鬼地方
maybe two, tops, to get out of this hole.

47
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,510
非常时期  非常手段

迈克尔想联系我们
Michael's reaching out to us.

我们得找人帮忙  一个叫希巴的女人

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,920
你弟弟喜欢说谜语  是不是

ISIL的人  我们的车会被拦下来
ISIL. We're gonna get stopped.

52
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,730
不如我们忘记彼此的存在
Why don't we forget each other ever existed.

53
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,440
美人可不是那么轻易就被忘记的

需要为自己而利用这些关系的那一刻
you need to manipulate the relationship to your advantage.

你答应了帮他  那怎么帮

70
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,730
只要我能想办法让全城停电

有人找到了我的父亲

他说是"泡泡糖侠"派他来的
He says Bubble Gum Man sent him.

83
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,070
是在监狱里的人  他也没见过
Someone in the prison he hasn't met,

84
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,930
不过他用泡泡糖作为给他的差遣费
but gives him gum in exchange for errands.

85
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,610
他说他很害怕
He says he's frightened.

86
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,830
告诉他没事的
Tell him it's all right.

87
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,280
问他收不收嘀嗒糖
Ask him if he does Tic Tacs.

88
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,330
如果他继续送信
He can have the whole lot

89
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,420
他就能拿到一大堆
if he keeps the messages coming.

90
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,370
谢谢你  "嘀嗒糖侠"
Thank you, Tic Tac Man.

91
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,540
嘀嗒  嘀嗒  嘀嗒
Tic Tac, Tic Tac, Tic Tacs.

92
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,070
这是《古兰经》中的一段文字
It's a passage from the Suras.

93
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,680
"然后尤瑟夫对囚犯说
"And Yusef said to the prisoner:

94
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,160
"求你在主面前想起我"
'Remember me in the presence of your lord.'

95
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,850
"但是撒旦使他忘记了这件事"
"But Satan made him forget,"

96
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,580
"于是尤瑟夫在监狱里被关了很多年"
"And Yusef stayed in prison for several years."

97
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,330
这种笔迹很古怪
The calligraphy is unusual,

98
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,760
间隔和组成的形状
the spacing, the way it's shaped,

99
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,170
像是车轮上的辐条
like, like spokes on a wheel.

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,830
就像萨那的中心
Like the center of Sana'a.

101
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,890
你觉得他弟弟送来了一幅地图吗
You think his brother sent us a map?

102
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,280
这里有一个红点
There's a red dot

103
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,730
表明他所在的地方
dotting the "I",

104
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,000
不管这是哪里
and whatever this is here.

105
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,740
他想告诉我们一个位置
He's trying to give us a location.

106
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,100
什么的位置
A location for what?

107
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,300
我唯一能想到的
The only thing I can think of

108
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,650
就是当他今晚越狱之时
is where we're supposed to meet him

109
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,450
期望和我们会合的地方
when the escape goes down tonight.

110
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,260
现在你弟弟的事我不掺和了
Your brother is your business now.

111
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,110
今晚我得和家人赶在机场关闭前
I have to get my family on a flight tonight

112
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,750
一起上飞机
before the airport shuts down.

113
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
等等
Hold up.

114
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,610
我们也需要机票  我们三个人
We need tickets, too, three of them.

115
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,500
我  迈克尔  钞票哥
One for me, one for Michael, one for C.

116
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,870
如果我还能搞到机票  也会给这些孩子
If I'm getting anybody any tickets it's these kids,

117
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,240
不会给你唯利是图的弟弟
not your mercenary brother.

118
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,200
没有钱  你要怎么买到那些机票
And how are you going to do that without any money?

119
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,850
你要拿这些孩子的自由威胁我  是吗
You're holding these kids' freedom over my head; is that it?

120
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,830
希巴  只要你帮我买到那些机票
Sheba, you get me those plane tickets,

121
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,470
我会支付所有孩子的机票费用
and I'll pay for every single one of these kids

122
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,890
让他们逃出这个国家
to get out of this country.

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,080
直觉告诉我  不管怎样你都会这么做
Something tells me that's what you want to do anyhow.

124
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,410
说话可要小心哦
Careful.

125
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,700
你这是在"责备"我良心未泯
You're accusing me of having a heart.

126
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,080
走开  都走开
Out of my way. Get out of my way.

127
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,110
怎么  你想走吗
What, you want to go?

128
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,340
冷静点
Keep it together.

129
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,440
你必须万事俱备了我才能冷静
You got to have it together to keep it together.

130
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,900
在经历了这么长时间的炮击后
One of those hits us now,

131
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,550
终于有一颗炮弹击中我们这了  我发誓...
after all this time, I swear to God... ‭

132
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,170
九个小时
Nine hours.

133
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,290
我们九个小时后就能离开  你明白吗
Nine hours till we get out, you understand?

134
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,710
就在凌晨1点
It's 1:00 A.M.

135
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,450
我们熬过今天  就能逃出监狱了
We get through today and we're on the bricks.

136
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,700
那又怎样
And then what?

137
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,650
那是四年前了
It was four years ago.

138
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,890
我们的全部计划  护照  还有那家店
All of our plans, the passports, the shop,

139
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,560
现在可能全都埋在废墟下了
everything is probably under rubble by now.

140
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,460
我找到人来处理这件事了
I got someone on it.

141
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,060
什么  就那个捡你纸飞机的孩子吗
What, the kid you throw planes to?

142
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,630
不是
No.

143
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,960
我说的是这世界上我唯一信任的人
I'm talking about the only person I trust in the world

144
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,800
就和我信任你一样
as much as I trust you.

145
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,580
就是这里了  地图上的那个点
So, this is it, the spot on the map.

146
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,290
原主人说他四年前
The owner says he sold the auto shop

147
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,550
把这家汽修店卖给了一个美国人
to an American four years ago

148
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,190
那之后就没见过他了
and hasn't seen him since.

149
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,290
你知道那个美国人是迈克尔  对吧
You know that American was Michael, right?

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,590
问题是他用这个地方做什么呢
Question is what was he using this place for.

151
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,930
谋划他的越狱
Planning his escape.

152
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,000
看起来他原定的撤退点
It looks like his original exfil point

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,660
是在北面边界
was at the northern border.

154
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,710
现在可没法那么做了
Won't be doing that now.

155
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,960
那已是ISIL恐怖组织的地盘了
It's ISIL territory.

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,620
模板  护照照片
Mock-ups, passport photos,

157
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,790
伪装
disguises.

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,170
不过看起来他打算不只把自己弄出来
But it looks like he just wasn't planning on getting himself out.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,940
他还要把阿布·拉马尔弄出来
He was getting Abu Ramal out.

160
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,810
这家伙是一切文明发展的敌人  老林
This guy's the enemy of everything that's civilized, Linc.

161
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,560
这就回到我真正的问题上了
That brings me to my real question.

162
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,790
我们到底是在帮谁越狱
Who in the hell are we breaking out?

163
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,390
是迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Is it Michael Scofield

164
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,010
还是卡尼尔·乌提斯
or Kaniel Outis?

{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}把异教徒围起来

166
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,290
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}把离经叛道者也围起来

167
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,150
到底怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

168
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,790
拉马尔的人要执行伊斯兰教教法
Ramal's men are gonna institute Sharia law.

169
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,520
而那个混蛋却打算作壁上观
And that son of a bitch himself is gonna enjoy the show.

170
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,480
我们只要低着头  熬过这关
We just have to keep our heads down and get through this

171
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,940
今晚就能逃出去了
so we can get out tonight.

172
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,590
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}把他们单独分离出来
Separate them.

173
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,470
{\an2}{\pos(192,212)}那些玷污了我们土地的同性恋  抓住他们

174
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,980
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}他们必须为其罪行受罚

175
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,250
不  不  别让他们抓我走
No. No, don't let them take me!

176
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,620
不
No! ‭

177
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,430
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}这人是离经叛道者吗

178
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,380
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}这人是离经叛道者吗

179
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,270
-对不起  -不
- Sorry. - ‭No!

180
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,180
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}当一个男人

181
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,470

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,130
拉马尔
Ramal!

184
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,190
狗杂种  放了他
You bastard! Just let him go.

185
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,440
拉马尔
Ramal!

186
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,190
你在做什么
What are you doing?

187
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,410
-别管这事  -不行
- Stay out of this. - ‭No.

188
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,640
今晚就要越狱
The escape is tonight.

189
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,400
如果你想出去  你需要我  你还需要他
If you want to get out, you need me and you need him.

190
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,890
说重点
Get to the point.

191
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,690
放了他  拉马尔
Let him go, Ramal.

192
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,840
那我来
Then I'll do it.

193
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,270
别碰他
Do not touch him.

194
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,840
一边去  小子
Get back, dog!

195
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,490
这所监狱里严禁杀人  明白了吗
There will be no killing in this prison.... Understand?

196
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,440
他以前就试着联系过她
He's tried to contact her before.

197
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,940
唯一不同的是这次他成功了
Only difference is he succeeded this time.

198
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,380
走了那个男孩这步棋  高明
It's smart... going through the boy.

199
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,730
问一个问题
Ask a question?

200
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,820
我们为什么不跟这个女人来硬的呢
Why are we pulling our punches with this woman?

201
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,820
几天前姐被派去她家
I got sent to her house a couple of days ago,

202
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,570
才准备大开杀戒  却在姐杀她前
started spilling blood, but I'm just supposed to stop

203
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,370
给姐喊停了
before I start spilling hers.

204
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,730
这是怎么回事
How's that work?

205
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,660
你会习惯波塞冬的游戏规则的
You'll get used to Poseidon's game.

206
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,730
这一切就是一盘棋
It's all chess.

207
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,680
就是一场秀
It's a performance.

208
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,540
一场设计好  让乌提斯联系她的表演
A performance designed to make Outis reach out to her.

209
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,080
现在我们要做的就是窃听
Now all we got to do is listen in,

210
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,050
弄清他葫芦里到底卖的什么药
find out what his plans are.

211
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,760
而且她还没有察觉
And she doesn't know it.

212
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,120
她就是能帮我们顺藤摸瓜的人
She's the one that's going to lead us to him.

213
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,020
他们说我上午可以出院了
They said I can go in the morning.

214
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,200
你的股动脉被切断了
Your femoral artery was severed.

215
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
这可不是通常那种站起来就能没事走人的伤
That's not something you usually just get up and walk away from.

216
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,330
他们跟我说可以了
Hey, they gave me the okay.

217
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,420
他们才是主治医生  而不是你
They're the doctors on this one, not you.

218
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,640
而且我在这都快疯了  所以我要出院
And I'm going full mental in here, so I'm gonna go.

219
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,240
好吧  这样如何
Okay. How about this?

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,210
等你真能出院时
When you are discharged,

221
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,870
我们去你父母的湖畔小屋怎么样
why don't we go up to your parents' lake house?

222
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,240
我和麦克一起接上你就出发
I'll just pick you up with Mike and we'll go.

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,430
你不想在家里待着  对不对
You don't want to be in the house, do you?

224
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,240
有人闯进你家
Somebody comes into your house

225
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,430
朝你丈夫开枪  而且仍然逍遥法外
and shoots up your husband and they're still out there.

226
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,240
不想
No.

227
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,140
怎么了
‭What?

228
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,850
没什么  就是你下定决心的时候
No, it's just something you do with your nose

229
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,240
会动鼻子
when you're determined.

230
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,780
-会动鼻子吗  -很难察觉
- With my nose? - ‭It's subtle.

231
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,040
-真的很难察觉  -最好如此
- I mean, it's really subtle. - Better be.

232
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,260
你的脸真精致
The face is amazing.

233
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,060
我是说
I mean,

234
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,460
最细微的细节  哪怕失之毫厘
the tiniest detail, less than a millimeter,

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,560
也会差之千里
differentiates everything.

236
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,580
同一种表情在一个人的脸上可以是
An emotion on one person can be...

237
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,930
非常心神不安的
so troubled

238
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,710
而在另一个人脸上
and on another...

239
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,240
却如此美丽动人
...so beautiful.

240
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,670
你不是在动什么坏主意吧  奈斯先生
You're not trying to get somewhere, are you, Mr. Ness?

241
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,640
事实上
Yes, actually,

242
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,260
还真是
I am.

243
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,620
{\an2}手机已锁

244
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,250
{\an2}手机已解锁

245
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,830
你好啊
Hello there.

246
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
我们是一伙的  莎拉
I come as a compatriot, Sara.

247
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,450
你给我闪开  不然我就喊了
Get out of my way or I'll scream.

248
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,630
我最不希望那样了
Last thing I want.

249
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,410
不妨先听听我说的
For your information,

250
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,410
我知道卡尼尔·乌提斯的事
I know about Kaniel Outis.

251
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,240
说说你都知道什么
Tell me what you know.

252
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,880
我从福克斯河监狱刑满释放那天
The day I hit the bricks from Fox River,

253
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,720
有个叫乌提斯的人
someone named Outis,

254
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,460
大发善心
out of the goodness of their soul,

255
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,340
主动捐给我这个新式义肢
unsolicited, pays for this modern prosthesis.

256
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,420
你说什么
What's that?

257
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,710
值一百万美元吗
A million bucks?

258
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,670
为什么会有人对我这种卑鄙小人倾囊相助呢
Why would anyone come out of a pocket for a wretch like me,

259
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,710
一分都不可能  更别说一百万了
a penny, much less a million bucks?

260
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,780
如果你是来找我要答案的话  我无可奉告
Yeah, if you're coming to me for answers, I don't have any.

261
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,260
我找过答案了  莎拉医生
Oh, I went looking for answers, Doc Sara.

262
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,170
我在网上查询了乌提斯这个人
I looked up Outis on the Interwebs.

263
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,440
结果出现了你已故前夫的脸
Whose face comes up but your dead ex-husband's,

264
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,110
看着生龙活虎着呢
looking very much alive.

265
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,100
拉撒路死而复生了
Lazarus arisen from the dead.

266
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,100
{\an8}{\pos(190.789,228)}[拉撒路  在圣经约翰福音中因病而死
最后被耶稣复活]

267
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,750
他是不是想拉我们去做什么事
He's drawing us into something, isn't he?

268
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,800
他是不是想要什么东西
He wants something, doesn't he?

269
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,060
你要是再接近我或是我的家人  我就杀了你
Come near me or my family again, I will kill you.

270
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,270
我们最好站在同一战线上  莎拉
Better to have me on your side, Sara.

271
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,340
我们可以一起解决的
We can figure this out together.

272
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,650
我们都听说了外面的战争
We have all heard the war outside.

273
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,360
但是就算只在高墙之内
But even if it is just within these walls,

274
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,020
这个国家的法律仍然健在
the law of the land is still in place.

275
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,610
真主之法必然取代这腐朽之国的法律
The law of God supersedes the law of this corrupt land.

276
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,210
我们不会再退化回动物
We will not be reduced to animals.

277
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,850
你还信任他  真是不可思议
Amazing you still trust him.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,550
他会利用你越狱  然后就甩了你
He will use you for the escape and he will leave you.

279
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,530
没有人要越狱
No one's escaping.

280
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,860
你是什么人
Who are you?

281
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,020
这个监狱里最了解你朋友的人
A man who knows your friend there more than anyone in this prison.

282
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,740
我跟他一起关禁闭好多年
I was in solitary with him for years.

283
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,380
我也是
Yeah, so was I.

284
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,190
但你没被关过他对面的禁闭室
But not in the cell across from him.

285
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,190
他跟我说过越狱的事情
He told me about the escape.

286
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,790
-我们必须联手  -不行
- We have to work together. - ‭No.

287
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,610
他曾试图说服我跟他一起越狱
Tried to convince me to go with him,

288
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,520
只有我们两个人
just the two of us.

289
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,090
但是我拒绝了他
But I told him no.

290
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,060
我是不会离开我兄弟的
I would not leave my brother.

291
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,090
我体内仍流淌着军人的血
That is the Army in me,

292
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,320
也流淌着基督徒的血
the Christian in me.

293
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,810
他是个机会主义者
He is an opportunist.

294
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,230
他会利用任何他所需要的人
He will use whoever he needs.

295
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,540
我知道他已跟你说过越狱的事了
He has told you something about the escape. I know he has.

296
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,660
你跟他在一个牢房里  你
You were in the cell with him. You.

297
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,360
你告诉我  我就能帮你
You tell me, so I can help you,

298
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,140
赶在他利用你把那个大魔头弄出监狱
before he uses you to get that devil out

299
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,180
却把我们留在这里等死之前
and we are all left here to die.

300
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,630
我们需要护照  奥玛  你能帮我们吗
We need passports, Omar. You think you can help us?

301
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
等等  我们能信得过这家伙吗
Hold on. We're gonna trust this guy?

302
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,280
他可是偷我护照在先的人
He's the one who stole my passport in the first place.

303
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,160
那可是诚信交易  朋友
It was honest bargaining, friend.

304
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,290
我什么都没得到
I took nothing.

305
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,370
再说  你的护照早没了
Besides, your passport is long gone,

306
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,850
我估计现在已经远在天边了
somewhere far overseas by now, I bet.

307
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,680
如果你想  我可以让办假证的再给你弄个
If you want, um, I can have the forgers make you another.

308
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,960
让你制作我自己的假护照吗
My own fake passport coming from you?

309
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,220
你还有别的选择吗
You have another option?

310
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,850
快决定  我要离开这座城市了
Quick. I'm leaving the city.

311
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,630
这里已经没有地方是安全的了
Nowhere is safe anymore.

312
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,680
我需要两个护照  一个给我的
I need two passports. One for me,

313
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,840
一个给我弟弟的  迈克尔·斯科菲尔德

314
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,000
每个护照预付一千美元
$1,000 U.S. each, deposit.

315
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,310
取货的时候每个再付一千美元
$1,000 U.S. when you pick them up.

316
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,060
钞票哥
C?

317
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,610
如果你敢耍我  我就杀了你
You screw with me and I'll kill you.

318
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,230
如果我耍你  我才不会留下等你来杀
I screw you, I won't be around for you to kill me.

319
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,630
今晚十一点  希巴
11 tonight, Sheba.

320
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,090
护照会准备好的
Passports will be ready.

321
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,080
那我们就得分头行动了
That means we're gonna have to split up.

322
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,260
你们俩去拿护照
You two get the passports,

323
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,290
我和这位朋友一起去发电厂
and I'll go with our friend here to the power plant

324
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,620
搞定停电熄灯的活儿
and kill the lights.

325
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,960
然后我们救迈克尔出来
And we get Michael out.

326
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,790
美国国务院的一位发言人称
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said

327
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,620
也门首都日趋沦陷
the capital of Yemen grows ever closer to collapse

328
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,010
萨那落入ISIL激进分子手中
and it's only a matter of time

329
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,110
只是时间问题罢了
until Sana'a's fallen to the hands of ISIL radicals,

330
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,060
预计最快明天就会彻底沦陷
with the total collapse coming as soon as tomorrow.

对  你...
Yeah. You, um...

336

你也能修手机  对吗
you fix phones, too, right?

337

对
Yeah.

339
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,790
有可能帮我找出是谁干的吗
Is there any chance you can help me figure out who?

不带其他人
No one else.

346
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,460
他是骗子  你最好别跟他扯上任何关系
He's a liar. You don't want anything to do with him.

347
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,520

I don't know. Christian, Army.

348
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,200
-我觉得挺靠谱  -那他有没有告诉你
- Seems pretty upfront to me. -Did he happen to tell you

349
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,720
他和他兄弟在他们的安检哨卡
about some of the arrests he and his brother made

350
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,740
-抓的那些人呢  -没  只顾着说你了
- at their security checkpoint?  - No, focused on you.

351
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,830
他们专抓一种人  女人
They had a specialty: women.

352
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,870
尸段遍布也门
Body parts strewn around Yemen.

353
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,220
这就是他们被关进来的原因
That's why they're here.

354
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,940
戴着十字架是一回事
Wearing a cross is one thing.

355
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,610
-以此为生就是另一回事了  -好吧  行了
- Living by it is another. - All right, okay, sure.

356
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,660
只要你能让我相信
Just promise me I can trust you,

357
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,700
你能保证我们今晚仍会行动就行
that we're still doing this tonight.

358
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,260
我们一起合作这么多年
All these years we've been working together,

359
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,940
你一直都能信任我
you've been able to trust me the whole time.

360
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,840
过去四年都被关在洞里  在黑暗中生活
Last four years in the hole, sitting in the dark,

361
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,740
甚至连个人声都听不到  我可说不准
I couldn't even hear a voice. I don't know.

362
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,480
说不定有什么变数或者...
Maybe something's changed or...

363
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,950
没有变数
Nothing's changed.

364
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,720
波塞冬把我们安排到这里去救拉马尔
Poseidon put us in here to get Ramal out,

365
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,920
但他又抛弃了我们
but then he abandoned us.

366
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,340
拉马尔是波塞冬的人  不是我们的
Ramal is Poseidon's guy, not ours.

367
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,340
-他是个禽兽  -你最好小心说话
- He's an animal. - I suggest you watch your mouth.

368
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,300
他们有人懂英语
Some of these guys speak English.

369
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,610
我们为什么还要把他弄出去
Why are we still getting him out?

370
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,220
我们只是跟他说要救他出去
We're telling him we're getting him out.

371
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,410
两者是有区别的
There's a difference.

372
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,070
我们必须装作跟他一伙  直到不需要他为止
We got to act like we're on his side until the moment we're not.

373
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,690
但万一你也是装作跟我一伙
But what if you're acting like you're on my side

374
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,570
直到不需要我为止呢
till the moment you're not?

375
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,980
你太多心了
You are getting paranoid.

376
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,390
换做把你关四年禁闭  你也会这样
Yeah, well, four years in the box is gonna do that to you.

377
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,640
我不会抛下你的
I'm not leaving you behind.

378
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,820
-你是我的得力干将  -这我可不确定
- You're my whip hand. - I don't know that.

379
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,580
我怎么确信我是你的得力干将呢
How do I know I'm your whip hand?

380
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,960
-之后你会明白的  -我现在就要明白
- You'll understand later. - I want to understand now.

381
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,480
好吗
Okay?

382
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,320
把你的手放开
Get your hands off me.

383
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,380
现在就给我答案  我是认真的
Answers, now. I'm serious.

384
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,760
好吧
Okay.

385
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,230
我叫你别碰我
I said don't touch me!

386
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,050
好吧
Okay.

387
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,050
好吧  这才像话
Okay, that's fair.

388
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,640
你非得这样  对吧
You want any of this?

389
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,280
你还想被关到洞里去吗
You want the hole again, huh?

390
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
不  我们没事
No, we're good.

391
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,860
不
No.

392
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,920
我们没事
We're good.

393
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,910
我们没事才怪
We're far from good.

394
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,560
等到明天  我们就不用再担心他了
By tomorrow, we won't have to worry about him.

Understand?

正当光荣革命即将开始之际

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,410
我不是来讨论政治的  只是拿护照
I'm not here for political discussion, just passports.

405
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,010
先交钱
Money first.

406
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,740
先看护照
Passports first.

407

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,590
你能解释得了为何你会让那人杀了我吗
Can you explain why you were going to let that man kill me?

411
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,380
我不会让他杀了你的
I wouldn't have let him kill you.

412
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,370
看来你和ISIL的老大确实是好基友

Didn't know you participated in these conversations, Ja.

我只谈论有意思的话题
Only when they're interesting.

415
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,190
不过通常都没意思
And they're usually not.

416
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,740
随你信不信
There are people in my government,

417
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,310
我政府里有人因为
believe it or not, who want that man out

418
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,680
他们自己复杂的外交政策而要救那人出狱
for their own convoluted foreign policy over here.

419
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,040
这就是我和维普被派来做的差事
That's the job Whip and I were sent here to do.

420
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,630
但因为某些原因  我们被抛弃了
But for some reason, we were betrayed.

421
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,610
也就是说这次越狱没有拉马尔的份了
Which means we're getting out without Ramal.

422
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,290
你们每个人都是计划中重要的一环
And every one of you is crucial to that plan.

423
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,400
怎么讲
How?

424
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,590
你的整个越狱计划早已酝酿成形
Your whole escape's already wired.

425

灯一熄  你就越过高墙
Lights out, you're over the wall.

426
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,830
你还要我这样的韩国瘾君子做什么
What do you need a Korean junkie like me for?

427
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,720
你的意思其实是韩国天才吧
Korean genius, you mean.

428
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,480
翻越那堵高墙只是开始
Getting over that wall is just the start.

429
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,420
一旦完成
Once that happens,

430
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,340
就有些只有你能做到的事
there are things only you can do.

431
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,450
回到重点上来  你打了我
Back on point: you hit me.

432
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,520
你要我证明我和你一伙  而不是拉马尔
You wanted proof that I sided with you and not Ramal.

433
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,020
打烂我的嘴唇算什么证明
And splitting my lip does that how?

434
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,470
狗娘养的卡尼尔·乌提斯就是爱演  对不对
Son of a bitch Kaniel Outis keeps playing, doesn't he?

435
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,530
我的手表在哪
Where is my watch?

436
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,420
我不知道你在说些什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

437
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,040
你不知道吗
You don't?

438
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,440
等我找到表了
I'm going to break you in half

439
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,460
我要把你劈成两半
when I find that watch, you know?

440
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,700
把这翻个底朝天
Toss the cell.

441
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,950
表不在这
It's not here.

442
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,180
下令整个监狱实行一级防范禁闭
Order a lockdown of the whole prison.

443
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,830
不允许任何人走出牢房一步
No one gets out of their cells

444
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,860
直到找到那块表为止
until that watch is found!

{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}回你牢房里去

449
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,240
我说过  拉马尔哪也去不了
I told you, Ramal's not going anywhere.

450
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,290
只有我们能逃出去
Only we are.

451
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,060
我们会跟其他人一样被锁在自己的囚室里
We're gonna be locked in our box just like the rest of them,

452
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,900
然而只有我们的囚室能逃出去
only our box has a way out.

453
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,160
等两个小时以后  那些灯都灭了
And in two hours when those lights go black,

454
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,080
我们会像幽灵一样从这里消失不见
we're gonna disappear from this place like ghosts.

455
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,780
随便吧
Yeah, all right.

456
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,890
希巴
Sheba!

457
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,110
跟你一伙的都是些什么人
Who are these men you work with?

458
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,790
他们配不上你
They're beneath you.

459
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,470
你才配不上我
You're beneath me.

460
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,560
伤害你我也心痛
It pains me to hurt you,

461
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,130
但良家妇女就得恪守妇道
but a good woman is a humble woman.

462
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,630
给我记住了
Remember that.

463
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,940
那些人是谁
Who are these men?

464
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,220
不重要了
Doesn't matter.

465
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,710
反正他们要离开了
They're leaving.

466
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,920
坏人不是我
I am not the bad guy here.

467
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,520
你我有过一段情
You and I have a history.

468
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,080
上小学时我曾是何等地宠爱你
How I doted on you in grade school,

469
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,790
我又曾是如何等了又等
how I waited and I waited.

470
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,330
你没有等
You did not wait.

471
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,160
你只想强奸我
You tried to rape me!

472
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,950
求你了
Please.

473
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
行行好  松开我
Please. Please untie me...

474
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,150
这样我就可以让你再瞎一只眼
...so I can take your other eye.

我在找我那一部被一个女人偷走的手机
I'm looking for a cell phone that a woman stole from me.

479
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,550
她长这样  对吧
She looks like this?

480
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,760
不  我帮不了你
No, can't help you.

481
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,860
帮不了  还是不愿帮
Can't... or won't?

482
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,410
抱歉  只不过店里有规矩
Sorry. Store policy, that's all.

我再问一次
‭Let's go again.

Have you seen her? ‭

见过  见过
Yes. Yes!

489
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,740
她刚来过  大概十分钟前吧
She was here, like, ten minutes ago.

490
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,620
说她手机被黑了  想知道是谁干的
Said her phone was hacked and wanted to know who did it.

491
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,740
她现在知道了  不是吗
And now she knows, doesn't she?

492
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,910
她给我们下了套
She baited us.

493
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,620
是死胡同
Dead end.

494
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,800
波塞冬有没有可能让我们直接杀了她
Any chance Poseidon'll just let us kill her?

495
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,390
将来也许会吧
It might come to that.

496
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,980
等我们出去了  你会去哪里
We get out, where are you going?

497
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,460
回我沙发上
Back to my couch.

498
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,620
我首尔的沙发上
My couch in Seoul,

499
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,010
那里的墙是我的

没人能找我麻烦

我要去当跳台滑雪运动员
I'm going to be a ski jumper.

506
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,120
你从没见过雪  对吧
You've never seen snow, have you?

507
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,980
所以才选那里
That's the point.

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,260

Everything in my life till now in this country--

炎热  仇恨  从不下雪的天
the heat, the hate, the skies that never snow.

510
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,950
你所谈论的那种"尘世"
You talk about the world.

511
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,120
我想在那个世界的另一边[过另一种生活]

Oh, give me one sec. Sorry.

喂
Hello?

519
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,130
你好  我是捷普数码店的布莱恩
Hi. This is Brian at Jep's.

520
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,550
我给你激活新手机时记下了你的号码
I got this number when I activated your new phone.

521
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,110
你一直没回来
You never came back.

522
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,940
很抱歉  我想我不会回去了
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm going to.

523
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,060
好吧  我只想告诉你
Well, okay, I just want to let you know

524
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,270
我发现了是谁在黑你的手机
that I figured out who was hacking your phone.

525
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,440
是谁
Who?

526
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,300
是你...  黑了你自己的手机
You... hacked your own phone.

527
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,320
你在说些什么
What are you talking about?

528
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,290
你的拇指指纹就是秘钥  对吧
Your thumbprint is your password, right?

529
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,660
那个黑你手机的人用了你的指纹
Well, whoever hacked your phone used your thumbprint,

530
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,500
所以说  除非你大拇指丢了
so, unless you're missing a thumb,

531
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,080
否则就是你自己
that's you.

532
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,180
我不知道你惹了什么麻烦
I don't know what you're messed up in,

533
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,120
但换做是我  我一定会多加小心了
but I'd watch your back...

534
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,460
你在医院的时候
When you were in the hospital,

535
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,880
袭击我们的女人跟她的同伙又回来了
the woman who attacked us came back with her partner.

536
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,550
什么
What?

537
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,260
他们利用我的手机跟踪了我
They tracked me down using my cell phone,

538
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,850
所以我把手机拿去捷普数码店
so I brought it to Jep's

539
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,560
想找出他们的幕后老板是谁
to try and figure out who they were working for.

540
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,420
等等  莎拉  这事明摆着由警方负责
Wait. Sara, this has police written all over it.

541
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,830
警方至今毫无进展
Police haven't been able to do a thing.

542
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,550
所以呢  你就去了捷普数码店
So, what? You went to Jep's Electronics

543
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,890
试图用反侦察的滥招数搞定吗
in some hackneyed attempt at counter-espionage?

544
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,590
抱歉  抱歉  只是...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...

545
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,980
我明白你有点不知所措
I get you don't know where to turn,

546
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,340
但这也是我的事
but I got a stake in this, too.

547
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,360
好吧  这可事关我的老婆和儿子
‭Okay? This is my wife, my son.

548
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,840
你想报复这帮家伙吗
You want to get back at these guys?

549
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
那就去大学
The university.

550
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,130
我是说  那里有资源
I mean, it has real resources,

551
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,190
有计算机科学系
their Computer Sciences Department.

552
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,420
手机的事到此为止  我会把它留在捷普
The phone's done. It's gonna stay at Jep's.

553
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,450
所以你的计划就是  逃避现实吗
So that's your plan-- just bury your head in the sand?

554
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,700
不
No.

555
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,820
不  我这些年学到了
No, I've learned over the years

556
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,950
逃避是最坏的选择  谢谢你了
that's exactly what you don't do. Thank you.

557
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,460
你是哪位
Which one's this?

558
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,460
你在卫生间里搭讪的那位
The one you accosted in a bathroom.

559
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,470
那可不是搭讪  亲爱的
That wasn't accostment, honey.

560
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,460
我搞清楚了一些有关于
I've learned some things

561
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,090
我们两个都在找的那个人的事
about who it is we're apparently both looking for?

562
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,400
但我需要知道你有决心坚持到底
But I need to know that you're willing to go the distance.

563
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,670
我最有决心了  小美人儿
I'm made of the distance, honeysuckle.

564
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,600
我就是决心的化身
I am the distance.

565
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,370
很好
Good.

566
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,740
因为你需要替我去和保罗·凯勒曼聊聊
Because you're gonna have a conversation with Paul Kellerman for me.

567
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,630
不会吧  凯勒曼是幕后主使吗
Bull. Kellerman's behind this?

568
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,720
你得去查清楚这到底是怎么回事
And you are gonna get every shred of information you can

569
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,660
不要放过任何蛛丝马迹
about what's really going on.

570
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,190
十五分钟
15 minutes.

571
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,040
我只是想告诉你  这次是我自己打脸了
I'm soiling myself here, just so you know.

572
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,240
听着  我只说这一件事  好吗
Look, I'm just gonna say one thing, okay?

573
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,570
你就像我的兄弟
You're like a brother to me,

574
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,760
就像一位老大哥一样
like an older brother.

575
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,900
-我不是个好大哥  -确实
- I'm not much of a brother. - ‭Sure.

576
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,670
但重点是之前我一个兄弟都没
Point is that I had zero, nobody,

577
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,200
直到你拉我入伙
till you recruited me.

578
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,800
把我从奥沙克监狱救出来的你
When you pulled me out of that prison in the Ozarks,

579
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,040
作风正派
you had integrity.

580
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,210
当然  当时我知道那是中情局的差事
I know we were doing CIA work, sure,

581
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,370
救他们要的人出去啊什么的
you know, pulling their people out,

582
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,760
但重要的是我们并肩作战
but it was about you and me,

583
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,300
我们把性命都托付给对方
and having each other's back.

584
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,210
之前从哥伦比亚越狱那次也一样
And it didn't matter if you were Ramon Cadena

585
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,050
就算你化名罗曼·卡德纳  我也不在乎
when we did the Colombian break,

586
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,390
还有  阿萨夫...
or, you know Asaf...

587
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,820
他叫什么来着
What was his name?

588
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,100
随便吧  就是埃及那次
Whatever. The one in Egypt.

589
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,620
你还是那个你
You were still you.

590
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
这次也一样
And it's the same with this one.

591
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,660
我们让你以卡尼尔·乌提斯的身份
You know, we trump you up as Kaniel Outis,

592
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,610
伪装成国际恐怖分子
big international terrorist.

593
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,020
那只是个名字
It's just a name,

594
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,450
只是张罪行累累的"狼皮"  一个关进监狱的借口
it's just a rap sheet, it's a way to get you locked up.

595
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,000
对吧
Right?

596
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,660
我想问你的是...
I guess what I'm asking you is did...

597
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,560
你被单独监禁时是不是发生了什么事
did something happen to you while you were in solitary?

598
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,220
那时你是否真相信自己是卡尼尔·乌提斯了
Did you become Kaniel Outis in there in your head?

599
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,460
现在你是不是真想把拉马尔救出去
Do you now want Ramal out after all?

600
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,650
我告诉过你了  我们不管拉马尔了
I already told you Ramal is out of the picture.

601
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,040
你是说了  但有件小事...
Yeah, you said that, but one small thing...

602
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,880
计划是我们从上面那个洞口上去
We go up through that hole,

603
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,930
从囚区上面绕着走
and then we skirt above the block.

604
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,010
走到拉马尔囚室正上方  不是吗
Goes right above Ramal's cell, doesn't it?

605
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,840
敲掉几块砖
Knock out a couple tiles,

606
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,390
他就跟我们一起跑了  对吧
he joins the escape, doesn't he?

607
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,270
刚才我们吵完架后  你跟他悄悄说了什么
What did you whisper to him in that moment after the fight?

608
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,080
你跟他说悄悄话了  说了什么
