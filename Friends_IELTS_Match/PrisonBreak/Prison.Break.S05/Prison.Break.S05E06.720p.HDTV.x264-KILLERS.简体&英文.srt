奥马尔比我们更惨
Not as desperate as Omar right now.

166
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,220
他现在惹了最不该惹的人  就是维普
If there's one man you don't want to get on the wrong side of, it's Whip.

167
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,460
这句话也适用于你  迈克尔

我感觉那孩子觉得你背叛了他

我一害怕  就会做错选择
When I'm scared, I make poor choices.

184
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,960

听着  我不希望保罗是白白牺牲

但我们得用全新的视角看这个事件

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,610
该死的电脑摄像头
Blasted computer camera thing.

318
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,150
谁造的这鬼玩意儿
Who makes these things?

319
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,560
好了  我看见你了
All right, I see you.

320
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,390
快点  把这个给我解开
Come on, hurry. Get this off of me.

321
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,800
手别动
Hold your hand still.

322
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,830
赶紧动手吧
Just do it already.

323
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,650
你想保持这样吗
Do you want to stay like this?

324
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,970
我们能给你松开是你走了运
You're lucky we cut you loose.

325
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,480
杀了阿布·拉马尔的那些人
The men who killed Abu Ramal,

326
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,700
正在离开萨那  沿80号高速向西行
leaving Sana'a, heading west on Highway 80.

327
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,370
-好的  -80号高速
- Okay. - Highway 80.

328
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,440
我们现在就出发
We're leaving now.

329
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,010
-我也要去  -不
- I'm coming, too. - ‭No.

330
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,430
这不再是你的战斗了
This is not your fight anymore.

331
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,150
明白吗
Understand?

332
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,160
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}出来  快滚出来

333
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,520
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}别  求你了

334
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,580
你知道吗  我已经四年没用过空调了
You know it's been four years since I've had air conditioning?

335
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,500
我受够了炎热
I'm done with the heat.

336
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,660
我有点喜欢这里了
Kind of like it out here.

337
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,520
没有高墙
No walls.

338
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,640
没有高墙  这跟墙无关
No walls, okay? Ain't about walls.

339
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,010
在我看来  你知道你在这世上最需要什么吗
My opinion, you know what you need more than anything else in the world?

340
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,790
笑口常开
Got to laugh more.

341
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,350
他要是想笑
If he wants to laugh,

342
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,020
费阿刻斯正是该去的地方
Phaeacia's the place.

343
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,120
我一直想带上希巴
I always wanted to bring Sheba;

344
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,750
让她见见那里的人
for her to see the people.

345
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,900
没有科技  政治  或者现代的荒唐事
No technology, no politics, no modern nonsense.

346
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,450
他们知道该如何享受生活
They know how to enjoy life.

347
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,070
没有科技吗
No technology?

348
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,620
佛莱迪·摩克瑞都黑不进去
Freddie Mercury here couldn't hack it.

349
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,800
佛莱迪·摩克瑞
Freddie Mercury?

350
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,120
我能黑进去
I could hack it.

351
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,210
手机发明前我也活得好好的
I was alive before cell phones.

352
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,430
比起药片  你对手机屏幕
You're more addicted to that screen

353
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,630
更上瘾  这说明了些问题
than you are to them pills, and that is saying something.

354
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,780
准备好
Be ready.

355
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,370
朋友们  我们有麻烦了
My friends. We got problems!

356
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,770
迈克尔  我们得走了
Michael, we got to go!

357
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,190
迈克尔  快走
Michael? Let's go!

358
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,060
我得走了
I got to go.

359
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,000
等一下  让我试试别的办法
Hold on, let me try something else.

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
你现在能看见我吗
Can you see me now?

361
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,850
不能  截个屏
No. Take a screen capture.

362
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,890
截什么
What of?

363
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,940
截屏  快点
A screen capture. Take it.

364
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,200
ISIL恐怖分子正从东面接近
ISIL militants coming from the east.

365
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,180
这应该会变得很有趣
This should get interesting.

366
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,200
别幻想着一发子弹就能让我们摆脱困境
Don't think one bullet is going to get us out of this.

367
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,890
一发子弹  谁的枪会只带一发子弹
One bullet? Who the hell carries a gun with one bullet?

368
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,730
被ISIL组织抓住前打算饮弹自尽的人
The man who would kill himself before being captured by ISIL.

369
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,880
拉近点  放大
Get closer. Zoom in.

370
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,150
停住
Hold on.

371
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,060
这些士兵是怎么找到他们的
These militants, how'd they find them?

372
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,730
见鬼  你在等什么  回击啊
Damnit, what are you waiting for? Shoot back!

373
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,180
我们只有一发子弹
We only got one bullet.

374
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,130
-一发子弹  -正是
- One bullet? - Exactly.

375
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,170
我们要在这玩完了
We're seriously screwed here.

376
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,110
除非我能让这发子弹发挥效力
Unless I can make this one bullet count.

377
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,420
什么
What?

378
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,560
你果然知道怎么发挥子弹效力  孩子
You sure as hell made it count, kid.

379
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,530
真有你的
Hell yeah, you did.

380
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,420
我的天
Oh, my God.

381
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,650
迈克尔
Michael.

382
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,750
他情况不妙  哥
He's in a bad way, Linc.

383
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,950
来更多人了  我们得赶紧离开这
More coming, we got to get the hell out of here!

384
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,450
他们停下来干什么
What are they stopping for?

385
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,580
不知道
Don't know.

386
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,220
我们不能再往前走了
We can't go any further.

387
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,990
我们还能往前走一大段
We can go a lot further.

388
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,560
我们得赶到费阿刻斯
We've got to get to Phaeacia.

389
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,200
没路了  维普
There's no roads, Whip.

390
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,450
路线和地图在奥玛的脑子里
The roads are in Omar's head along with the map.

391
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,190
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

392
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,830
我们的地图已经死了
Our map is dead.

393
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,370
我们得返回
We got to head back.

394
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,550
去哪里
To what?

395
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,450
他说得对
He's right.

396
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,960
没有地图我们会死在这里的
We'll die out there without a map.

397
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,600
那可不一定
We don't know that.

398
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,470
几乎是一定的
We 99% know that.

399
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,080
我猜我们还没脱离险境
Guess we're not out of the woods yet!

400
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,730
我们得甩掉这家伙  无论他是谁
We got to lose this guy, whoever he is!

401
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,460
我们走  快开车  见鬼
Let's go! Then move it, damn it.

402
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,840
现在所有目标方位250
All targets now bearing 2:50.

403
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,790
跟着他们
Stay with them.

404
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,890
不  撤离无人机
No. Pull the drone.

405
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,070
是时候让我们的访客离开了
Time for our visitors to leave.

406
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,440
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

407
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,860
我们刚在也门发现卡尼尔·乌提斯
We find Kaniel Outis in Yemen,

408
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,710
接着叛军就出现要杀他
and then rebels show up to take him out?

409
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,860
我会觉得那只是巧合吗
Was I supposed to think that was a coincidence?

410
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,700
这不是监视  对吗
This isn't surveillance, is it?

411
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,230
这是暗杀
This is assassination.

412
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,480
你在利用我干一些见不得光的勾当  对吗
You're using me for some sort of black work, aren't you?

413
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,560
这是你无需过问的  特里西亚
This is way over your head, Tricia.

414
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,720
别再问问题
Stop asking questions.

415
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,690
如果你还不走  我就要告发你了
If you don't get out of my sight, I will blow the whistle.

416
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,630
马上
Right now.

417
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,070
原本我俩在康涅狄格州的周末会很销魂
Would've been a hell of a weekend in Connecticut.

418
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,830
{\an8}美国国家安全局

419
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,370
这是玩火
It's playing with fire,

420
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,480
像这样私自占用其他部门资源
co-opting other agencies like that.

421
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,250
你觉得她会告发吗
You think she'll talk?

422
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,810
大打国家牌来试探我们吗
Run it up the flagpole?

423
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,510
你想杀了她吗
You got designs on killing her?

424
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,800
我会杀了你
I'll kill you.

425
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,460
别紧张  好吧
Relax, will you?

426
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,620
我已经厌倦追踪乌提斯了
I'm getting pretty tired of chasing Outis.

427
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,360
-总是跟在他屁股后面  -我也是
- Always being behind him. - Me, too.

428
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,210
所以我一直在想
That's why I keep thinking about all that time

429
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,820
他在也门加油站时的事
that he spent in that gas station in Yemen.

430
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,710
ISIL的人对他紧追不舍
ISIL on his tail,

431
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,920
而他却还在那里待着
and he just hangs in there?

432
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,080
他在那里做什么
What was he doing in there?

433
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,140
太阳在我们正上方
The sun is directly overhead.

434
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,310
我分不出哪边是东  哪边是西
I can't tell which way is east, west...

435
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,690
我们得停车
We got to stop.

436
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,600
雅  你手机上有没有指南针
Hey, Ja. You got a compass on that phone?

437
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,940
没信号
No signal.

438
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,570
我们这是在瞎开
We're flying blind.

439
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,760
完全瞎开
Completely blind.

440
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,780
但他不是
But he's not.

441
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,280
我们留下了漂亮的轮胎印让他跟
We're leaving him a beautiful set of tire tracks to follow.

442
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,680
这家伙到底是什么人
Who the hell is this guy?

443
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,960
就是他杀了希德
It's the guy who killed Sid.

444
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,950
这混蛋就是只死咬不放的狗
Son of a bitch is like a dog with a bone, huh?

445
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,810
你杀了人家的精神领袖
You kill someone's spiritual leader,

446
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,420
他们显然会追杀你到天涯海角
they'll follow you to the ends of the Earth, apparently.

447
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,610
他为什么停下了
Why is he stopping?

448
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,380
他在加油
He's refueling.

449
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,540
现在加什么油
Now?

450
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,400
他知道自己的汽油比我们多
He knows he's got more gas than we do.

451
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,950
他只用跟着我们的轮胎印走
All he has to do is follow our tracks.

452
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,760
然后等着我们把油用完
Then wait until we run out.

453
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,810
我们有四个人
There are four of us.

454
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,450
我们可以围住他然后干掉他
Let's just swarm him, take him out.

455
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,690
在这里可不行
Not out here.

456
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,350
人家手里可端着AK-47呢
Not with an AK-47.

457
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,620
我们没法在不挨子弹的情况下
We wouldn't get within a hundred feet of him

458
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,070
跑进他三十米内的地方
without taking a bullet.

459
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,430
那么我们只能智取他
Then we got to outthink him.

460
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,470
你要怎么做  抽他吗
What you gonna do with that, flog him?

461
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,900
把那辆车油箱的油加到这个油箱里
Gonna transfer gas from that tank to this one.

462
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,670
差不多全部的油
Almost all of it.

463
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,080
这没用
It's not gonna help.

464
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,230
可以让这辆车开到费阿刻斯
It's gonna help this one get to Phaeacia.

465
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,920
我们挤在一辆车里吗
We pile into one vehicle?

466
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,730
他的汽油还是比我们多
He still has more gas than us.

467
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,570
他还是可以跟着我们的轮胎印走
He can still follow our tire tracks.

468
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,610
所以我们才要给这辆车留一点汽油
That's why we leave a little bit of gas in that one.

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,050
拿到白石头的
Get the white rock,

475
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,410

Stick out your hand.

He's picking up again.

485
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,780
我不能把你留在这里等死
I'm not leaving you out here to die.

486
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,620
我也没打算死
I have no intention of dying.

487
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,890
总之  你的任务更艰巨
Anyway, you've got the harder job.

488
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,150
你得去找到费阿刻斯的所在地
You've got to find Phaeacia out there somewhere.

489
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,940
留下记号  好让我找到你

我该怎么甩掉这个"尾巴"
Now how the hell am I gonna get out of this?

493

我们根本是无头苍蝇瞎开
We're driving blind.

494
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,250
这周围怎么看都一个样
It's the same damn thing everywhere we look.

495
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,480
这自有它的好处
There's something to be said for that.

496
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,460
充分调动你的感官
Makes you use your senses.

497
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,360
你能别再胡扯了吗
Will you stop talking crap

498
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,620
还是说说大家避之不及的话题
and talk elephant in the room, please?

499
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,130
我们刚丢下了迈克尔
We just left Michael back there.

500
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,530
这样做大错特错了
It's completely wrong.

501
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,480
你最不该跟我说这话
I'm the last guy you want to say that to.

502
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,730
那我们为什么这么做
Well, why are we doing it, then?

503
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,350
因为这是他的决定
Because he said, that's why.

504
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,000
有一件事你不理解
One thing you don't understand.

505
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,820
当迈克尔对抗全世界时
When Michael takes on the world,

506
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,910
输的总是全世界
the world always loses.

507
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,680
我们一直在找
We've been looking the whole time.

508
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,950
这才是问题
That's the problem.

509
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,320
什么
What?

510
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,350

You hear that?

512
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,230
鸟鸣吗
Birds?

513
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,010
不是一般的鸟  是海鸥
Not just birds. Gulls.

514
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,010
据我所知  海鸥对沙漠没兴趣
As far as I know, gulls got no interest in the desert.

515
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,370
它们只喜欢海洋
They only got interest in the sea.

516
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,280
这说明我们离海很近了  只要跟着它们就行
It means we're close. All you got to do is follow them.

517
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,530
或许最终我们还是有"指向标"的
Maybe we got GPS after all.

518
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,800
这里是费阿刻斯吗
Is this Phaeacia?

你开的是奥玛的车  但你不是奥玛
You bring Omar car, but not Omar?

525
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,380
奥玛去了安全的地方
Omar had to go somewhere safe.

526
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,910
因为战争吗
Because of the war?

527
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,520
是的  战争  没错
Yeah, the war. That's right.

528

他让我们把这些东西带给你
He told us to bring this stuff for you.

529
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,760
他还说让你替我们找船
Also said you could arrange a boat for us.

530
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,340

我就告诉过你你会死
I told you you would die.

532
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,050
