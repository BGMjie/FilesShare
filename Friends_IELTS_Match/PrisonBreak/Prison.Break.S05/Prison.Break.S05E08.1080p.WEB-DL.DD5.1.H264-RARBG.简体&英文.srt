我们会把你救出来的
We're gonna get you out of here.

31
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,000
越狱开始了  快走  快走
The escape is on. Go, go, go!

32
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,830
这家伙是谁
Who the hell is the guy?

33
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,940
他是我哥
He's my brother.

34
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,340
你现在不能死  迈克尔  知道吗
Can't die on me now, Michael, you know, you're gonna tell me

35
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,560
你得告诉我为什么我是你的得力干将
why I'm your whip hand.

36
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,210
我们找到迈克尔了
We found Michael.

37
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,300
-他伤得很重  -我得走了
- He's been busted up real bad. - I got to go.

38
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,540
连你自己都不知道会陷入什么麻烦中
You don't know what you'd be walking into.

39
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,320
这不安全
It's not safe.

40
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,370
我不能直视着我儿子的眼睛
I can't look my son in the eye

41
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,470
告诉他我本来可以尽力救他父亲
and tell him that I let his father die,

42
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,050
他还从没见过他父亲呢
a father he's never met.

43
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,520
没想到还能再见到你
Never thought I'd see this face again.

不如你出来吧
How about you step out

47
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,050
把欠的十万还给我们
and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.

48
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,050
-你很伟大  林肯  -好好休息
- There is nobility in you, Lincoln. - You should rest up.

49
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,650
-我们还需要你  -没想到你还会担心
- We're gonna need you. - Didn't know you worried.

50
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,330
该担心的我都会担心
About the right things.

51
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,580
怎么了
What's wrong?

52
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,430

他是中情局特工  深度卧底
He's a CIA operative, deep cover. 

56
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,760
他管理着一个叫做"21号空间"的地下组织
He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.

57
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
他看中了我的能力
He targeted me for my skills.

58
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,860
迈克尔  他现在正和我们的儿子在一起
Michael, he's with our son right now.

59
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,960
我会尽快赶到美国
I'll get to the States as soon as I can.

60
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,400
我丈夫雅各布·奈斯
Did my husband, Jacob Ness,

61
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,940
有没有让你查我的手机
ask you to work on my cell phone?

62
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,830
他说他想找出
He said he was looking to find

63
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,760
跟踪他妻子的那些人
the people who were stalking his wife, 

64
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,840
我做了深度数据追踪
so I did a data dive.

65
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,330
我儿子呢
Where's my son?

66
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,250
在我手里
I have him.

67
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,990
至于我需不需要用他威胁你
And whether or not I have to threaten him

68
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,460
这全看你要不要放下手里的枪了
is entirely contingent upon you putting the gun down.

69
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,550
发现卡尼尔·乌提斯
Kaniel Outis

70
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,220
在地中海一艘货船上
has been located on a cargo ship in the Mediterranean.

71
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,250
他们识破你了

72
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,350
跑
Run!

73
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,930
{\an8}地中海某处

喂  哥们
Hey, yo,

75
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,370

马赛
Marseille.

77
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,980
-马赛  -马赛
- Marseilles. - ‭Marseilles.

78
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,450
我欠你的  斯科菲尔德
I own you, Scofield.

79
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,410
{\an8}六年前

80
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,720
你的事情我全都知道
I know everything about you.

81
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,120
连你最平常的小动作都知道  比如动物园
Even your most mundane actions, like the zoo.

82
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,130
你和动物园算怎么回事
What's with you and the zoo?

83
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,250
我去那里思考
I go there to think.

84
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,310
上个月去了十八次吗
18 times in the past month?

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,220
-真没少思考  -我在想怎么才能把你的人
- A lot of thinking. - I was figuring out how to get your guy 

86
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,600
从巴兰基亚弄出来
out of Barranquilla. 

87
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,830
结果发现他不仅是个叛军首领
Turns out he's not just a rebel leader--

88
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,430
还是个杀人不眨眼的反社会分子
he's a murderous sociopath.

89
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,230
舍不得孩子  套不得狼嘛
That's the only way to make omelets.

90
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,350
我需要更多地了解我们的目标
I need to know more about our targets.

91
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,270
如果我要策划越狱的话  容不得半点闪失
If I'm facilitating escapes, we can't have surprises.

92
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,620
你应当为之自豪  你我二人
Be proud. You and me,

93
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,890
-我们在改变世界  -并没有让它变得更好
- we're changing the world. - Doesn't make it right.

94
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,450
别搞得好像你突然之间成了安于现状的人
Don't act like you're suddenly a fan of the status quo, okay?

95
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,040
现在这种体制的运作又慢又蠢  注定要完蛋
The system, it's slow, stupid, and doomed to fail.

96
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,770
这就是当初你不得不把你哥救出来的原因
That's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place.

97
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,860
我上次见你之后才有的新纹身啊
New ink since the last time I saw you.

98
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,380
-在做新计划吗  -不  没有什么新计划
- Working on a new plan? - No. No new plan.

99
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,860
就是看不习惯光秃秃的皮肤
Just get tired of looking at empty skin.

100
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,220
你知道  当初就是在福克斯河监狱的
You know, it was those tats at Fox River

101
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,100
那些纹身吸引到了我的目光
that caught my eye in the first place.

102
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,820
我告诉自己  那个将其计划
I had to know everything about the man

103
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,020
纹在身上的人  我得了解他的一切
who wore his plans on his skin.

104
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,110
看似一览无遗  实则神秘莫测
In plain sight yet so mysterious.

105
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,300
实权的关键在于消失
The key to real power is to disappear.

106
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,440
-奈斯教授  你好  -克劳迪娅  你好
- Hi, Professor Ness. - Hello, Claudia.

107
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,020
实权的秘诀
Yeah, the secret to real power

108
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,680
在于决不违背你的意愿
is to never betray your intentions,

109
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,130
深藏不露
to wear nothing on your sleeve.

110
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,920
也决不让任何人
And to never let anyone

111
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,380
看见你的脸
see your face.

119

下次我被关禁闭的时候
Next time I'm sitting in solitary,

120
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,680
我会想着你在这个舒服的空调屋里
I'll think of you in here, running the world

121
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,500
统治世界
in air-conditioned comfort.

122
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,820
我也是出过外勤任务的人
I've spent my time in the field.

123
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,210
你准备好去缅甸了吗
You all set for Myanmar?

124
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,460
只剩几周的时间了
It's only a few weeks off.

125
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,420
这就是我为什么来这的原因
That's why I'm here.

126
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,130
我想拉一个人入伙
I want to bring someone on board.

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,060
-真的吗  -实兑监狱[缅甸西部港市]的活儿需要两个人
- Oh, really? - ‭The prison camp at Sittwe is a two-man job.

128
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,030
我一直在关注这个人  他会很有用
I've been watching this guy. He'll be useful.

129
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,870
关注他吗  你现在居然负责招兵买马了吗
Watching him? You in charge of recruiting now?

130
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,450
相信我  我最不想做的就是把别人牵扯进来
Trust me. The last thing I was to do is suck someone else into this.

131
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,100
他会做我的后盾  加快进展
He'll have my back and he'll speed things up,

132
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,130
提高我们的胜算
increase our odds.

133

{\an8}罪犯详细信息  大卫·马丁

134
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,390
履历并不是很出色
Not exactly a distinguished career.

135
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,090
他被关在监狱  是个臭脾气
He's held up well in prison. He's got a mean streak.

136
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,930
还是个孤儿
And he grew up without a family.

137
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,440
这意味着他可以被操控
It means he can be manipulated.

138
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
如果你在蓄谋什么
If you're planning something,

141
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,570
我能从你的眼神中看穿一切
I can see everything in your eyes.

142
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,500
眼神背后的心机才是关键
It's what's behind the eyes that counts,

143
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,950
教授
Professor.

144
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,140
那你要等我一年后想到逃出实兑的计策呢
So you're gonna wait a year for me to find my way out of Sittwe?

145
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,900
还是你会给我找个搭档
Or are you gonna get me a partner,

146
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,620
以便我们继续改变世界的大业呢
so we get on with the business of changing the world?

147
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,870
就这么定了

她回到纽约了
She's back in New York.

154
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,410
她和麦克还好吗
Are she and Mike okay?

155
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,080
我也正要问呢
That's what I'm trying to find out.

156
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,350
{\an8}-雅各布起疑了吗  
-不确定  但我们不能留在这  太危险了

157
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,830
{\an8}别担心  我会来找你  很快  爱你

158
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,160

{\an8}我会很快来见你

162
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,960
是  你会的
Yes, you will.

163
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,910
-我得立刻回美国  -等等
- I got to get back to the States. - Slow down.

164
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,320
你现在是卡尼尔·乌提斯  记得吗
You're Kaniel Outis, remember?

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,690
各国的禁飞名单上都有你
You're on every no-fly list in the world.

166
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,230
雅各布对莎拉下手了
Jacob's done something to Sara.

167
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,130
可能对麦克也是
Maybe Mike, too.

168
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,770
-你怎么知道的  -那条短信
- How do you know? - ‭That text.

169
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,580
她叫儿子小麦
She referred to our son as Junior.

170
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,640
我们说好不那样叫他的
We agreed we'd never call him that.

171
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,220
他在引诱你  迈克尔
He's baiting you, Michael.

172
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,580
他得逞了
It worked.

173
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,990
{\an8}纽约州  伊萨卡

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,200
嗨  小子
Hey, buddy.

175
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,030
妈妈在哪
Where's mom?

176
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,650
你在学校时
I, uh, dropped her off at work

177
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,820
我送她去上班了
while you were at school.

178
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,520
那艘海盗船画得真好
That is quite a pirate ship.

179
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,320
不过桅杆太靠前
Although it would be a little hard

180
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,510
有些不利于航行
to sail with the mast that far forward.

181
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,970
可能会翻船
Your ship might tip over.

182
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,780
桅杆必须在那  这不只是一艘船
The mast has to be there. It's not just a ship--

183
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,120
其实是一幅藏宝图
it's a treasure map.

184
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,050
什么意思
What do you mean?

185
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,510
是给吉米的  我们相互藏乐高玩具玩
It's for Jimmy. We hide Legos for each other.

186
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,200
我总能找到他的
I always find his.

187
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,870
但他却老是找不到我的
He doesn't always find mine.

188
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,500
等等
Wait a second,

189
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,520
这张图怎么会是地图
how is this drawing a map?

190
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,530
这里是公园
This is the park.

191
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,440
那里是游乐场
That's the playground.

192
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,910
这是人行道
And this is the sidewalk.

193
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,500
太厉害了
Impressive.

194
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,100
你给这幅画加了密
You put a code in the drawing.

195
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,130
那么你把乐高藏在哪了
So, okay, where did you hide the Legos?

196
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,450
这些大炮是公园里的水池
These cannons are pools at the park.

197
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,200
但多了一个  在沙坑里
But there's an extra one, in the sand.

198
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,020
我把乐高埋在了那里
That's where I buried the Legos.

199
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,330
做得好  麦克
Well done, Mike.

200
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,130
做得好
Well done.

201
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,410
我联系了所有人  我用尽了美国的人脉
I've tried everyone. I'm out of resources in the States.

202
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,690
用尽了所有的关系  所有能去确认
All my contacts. People who can go and check on them,

203
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,940
他们没事的人
make sure they're okay.

204
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,720
林肯  我必须回家
Linc, I got to get home.

205
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,070
我不能再在货船上待两周时间
I can't spend another two weeks on a cargo ship.

206
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,880
我的妻儿都在他手上
He's got my wife and kid.

207
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,070
也许有别的方法
There may be another way.

208
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,330
你告诉了我你过去七年的经历
You told me about the last seven years of your life.

209
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,380
还没告诉你我的
Haven't told you about mine.

210
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,060
莎拉被赦免后  她离开了巴拿马
After Sara got exonerated, she left Panama.

211
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,630
我和索菲娅留了下来  开了一家潜水用具店
Me and Sofia stayed behind and opened a dive shop.

212
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,540
后来我们分了手  一切都变糟了
We broke up, and everything went to hell.

213
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,360
当时没有你的阻止  等到我自己发觉时
You weren't there to stop me, so before I knew it,

214
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,570
我重操了旧业  干些奇怪的活儿
I was in the old hood, doing odd jobs.

215
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,120
什么叫奇怪的活儿
Odd jobs meaning what?

216
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,810
把东西从一个地方送到另一个地方
Moving things from point A to point B.

217
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,750
给卢卡·阿布鲁齐做事
For Luca Abruzzi.

218
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,700
约翰·阿布鲁齐的儿子
John Abruzzi's son.

219
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,390
没错
Yeah.

220
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,880
当时我只想快速挣钱来重新开始生活
I just wanted some quick cash to kick-start my life.

221
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,220
他们让我别看箱子的东西
They told me not to look in the boxes.

222
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,500
但我还是看了
But I looked in the boxes.

223
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,220
他们从欧洲走私出来的芬太尼[止痛药可制毒]
The amount of fentanyl they're smuggling out of Europe--

224
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,810
每个箱子里都有成千上万颗药丸
tens of thousands of pills in every box--

225
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,070
这是祸害人命啊
it's just killing people.

226
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,730
于是我把一个箱子扔进了垃圾箱
So I dumped a box in a Dumpster,

227
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,620
价值10万美元
100 grand's worth.

228
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,000
现在你欠了阿布鲁齐的儿子一大笔债
Now you're in hock to Abruzzi's son.

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,840
没错  他想杀了我
Yeah. He wants to kill me.

230
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,610
但这可能是快速回到美国的捷径
But maybe it's a way to get back to the States real fast.

231
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,660
{\an8}纽约

232
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,760
你胆真肥  布鲁斯
You got balls, Burrows.

233
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,300
你真觉得我想帮你吗
You actually think I want to help you?

234
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,890
如果我给你10万美元呢
What if I can get you the $100K?

235
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,790
十万美元
$100k?

236
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,640
你打算怎么筹到这笔钱
How are you gonna come up with that

237
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
在芝加哥的小巷里摸爬滚打吗
crawling around the back alleys of Chicago?

238
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,680
我不在芝加哥  我在马赛
I'm not in Chicago. I'm in Marseilles.

239
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,880
-马赛  -是的
- Marseilles? - Yeah.

240
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,020
我做了几笔生意  我手头有10万美元
I've been working on a couple deals. I got $100K in my hand.

241
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,260
但我想要脱身
But I want off the hook.

242
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,210
当然了  要不你过来亲手把钱给我
Sure you do. How about you get over here and hand it to me?

243
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,540
这就是我打给你的原因
That's why I'm calling.

244
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,360
我要神不知鬼不觉地溜进美国
I need to sneak into the States invisible,

245
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
就像你的毒品一样
like your pills.

246
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,720
你的那些从欧洲出发的飞机
Those flights you got coming out of Europe--

247
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,170
那些运芬太尼[止痛药可制毒]的飞机  给我留几个位子
the fentanyl flights-- I need a few seats.

248
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,450
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

249
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,730
我来联系一下
I'll make a few calls.

250
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,990
因为要么我见到你时  你把钱给我
'Cause either I'm gonna see you and get that money,

251
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,050
要么我见到你时  你的下场会更难看
or I'm gonna see you, and you're gonna get something a whole lot worse.

252
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,700
不敢相信我又要这么虐自己
I can't believe I'm doing this to myself again.

253
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,270
区别在于  这次你不是一个人在战斗
Difference is this time, you're not alone.

254
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,330
天啊  这东西真恶心
God, these things are disgusting.

255
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,590
它叫什么来着
What they call 'em again?

256
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,460
血肠
Boudin noir.

257
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,770
我不确定里面有什么
Not sure what's in them.

258
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,260
我觉得你的法语没有你想象中那么好
I don't think your French is as good as you think it is.

259
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,400
没吃蜗牛你就知足吧
Yo, be happy you're not eating snails.

260
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,970
{\an8}恐怖分子登上货船
卡尼尔·乌提斯或在船上

261
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,270
你觉得他们发现了吗
Do you think they noticed?

262
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,410
别抱侥幸心理
Let's not take any chances.

263
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,740
伙计们
Guys.

264
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,850
你们的照片上新闻了
Your faces were on the news.

265
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,550
如果有人看到你  这事就完蛋了
Somebody sees you, this thing is over.

266
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,310
-我们得走了  兄弟  -我们该走了
- We got to move, papi. - We got to go.

267
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,040
等等  卢卡
Hold. Luca.

268
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,070
如果你午夜之前能到里昂
If you can get to Lyon by midnight,

269
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,640
我就能安排你上飞机
I can get you on a flight.

270
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,180
我在纽约有个仓库  你来找我吗
I got a warehouse in New York. You're coming to me?

271
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,060
我们会去的
We'll be there.

272
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,490
我不确定我到底
Can't decide whether I want you

273
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,420
希望你有没有那笔钱  布鲁斯
to have that money or not, Burrows.

274
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,830
杀了你或许能让我更爽
Killing you might be a lot more satisfying.

275
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,390
现在我们知道他们躲过了地中海的飞弹攻击
Now we know they survived the strike in the Mediterranean.

276
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,010
我们很确信他会回伊萨卡
We can be pretty sure he's coming back to Ithaca.

277
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,230
我需要一些解释
I need some clarification.

278
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,610
他为什么要回这里
Why would he come back here...

279
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,550
回美国
to the States

280
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,190
他在这里的话
when he's more wanted here

281
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,510
被抓的风险更高
than anywhere else in the world?

282
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,550
没错
Of course.

283
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,170
是因为他们
Because of them.

284
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,530
他在为我卖命之前  有自己的生活
He had a life before he worked for me,

285
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,090
有自己的名字  迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
a name-- Michael Scofield.

286
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,360
有自己的家庭
A family.

287
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,760
当他走了之后  结果是我在照料他们
And when he went away, I ended up looking after them.

288
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,250
结果... 我爱上了他们
Ended up... falling for them.

289
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,380
他想杀了我
He wants to kill me.

290
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,030
他认为我偷走了他的生活  毁了他
He thinks I stole his life, ruined him,

291
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,350
这就说到了他的精神分裂了
which speaks to his dissociative mind.

292
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,670
我是说  他是杀人犯  叛徒  恐怖分子
I mean, he's a murderer, a turncoat, a terrorist.

293
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,990
但我们可以利用这一点
But we'll use it.

294
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,450
如果有必要  我来当诱饵
I'll be the bait if I have to.

295
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,200
以便我们能着手彻底干掉他
So we can go about taking him down once and for all.

296
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,800
他不会就这样在这里晃荡的
He's not just gonna stroll in here.

297
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,150
他太聪明了
He's too clever for that.

298
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,350
所以我们请了一位更聪明的
That's why we got someone even more clever.

299
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,580
梭罗吗
Thoreau?

300
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,950
这家伙是个胆小鬼
Guy's a pencil neck.

301
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,340
是个了解斯科菲尔德计划的胆小鬼
A pencil neck with insight into Scofield's plan.

302
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,750
这样你才能当好汉
So you, in turn, can be the hammer.

303
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,510
这张截图来自他从沙漠发出的聊天视频
Screen-grab of the Skype transmission he sent from the desert.

304
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,660
通过服务器将它传给叫"蓝色夏威夷"的人
He routed the image through a server to this BlueHawaii guy,

305
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,780
但也可能通过子路线秘密传送给
but it could have been secretly subrouted to another, 

306
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,620
一名尚不知身份的人来使用其中加密的信息
yet unknown, recipient to use the information encoded in it.

307
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,010
什么信息
Information?

308
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,460
真的很了不起
It's actually incredible.

309
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,570
图片用阿拉伯语加密  包含了很多信息
Encrypted in the Arabic, the images are all sorts of stuff.

310
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,600
乍一看  太平常不过了
Apparently, mundane as hell.

已失效的互联网留言板链接
links to defunct message boards on the Internet.

313
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,940
什么留言板
What message boards?

314

Truesnuff.com  Hunterspycamporn.com
Truesnuff.com, Hunterspycamporn.com,

315
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,310
两个网站上都有... 这个
both of which carry... this.

316
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,600
哈伦·盖恩斯谋杀案的照片
Images of the Harlan Gaines murder.

317
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,520
这混蛋干嘛丢这些照片出来嘲讽我们
What's the bastard doing rubbing that in our faces?

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,860
有那么多信息可以加密  为什么选这个
Of all the things to encrypt, why that?

319
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,250
你从这里面发现了什么
What's that get you?

320
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,330
从隐写术的角度看  有很多发现
Stegaonographically, a lot.

321
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,920
隐写术是一种将信息隐藏在
Steganography is the practice of concealing information

322
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,370
组成数字文件的代码中的技术

323
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,980
俄罗斯用  中国用  大家都会用
Russians do it, Chinese, everybody.

324
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,980
他可能觉得如果有人能看见这些
He's probably thinking if anyone sees this,

325
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,640
他们能看见的也仅此而已
this'll be as far as they'll look.

326
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,500
但我已经深入到图像内部
But I'm already going inside the image, 

327
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
破解了构成图像的数据
breaking down the data that comprises it. 

328
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,980
我脑袋都晕了
This is making my head spin.

329
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,530
重点是如果我们使用大数据  人工智能
Point is we put big data, AI on this,

330
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,310
很快就能破解里面隐藏的任何代码
we can crunch any codes hidden in there pretty quickly.

331
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,500
这就是我正在做的
And that's what I'm doing.

332
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,400
好样的
Nice work,

333
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,960
但事实是如果我已做好自己的本分
but the truth is if I've done my job,

334
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,870
或许他就会先暴露自己的意图
he may reveal his intentions to us first.

335
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,860
因为现在我已迫使他偏离计划这么远
Because I've got him so far off his game now,

336
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,170
他会过早开始行动
he'll start to play his cards too early...

337
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,420
泰迪[即茶包哥]
Teddy.

338
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,720
{\an8}现在知道神秘捐助人就是我了吧
不过天上不会掉馅饼
总有一天  你得为我出力  为他人所不能为
信封内的信息将改变你的人生
看了你就明白了
但作为回报  你必须"杀"一个人[双关语  选择新的人生]

339
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,380
"但作为回报  你必须'杀'一个人"[双关语  选择新的人生]
"But in return, you must take a life."

340
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,410
甚至在电脑计算出结果之前
...show us what the tattoos mean

341
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,410
就能告诉我们纹身的含义
even before the computers will, 

342
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,350
以及所有他准备招募来参加行动的人
and all the people he'll be enlisting for the fight.

343
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,440
你得打给这个法国的付费电话
You have to call this pay phone in France.

344
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,810
等等  芝加哥吗  我还以为要和你一起走
Wait. Chicago? I thought I was going with you.

345
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,100
等你明白为什么你是我的得力干将再说
Not until you find out why you're my whip-hand.

346
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,290
我必须要到芝加哥才能明白吗
I have to go to Chicago to find that out?

347
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,500
一路平安
Safe travels.

348
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,750
在他如此繁复的计划之中
In the grandiosity of his plan,

349
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,850
他会看不清最简单的细节
he'll lose sight of the simplest details.

350
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,330
他昨晚给我发信息所用的手机
The phone he texted me with 

351
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,290
位置定位在法国里昂
was located in Lyon, France last night.

352
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,100
晚上11点51分时在机场航站楼关机
It was turned off in an airport terminal at 11:51 P.M...

353
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,880
再过20分钟就有架直飞纽约的航班
...20 minutes before a direct flight to New York 

354
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,090
你们就去那守株待兔
where you'll be waiting for him

355
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,210
彻底结束这场游戏
to put this game to bed for good.

356
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,320
{\an8}纽约州  肯尼迪国际机场

357
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,360
前往佛罗里达州迈阿密市的
Flight 290 to Miami, Florida will now

358
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,880
290次航班现在将离开B24号登机口
depart from gate B24.

359
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,880
他刚刚重新开机了
He just powered back up.

360
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,870
{\an8}肯尼迪国际机场

361
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,960
我们找到他了
We got him.

362
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,960
小心
Look out!

363
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,700
机尾
Back of the plane.

364
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,130
抱歉  抱歉  你们不可以...
Uh, excuse me! Excuse me. You're not allowed...

365
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,720
看来游戏还在继续
Looks like the game's still going.

366
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,390
{\an8}纽约州北部  威尔莫特市立机场

367
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,850
你只靠贿赂机场的小官员
It's impressive how you get these drugs in the country 

368
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,490
就能把这些毒品运进国内也是没谁了
just by bribing small-time airport officials.

369
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,250
我猜你在这放了
I'm guessing you got about

370
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,810
价值五百万的芬太尼
five million bucks worth of fentanyl in here.

371
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,040
那又怎样
So what?

372
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,900
你和你弟是要来教我做人吗
You and your brother here are gonna lecture me?

373
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,250
我们其实是在讨论
We were actually debating on whether

374
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,110
要不要给你那十万
I should give you the 100K or not.

375
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,690
他说这钱沾着无辜者的血
He says it's blood money.

376
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,300
我同意
I agree.

377
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,140
闭上嘴直接把钱给我怎样  布鲁斯
How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?

378
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,640
我没钱
I don't have it.

379
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,860
抓住他的人  把他们带到后面枪毙
Grab his guys, bring 'em to the back and shoot 'em.

380
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,500
你不想往你的拘捕令上再添谋杀罪吧
I don't think you want to add murder to your arrest warrant.

381
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,350
等一下
Wait.

382
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,020
什么拘捕令
Arrest warrant?

383
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,430
外面的那个家伙
That guy out there

384
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,400
是缉毒局的人
is a DEA informant.

385
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,880
他现在完全听我们的
We have him in our pocket.

386
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,230
他欠我们的  他有三车的
He owes us. He's got three vans

387
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,510
探员在等着他的电话
full of agents that are waiting for his call.

388
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,480
他们会如雨点般扑向你和你藏的毒品
They're gonna rain down on you and your pills.

389
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,040
除非你不再追究我哥的欠款
Unless you forgive my brother's debt.

390
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,510
那么我们的线人就不会打电话
Then our informant won't make the call.

391
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,600
让你弟来给你撑腰吗
Have your brother fighting your battles, do you?

392
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,000
不是
No.

393
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,650
不如让你的人放下枪
Why don't you tell your guys to drop the guns,

394
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,740
然后我们单挑
and you and I can have it out?

395
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,760
你怎么说  卢卡
What do you say, Luca?

396
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,740
把外面那人赶跑
Scare that guy off.

397
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,150
把这些人带到后面去
Bring these guys to the back.

398
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,940
他们一旦有动作  他就会打电话
They make a move, he makes a call.

399
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,070
真的吗  我觉得你在唬我
Yeah? I think you're bluffing.

400
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,980
我可警告过你了
I warned you.

401
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,400
有人入侵
We got company.

402
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,240
你开枪杀我们  现在就有几十个目击者了
You shoot us, there's dozens of witnesses now.

403
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,550
我们走
Let's go.

404
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,590
只要让他们看到缉毒局的帽子和几辆SUV
All they had to see were DEA hats and SUVs,

405
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,920
他们就被吓跑了
and they were gone.

406
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,430
久仰大名啊  迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Famous Michael Scofield.

407
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,460
希巴  谢谢你做的一切
Sheba. Thank you for everything.

408
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,660
你都不知道我见到你回家有多高兴
You have no idea how happy I am to see you back home.

409
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,900
我们还没到家
We're not home yet.

410
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,280
好吧  下一步怎么办
All right, so what's next?

411
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,330
我们怎么抓到这个混蛋
How do we get this son of a bitch?

412
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,760
不是"我们"做什么
We don't do anything.

413
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,190
你的使命已经完成了
Your part is over.

414
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,050
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no, no.

415
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,850
戏耍一回阿布鲁齐的儿子是一回事
Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing.

416
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,150
但波塞冬  他见过你的脸
Poseidon-- he knows your face.

417
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,260
自从你到了也门就一直在追踪你
Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.

418
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,670
你一直是名勇士  我欠你一个人情
You've been a warrior, and I owe you.

419
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,530
但现在你的脸会拖累你和你的家人
But your face is a liability now to you and your family.

420
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,520
我不想让你涉险
I don't want you to risk that.

421
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,840
他们或许认得他的脸  但认不出我的
They may know his face, but they don't know mine.

422
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,350
出其不意  攻其不备嘛
It's the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out.

423
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,060
这才是我的希巴
That's my Sheba.

424
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,380
你照顾好她  行吗
You take care of her, all right?

425
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,340
你是说让我照顾好他吧
I take care of him, you mean.

426
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,570
好兄弟
I love you, brother.

427
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,850
好兄弟
Love you, too.

428
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,970
-注意安全  好吗  -你也是
- Be safe, okay? - ‭You, too.

429
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,870
-再见  -好的  那么...
- Bye. - ‭All right. Well...

430
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,880
再有事需要我
when you need me again,

431
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,830
你知道去哪里找我
you know where to find me.

432
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,500
我们会在下午四点转移她
We'll transport her at 1600 hours.

433
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,410
在那之前保持低调  谢谢
Lay low until then. Thank you.

434
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,640
刚才那一幕你不介意吗
That doesn't bother you-- what you just saw in there?

435
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,570
把老婆关在地下室
Down in the basement with his wife, 

436
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,100
那个他口口声声说深爱的女人
the woman he says he fell for?

437
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,350
别说了
Stop.

438
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,010
干完这次我就退出"21号空间"
I'm done with 21-Void after this.

439
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,950
等我们抓到斯科菲尔德  乌提斯
After we get Scofield... Outis--

440
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,720
管他叫什么
whatever his name is--

441
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,350
我退出
I'm done.

442
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,510
我就只是想抓到杀害盖恩斯的凶手
That's all I ever wanted, to get Gaines' killer, 

443
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,870
但他在里面做的事
but what he's got going on in there--

444
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,030
那可不正常
that's not normal.

445
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,480
那是私仇  太变态了
It's personal. Something sicker.

446
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,020
没人能离开"21号空间"  梵  你很知道
There's no leaving 21-Void, Van. You know that.

447
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,630
他雇我们  因为我们是顶尖高手
He hired us because we are the best.

448
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,800
我们想做什么都可以
We can do whatever we want.

449
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,420
如果干完这次后我们想要人间蒸发
And if we want to disappear after this...

450
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,610
我们就可以销声匿迹
we can disappear.

451
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,830
不可能逃走的
There's no getting out.

452
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,420
如果你那么想...
If you think that way...

453
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,200
那你也沦为了一名"囚徒"
then you're a prisoner, too.

454
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,270
门口那人说他们到这里五分钟之后
The guy at the gate said the vehicles split

455
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,010
那些车就分开走了
five minutes after they got here.

456
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,620
五分钟吗
Five minutes?

457
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,900
哪里不太对
Something ain't right.

458
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,310
货还在这里没动
The product is still here.

459
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,090
走
Come on.

460
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,050
这些全都是他们预谋好的
It was all staged.

461
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,310
高明啊
Clever.

462
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,220
但布鲁斯会为此丢了小命的
But Burrows is gonna die for it.

463
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,420
我不知道我们该怎么找到他
I don't know how we're gonna find him.

464
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,720
他已跑得不见踪影了
He's in the wind.

465
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,230
那可不一定
Maybe not.

466
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,130
易通路卡的接收器
EZ Pass transponders.

467
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,420
桑特拉在高速运输管理局有认识的人
Santora's got a guy at transit authority.

468
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,100
他肯定能告诉我们他们何时上了哪条路
I bet you he can tell us what roads they've been taking and when.

469
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,490
接下来就要靠我们巡查周边
Then it's up to us to comb the neighborhoods,

470
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,780
找到那些车
find the vehicles,

471
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,310
然后一枪打死那个贱人
and put a bullet in that son of a bitch once and for all.

472
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,420
我有个奇怪的要求
I got a weird request.

473
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,900
如果我给你一些坐标  你能带我去吗
If I give you some coordinates, can you take me to 'em?

474
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,010
我试试
See what I can do.

475
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,710
不行  除非这辆车自带浮船  否则没门
No. Unless this cab's got pontoons, ain't gonna happen.

476
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,690
这坐标在密歇根湖中央
These coordinates are in the middle of Lake Michigan.

477
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,590
{\an8}纽约州  伊萨卡

478
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,780
就是这里了
This is it.

479
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,430
没有灯光
No lights.

480
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,960
我觉得他们不在这里  迈克尔
I don't think they're here, Michael.

481
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,820
除非他就是想让我们这么想
Unless that's what he wants us to think.

482
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
走吧
Come on.

483
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,460
准备好尽快带我们逃跑
Get ready to get us out of here as fast as you can.

484
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,760
林肯
Linc.

485
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,290
多加小心
Be careful.

486
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:38,810
谢了
Thanks.

487
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,690
怎么了
What's wrong?

488
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,410
怪不得莎拉从来都不回信
That's why Sara never responded.

489
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,540
我不能跟任何人联系
I wasn't allowed to contact anyone,

490
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,050
但她是我妻子
but she was my wife.

491
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,190
{\an8}莎拉·斯科菲尔德收
纽约州  伊萨卡  内斯特路1990号  
邮编  14850

492
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,380
我使用本以为只有她会知道的方法联系她
I reached out to her in a way I thought only she would know.

493
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,790
但他也知道
But he knew my ways, too.

494
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,210
什么也没有
Nothing.

495
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,320
{\an8}莎拉
我在伊萨卡

496
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,900
你在干什么
What are you doing?

497
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,140
{\an8}谢天谢地

498
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
那不是莎拉  迈克尔
That's not Sara, Michael.

499
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,030
他不知道我察觉了
He doesn't know I know that.

500
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,820
{\an8}你和麦克明天能出发吗

501
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,720
{\an8}能  要我们去哪

502
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,460

503
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,680
{\an8}菲力牛排

504
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,350
这回答是对的  她还活着
That's the right answer. She's alive.

505
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,260
他肯定跟她在一起
He must be right there with her.

506
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,340
我要安排一次见面
I'm gonna set a meeting.

507
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,410
什么  你就这么亲自过去露个脸吗
And what, you're just gonna show up and show your face?

508
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,090
没错
Yes.

509
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,710
{\an8}雪城的莫雷利牛排餐馆  正午碰面

510
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,780
那表示波塞冬也会露面
That means Poseidon has to show his face, too.

511
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,780
游戏的最终局开启
And the endgame begins.

我没看见他
I'm not seeing him.

516
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,870
那就对了  他是在等我们
And you shouldn't. He's waiting for us

517
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,860
走第一步棋
to push the first piece out onto the board.

518
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,210

Which would be me?

00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,500

接车服务  我来接一位女士和小孩

快走
Hit the road.

526
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,840
记下那辆黑色SUV

527

不用  那只是让你露个面用的
No need. They were just here to make you show your face.

528
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,370
现在走开  快

529
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,570
好  表现出有点小慌张的样子

00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,880
你能听见我吗
Can you hear me?

544

毁了我的国家的狗杂种长这个样子

他带走了莎拉  但我们没看见她

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,250
什么叫你没看见她
What do you mean you couldn't see her?

562
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,540
我们的视角看不到
There's no way we could have.

563
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,140
我的天  莎拉
Oh, my God. Sara.

564
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,400
当时后座上没人吗
There was no one in the backseat? 

565
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,820
不  车窗涂了银膜  我们看不到
No, the windows were blacked out-- we couldn't see.

566
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:09,920
这是什么
What's that?

567
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,940
我儿子画的
My son did this.

这上面可能会有些什么
There might be something here.

570

一艘海盗船  上面有三个海盗
A pirate ship with three pirates--

就是我  莎拉  还有麦克
That's me, Sara and... Mike.

574
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,180

575
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,690
这是... 是条多头蛇
It's a... it's a many-headed hydra

576
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,920
正往上爬伺机攻击
reaching up to attack.

577
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,880
是在说雅各布吗
Think it's Jacob?

578
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,980
八九不离十
Must be.

579
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,710
这是一条讯息
This is a message. 

580
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,050
你是说麦克在画里暗藏了讯息
You're telling me Mikey's left something encoded in that?

581
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,290
是啊  他天生就懂
Yeah. Yeah, it's encoded in him.

582
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,710
他遗传了我的基因
He's got my DNA.

583
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,330
可他连你要来都不知道
He didn't even know you were coming.

584
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,480
肯定是莎拉告诉他的  我不知道
Sara must have told him. I don't know.

585
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,320
她肯定跟他说了我要来
She must have told him I was coming.

586
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:49,560
这里面绝对有什么  百分百有
There's definitely something here. Definitely.

587
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,700
那是什么
What is it?

588
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,220
卢卡的一个手下
It's one of Luca's guys.

589
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,250
什么
What?

590
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,790
他是怎么追踪我们到这的
How the hell did he track us here?

591
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,800
我不知道
I don't know.

592
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,080
我只知道所有的因果报应
All I know is all the chickens are coming home

593
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,810
都挑了这个最糟糕的时候找上门来
to roost at the worst possible time.

594
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,770
我们得赶紧走
We got to go.

595
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,870
哥
Linc?

596
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,260
我懂了
I got it.

597
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,760
这艘船  这艘大帆船
This ship, this galleon.

598
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,400
船所在的这片水域  我刚看了地图
The body of water it's on. I looked at the map.

599
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,510
有片湖的轮廓和这个一模一样
There's a lake, a lake shaped exactly like it,

600
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,150
就在手指湖区
up in the Finger Lakes district.

601
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,260
"长湖"
"Long lake."

602
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,350
这个X标记应该是指长湖的东岸
This X would be on the east shore of that lake.

603
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,580
他是在告诉我们他的位置
He's telling us where he is.

604
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,570
我在想你是不是疯了
I'm trying to figure out if you lost your mind or not.

605
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,270
只有一个办法能搞清楚了
There's only one way to find out.

606
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,440
什么
‭What?

607
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,370
-你得回布法罗去  -什么
- You're going back to Buffalo. - ‭What?!

608
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,770
我要你和你的家人待在一起  照看难民
I want you to be with your family, look after the refugees.

609
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:53,140
林肯  我也是这件事的一员
Linc, I'm a part of this fight, too...

610
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,930
这是什么意思
What was that?

611
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,810
吻别
It's good-bye.

612
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,610
如果你出事  我永远都不会原谅自己

674

1991年  有个漂亮的女服务员

675

想找一个独自生存能力强的人

682
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,540
因为你与生俱来的生存本能

连最糟糕的监狱里也能混得风生水起

是你与生俱来的  孩子

709

我... 我没画过地图
