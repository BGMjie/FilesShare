00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,820
但正如这个信封是寄给我的
But just like that envelope's addressed to me,

168
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,240
这段话也是给我的  一定是的
those words are addressed to me. Got to be!

169
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,880
滚
‭Get out.

170
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,260
我是在帮你理清思路
I'm trying to work with you here.

171
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,800
有没有任何可能你弟弟活下来了
Is there any possible way your brother could've survived?

172
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,020
我弟弟已经死了
My brother's dead.

173
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,310
那又是谁寄的这个  为什么呢
Th-Then who sent this? And why?

174
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,300
快滚
Get out.

175
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,450
至少让我带走我合法的信件 
Least let me take my rightful correspondence.

176
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,470
我做了备份  布鲁斯
Oh, I made a copy, Burrows.

177
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,120
虽然我早知道你还会是一如既往的顽固不化
I knew you'd be the same obstinate son of a beyotch you always been,

178
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,350
但我还是指望过你能开窍
but I'd hoped you'd seen the light.

179
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,550
然而你依然是狗改不了吃屎
But you are what you is and you is what you are.

180
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,080
但我还是要告诉你
Still, I'm telling you...

181
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,110
命运不知为何又让我们密不可分
fate has got us joined at the hip somehow.

185

我以为再也不会见到你
I didn't think I was ever gonna see you again.

189
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,030
你没来参加婚礼
You didn't come to the wedding.

190
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,940
我心想...  我懂
I mean, I figured I...I get it--

191
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,560
你恨我嫁给了你弟弟以外的人  但...
he hates me for marrying someone other than his brother, but...

我一直过得不太好  莎拉

我的脑子一直以来都一片混乱
My brain, it's... it's been a mess.

194
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,510
所以我才没来
That's why I didn't show up.

195
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,000
我也不想让我的侄子看到我那副鬼样
And... I didn't want my nephew to see me like that.

196
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,220
不过现在想置身事外都不可能了
But now it's impossible to stay away.

197
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,660
居然有人开这种国际玩笑
Someone's got a sick sense of humor.

198
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,190
我明白你希望这是真的

失去兄弟
Losing a brother--

仿佛生活中出现一个巨大的空洞
the massive hole that leaves in your life.

201
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,220
失去丈夫也一样
Like the same massive hole losing a husband is.

你对于他而言
You've become kind of like

然后就能和叔叔好好叙旧了
And then you can catch up with your uncle.

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,270
他不仅把你当神话  迈克尔在他心里也一样
He hasn't just mythologized you. He mythologizes Michael, too.

223
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,890
仿佛觉得他生来便是神一样的存在
It's like someone thinking he was born to a god,

224
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,280
一个他从未见过的神...
a god he's never met...

一个不仅是现在
and who isn't here.

以后也永远不会出现的神
And who never will be again.

那你要怎么解释这个
how do you explain that?

这不是原始照片  林肯
It's Photoshop, Linc,

234
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
它被处理过了
or something.

235
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,540
你得想想这是谁给你的
You got to consider the source.

这毕竟来自茶包哥啊
This came from T-Bag.

我知道你的所作所为
I know what you've done.

278
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,480
所以我不想被人看到我跟你这种人在一起
That's why I don't want to be seen associating with your sort.

279
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,500
我只想知道我为什么来这里  以及
Just want to know why I'm here, and...

280
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,820
这事跟我在监狱里收到的特殊信封
if this has anything to do with that special envelope

281
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,320
有没有任何关系
I received in the prison.

282
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,450
我对信封的事情一无所知
I know nothing about an envelope.

283
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,430
我只能告诉你我的工作

通过大脑操控义肢
Using the brain to manipulate prosthesis

286
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,870
就像你天生的肢体一样
as it were a natural limb.

287
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,850
但是同其他前沿科技一样
But as with any cutting-edge work,

288
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,460
资金并不容易筹备  然而
funding is not easy to find, and yet,

289
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,380
意外的是  我收到了捐赠
incredibly, I got the grant

290
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,960
而且是一笔数量可观的匿名捐款
in the form of a considerable anonymous grant

291
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,260
只有一个条件
on one condition--

292
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,460
我手术的第一个义肢接受者
the first recipient of my procedure...

293
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,490
必须是你
is you.

294
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,960
我可以给你配备
I can equip you

295
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,570
一个行动自如的义肢
with a fully articulate prosthetic,

296
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,400
在使用上与真手毫无差异
operationally indistinguishable from a real hand.

297
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,890
这一切都是因为一位匿名捐助者吗
All of this because of an anonymous donor?

298
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,000
看来这都是有人为我们安排好的
Someone seems to have plans for both of us.

299
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,230
如果你感兴趣的话
I've reserved an operational lab for Monday

300
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,940
我已经预订了周一的手术室
if you decide you are interested.

301
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,370
毕竟这是你的手
It's your hand, ultimately.

302
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,290
经汝之手
By your hand,

303
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,540
晓后世之荣耀
you shall know glories of your progeny.

304
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,990
你说什么
What's that?

305
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,410
没什么  医生
Nothing, Doc.

306
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,700
拜托了  迈克尔
Come on, Michael.

307
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,340
你肯定给我留下了什么线索
You must have left me something.

308
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,210
快啊
Come on!

309
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,660
快
Come on.

310
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,990
什么情况
What's going on?

311
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,900
天啊  发生了什么
Oh, my God, what happened?

312
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,580
我不清楚  我去报警
I'm not sure. I'm gonna call the police.

313
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,160
喂
Hello?

314
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,780
我把迈克尔的坟墓挖开了  他不在里面
I dug up Michael's grave. He's not in it.

315
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,740
他...什么
He... What?

316
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,740
莎拉  刚才有人想杀我
Sara, someone just tried to kill me.

317
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,870
他们一直在盯着我  一直在
They've been watching. They've been watching,

318
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,560
-可能就是为了...  -谁想要杀你

319
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,650
从机场就有人在跟踪我  我...

然后他们... 他们换了一辆...

323
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,130
什么来着  换了一辆小货车
What was it? A pickup.

324
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,020
那辆小货车什么颜色
What color was the pickup?

325
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,490
黑色的
Black.

326
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,520
怎么了
Why?

327
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,140
莎拉
Sara?

328
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,150
雅各布

329
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,520

有个洞  里面有把枪

331
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,500
-你把它拿出来  -什么

快  快  有人找上我们了
Right now! Right now! Someone's coming for us!

333
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,560
一把枪  一把枪是什么意思
A gun? What do you mean, a gun?

334
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,150
麦克
Mike?

335
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,490
911  您遇到什么紧急情况
9-1-1. What is your emergency?

336
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,710
我家有人持械入室
I have an armed intruder in the house.

我需要你们马上派人来

我没有时间了  求你们快点来

339
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,310
-麦克  -莎拉

340
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,940
发生什么事了  萨拉
What's going on, Sara?

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,130
就我一个人  家里没有别人
It's just me. There's no one else in the house.

344
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,460
-你想干什么  -快进浴缸
- What do you want? - Get in the tub.

345
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,760
外面是谁  妈妈  他们想干什么
Who's here, Mom? What do they want?

346
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,640
我也不知道  宝贝
I don't know, baby.

347
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,490
好的  听我说  无论谁进了门
Okay, listen to me, if anyone comes through that door,

348
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,060
千万不要动  好吗
you don't move, okay?

349
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,580
我会用这个捅他们  你不会受到伤害的
I will put this through them, and you will not be harmed.

350
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,880
听懂了吗  好孩子
You understand? Good boy.

351
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,350
雅各布
Jacob?

352
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,850
妈妈
Mom.

353
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:56,920
把你能找到的毛巾都拿来
Go get every towel you can find.

354
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,410
快去  快去
Right now, right now.

355
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,750
坚持住  雅各布
Please, Jacob.

356
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,060
好吧  我觉得伤到动脉了  坚持住
Okay. I think it got an artery. Stay with me.

357
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,120
我要你看着我  好吗
I want you to look at me, all right?

358
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,890
别闭眼睛  别睡
Don't close your eyes and don't go to sleep,

359
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,910
好吗  我要你保持清醒
all right? I'm gonna need you to stay with me.

360
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,190
快叫救护车
I need an ambulance!

361
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,470
他怎么样了
How is he?

362
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,440
子弹几乎完全切断了他的股动脉
The shot almost completely severed his femoral artery

363
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,230
他们正在努力让他的情况稳定下来
so they're trying to stabilize him.

364
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,860
他呢
And him?

365
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,090
他才七岁
He's seven.

366
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,580
你还好吗  小麦
How you doing, Mikey?

367
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,890
出事了  对吗
Something's happening, isn't it?

368
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,200
先是你来了
First, you come

369
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,250
然后那个人进了我们家
and that person came in our house.

370
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,110
是关于我亲生父亲的事  对吗
It has something to do with my real father, doesn't it?

371
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,990
为什么那样说
Why do you say that?

372
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,770
因为我能从她的脸上看出来
Because I can see it in her face.

373
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,320
我要和你叔叔说几句
I'm gonna need to talk to your uncle.

374
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,070
我就在那边
I'm gonna be right over there

375
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,650
你能看到的地方  行吗
where you can see me. Okay?

376
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,030
发生什么事了
What's going on?

377
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,520
我们触发了一些事
We've awoken something.

378
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,780
一些被极力掩盖的关于迈克尔的事
Something people are trying to hide about Michael.

379
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,160
你弟弟死了  林肯
Your brother's dead, Lincoln.

380
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,240
要是他死了  那尸体呢
Or is he dead? Where is the body?

381
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,890
那为什么他要离开
Then why did he leave?

382
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,580
如果这些年他还活着
If he's been out there for all of these years,

383
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,830
他为什么要抛弃他自己的儿子
why did he abandon his own son?

384
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,260
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

385
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,230
如果没事  情况本不会像现在这样
It wouldn't be like this if something wasn't happening.

386
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,090
-是不会  但...  -我们要反击
- It wouldn't, but... - Let's fight back.

387
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,610
我都不知道我们在反击谁
I don't know who we're fighting.

388
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,800
我们去也门查清楚
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

389
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,250
去也门  我还有个儿子  林肯
To Yemen? I have a son, Lincoln.

390
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,270
我丈夫还在急诊室呢
My husband's in the ER. Right?

391
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,950
听着  此刻离开他们
Look, leaving them is exactly the wrong thing

392
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,370
是我最不应该做的事
for me to do right now.

393
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,490
夫人  他可以见你了
Ma'am. He's ready to see you.

394
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,630
马上来
One second.

395
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,260
我会去
I'll do it.

396
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,540
我会去也门
I'll go to Yemen.

397
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,030
你对也门一无所知
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.

398
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,940
我会找到有门路的人
I'll find someone who does.

399
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,930
回见了  小麦
See ya, Mikey.

400
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,700
{\an8}{\pos(193.21,136.621)}纽约州  布法罗

401
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,860
我羡慕你
I envy you.

402
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,100
你扭转了自己的命运
You changed your life around.

403
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,790
一个厌倦了放荡不羁生活的人
A man gets tired of living a profligate life.

404
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,230
所以我参加了圣战
So I took up jihad.

405
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,730
真正的圣战  不是你新闻上看到的那种狂热
Real jihad, not that madness that you see on the news.

406
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,880
内心的战争
War within.

407
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,110
为洗心革面而做的精神斗争
The spiritual struggle to clean up your act.

408
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,370
追寻并侍奉安拉
Finding and serving God.

409
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,980
那挺好的  伙计
That's good, man.

410
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,940
世界需要它  老林
The world needs it, Linc.

411
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,350
我是说  我们在这里是渺小的存在
I mean we're, uh, we're small here

412
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,660
但我们能竭尽所能
but we do what we can

413
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,370
帮助中东地区的维和工作
to help the peace efforts in the Middle East.

414
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,790
在本国组织反激进运动
Working on anti-radicalization campaigns here at home.

415
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,290
正如我说的  精神斗争
Like I said, the struggle.

416
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,000
那也就是我来的原因
That's why I'm here.

417
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,210
如果我要去也门
If I needed to get to Yemen,

418
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,210
你能帮上忙吗
that something you could help me with?

419
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,900
我还以为他死了
I thought he was dead.

420
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,260
大家也是
So did everyone.

421
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,630
但他在奥杰吉亚吗
But Ogygia?

422
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,940
我是说  那里关的都是大人物和政治犯
I mean, that's for heavy hitters, political prisoners.

423
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,360
在也门  这是最糟糕的事了
In Yemen, it doesn't come any worse.

424
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,130
我是说  你知道伪造死亡有多复杂吗
I mean, do you know what it would take to stage a death?

425
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,610
更不用说让一个活人
Not to mention keeping a man who is not dead

426
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,930
在没人察觉的情况下生活七年
under the radar for seven years.

427
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,650
这些人来头不小啊
Some very powerful players.

428
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,740
赛义德  你了解这个清真寺吗
Sayed, what do you make of this mosque right here?

429
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,000
阿克萨清真寺  萨那城里比较大的一个
Aksa Mosque. It's one of the main ones in Sana'a.

430
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,340
它是独一无二的
It's very distinct.

431
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,370
照片中从监狱看向寺院的视角
Sightlines seem pretty consistent

432
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,370
和实际情况相当吻合
with what it would probably be from the prison to the mosque.

433
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,400
我个人认为  照片是真的
Now, you ask me, that photo's legit.

434
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,700
{\an5}奥杰吉亚监狱

435
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,700
{\an8}阿克萨清真寺

436
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,090
那么  我弟弟就在那里
Then that's the building my brother's in.

437
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,200
最简单的做法就是给监狱打电话问问
Easiest way to find out is to call the prison and ask.

438
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,950
我找迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Mafi Michael Scofield.

439
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,700
谢谢
Shukran.

440
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,550
没有叫迈克尔·斯科菲尔德的
There's no Michael Scofield.

441
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,730
在网上搜一张图片
Punch up an image from the Internet.

442
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,340
迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield.

443
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,460
给监狱发过去
Send it to the prison.

444
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,160
可能他用了别的名字
Maybe he's under a different name.

445
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,180
听着  老林  我得说句话
Listen, Linc, I got to say something, man.

446
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,570
镇定点  别着急
Man, you got to slow your roll.

447
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,640
也门正在打内战
Yemen is in a civil war.

448
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,030
整个国家就快崩塌了
They're really close to collapse.

449
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,120
一个持有美国护照的白人
It's no place for a white man with an American passport,

450
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,860
若不会阿拉伯语  绝不会贸然出现在也门
no command of Arabic, to just show up on a whim.

451
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,220
但是很显然  我弟弟做到了
And yet, apparently, my brother did.

452
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,330
找到一张照片
Got a picture.

453
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,660
是你弟弟在福克斯河监狱的入监照
Your brother's intake photo from the Fox River Penitentiary.

454
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,260
这张是车管所的照片
Here's his DMV photo

455
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,110
还有张他以前工作单位网站的照片
and here's a photo from his old workplace Web site.

456
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,320
那不是他
It's not him.

457
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,420
都不是
None of them are.

458
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,220
有人要把他从历史上抹去
Someone's erasing him from history.

459
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,750
林肯  你要去哪
Lincoln, where are you going?

460
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,530
回酒店收拾  然后去机场
Hotel, to grab my stuff, then the airport.

461
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,680
听我说  你不要去也门
Hey, listen. You're not going to Yemen.

462
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,230
-那就拦着我啊  -你撑不了三天
- Stop me. - ‭You won't make it three days.

463
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,320
我们得走正规渠道
We need to go through the proper channels.

464
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,900
正规渠道
The proper channels?

465
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,880
有人要让他彻底消失
Someone's erasing his existence.

466
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,980
谁干的  谁有这个能力
Who does that? Who has that ability?

467
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,530
我跟你说  迈克尔可能
I'm telling you, Michael's caught

468
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,280
被卷入到什么严重的事情里了
in the middle of something big.

469
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,010
如果不是呢
What if he's not caught in the middle?

470
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,550
你什么意思
What are you saying?

471
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,700
迈克尔从未向任何人低过头
Michael has never been anyone's sucker.

472
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,850
他总是可以控制大局  从来都是
He's always been in control. Always.

473
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,620
你是说  他伪造了自己的死
You saying he faked his own death?

474
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,330
我是说  在你进入是非之地前
I'm saying you need to look at all of the possibilities

475
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,590
要考虑到所有可能性
before you walk into a war zone.

476
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,330
我不确定你会来
I wasn't sure you'd come.

477
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,870
有时候人得向命运屈服
Sometimes a man has to surrender to fate.

478
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,980
看看命运为他准备了什么
See what it has in store for him.

479
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,280
我们得给你麻醉
We'll need to put you under.

480
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,080
不  不  不  我不做全身麻醉  伙计
No, no, no. I don't do general anesthetic, compadre.

481
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,280
这样的手术必须做全麻
It's mandatory for a procedure like this.

482
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,760
请原谅我
You'll forgive me

483
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,790
我不喜欢没有知觉的时候
if I have a problem lying unconscious

484
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,930
有人用利器对着我
before a man with sharp items at his disposal.

485
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,690
不全麻这手术没法做
It cannot be done without a general anesthetic.

486
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,340
我以前做过  朋友
I've done it before, friend.

487
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,620
上次的手术可不成功啊
And look what it got you.

488
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,760
你要是在我昏迷时让我出什么意外  我就会...
You do anything untoward to me while I'm under and I'll...

489
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,770
我最不想招惹的人就是你了
You are the last man I'd run afoul of.

490
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,270
明白吗
Okay?

491
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,260
命运啊  你这个神秘的小贱人
Oh fate, you mysterious bitch.

492
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,310
为什么要这样对我
Why you doing this to me?

493
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,700
干洗好了  外套不错
Dry cleaning. Nice jacket.

494
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:49,950
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

495
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,000
祝你愉快
Have a good day.

496
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,850
你这是干什么
What the hell was that for?

497
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,960
苏克雷  你怎么来了
Sucre, what the hell are you doing here?

498
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,280
钞票哥都告诉我了
C-Note told me what's going on.

499
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,260
他叫你来说服我吗
He tell you to talk me out of it?

500
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,610
不  我要跟你一起去
No. I'm coming with you.

501
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,680
你不能去
You're not coming.

502
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,040
迈克尔是我最好的朋友
Michael's my best friend.

503
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,160
如果他还活着  如果他有麻烦  我想帮忙
If he's alive, if he's in trouble, I want to help.

504
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,370
你就没有个工作吗
Don't you have a job or something?

505
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,360
有啊  跑码头  虽然活不是很好
Yeah, on a tramp. Not great work,

506
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:42,150
{\an8}Tramp  也有妓女或流浪汉之意

507
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,320
但是  我可是有前科的  对吧
but hey, I'm an ex-con, right?

508
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,180
跑码头吗
Tramp?

509
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,920
是啊  我"干"了有一阵子了
Yeah, I've been riding her for a while.

510
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,150
你是干什么的  皮条客吗
What are you, a pimp?

511
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,870
什么  不  不是
What? No. No, no, no.

512
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,780
跑码头是自由货船的意思
A tramp is a freelance cargo ship.

513
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,300
我们跑香港  西班牙  布宜诺斯艾利斯
We go to Hong Kong, Spain, Buenos Aires,

514
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,950
基本上老板让我们去哪就去哪
basically wherever the boss tells us.

515
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,800
败家子一个
Corrupt son of a bitch.

516
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,290
那我建议你继续跑你的码头吧
Well, I suggest you get back on that tramp,

517
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,920
因为你不能去
'cause you're not coming. ‭

518
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,330
我告诉你  我能帮上忙
I'm telling you, I can help!

519
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,100
听我说  这可是中东
‭Listen to me, this is the Middle East.

520

今非昔比了  我现在可是国际成功人士
Lots has changed. I'm an international hitter now.

521
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,910
我很健谈
A raconteur.

522
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,600
你这就词不达意了
I don't think that means what you think it means.

523
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,450
别说的像我不懂法语一样  我懂法语
Don't speak to me like I don't know French, I know French.

524
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,630
我是棕色人种  这点很重要
And I'm brown, that's something.

525
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,440
我在那边会比你这个白种人更合群
I'll fit in better over there than you will, snowflake.

526
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,180
我之前说你三天内就得死
I decided I was wrong when I said

527
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,280
我觉得我错了
you would be dead inside of three days.

528
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,140
你去那边  一天就死了
You go over there, you'll be dead inside of one.

529
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,320
但是有我在就不同了  我们有人
But with me, we have people at the mosque

530
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,890
在那边的清真寺工作
that have worked over there,

531
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,100
我们有法律关系
people with legal connections

532
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,890
可以带我们进入监狱
that can get us inside of that prison.

533
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,790
等等  你别说他能跟着去吧
Hold on. You're not saying he gets to go.

534
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,480
论棕色人种  他比我像不到哪去
He's not any browner than I am.

535
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,540
{\an2}但你会说阿拉伯语吗

536
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,220
不会吧
No?

我在伊拉克当兵时  学了几句阿拉伯语

在厕所隔间里干倒他  不就完事了  
ragdoll him in one of stalls and be done with it.

550
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,050
那我们还得处理尸体
Then we'd have a body to deal with.

551

我们要让他彻底地消失  不留后患

552
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,670

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,840
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

615
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,980
我就收到了一个词  仅此而已
I got a single word. That's it.

616
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,760
我的捐助人只用了一个词来表明他们的身份
Just... my benefactors ID'd themselves by a single word.

617
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,880
乌提斯
Outis.

618
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,150
我查了一下
I looked it up.

619
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,640
这词在希腊语中代表"没有人"
It's Greek for "Nobody."

620
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,490
那就是你的捐助人  拜格威尔先生
That's who your benefactor is, Mr. Bagwell.

621
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,960
没有人
Nobody.

622
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,540
{\an5}卡尼尔·乌提斯

623
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,370
{\an5}专为"卡尼尔·乌提斯"度身定制

624
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,010
好了
Okay.

625
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,890

奥玛在奥杰吉亚监狱有些关系
Omar has connections in Ogygia Prison.

627
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,920
他说可以安排一次探视
He says he can arrange a visit.

628
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,940
意思是  迈克尔在那里吗
That mean Michael's in there?

629
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,020
很显然那里有个美国人
There's apparently an American in there

630
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,810
符合你弟弟的特征
matching your brother's description.

631
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,600
只是有个问题
There's just one thing.

632
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:19,530
安排这样的探视很难  非常难
Arranging such a visit is hard. Very difficult.

633
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,970
-需要付出一定的代价  -钱不是问题
- Comes at a price. - Money's not a problem.

634
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,020
不是钱的问题
Not money.

635
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,930
是你的护照
Your passport.

636
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,560
我的护照
My passport?

637
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,410
怎么  你想要拿着吗
What, did... you want to hold it?

638
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,120
不是  公平交易
No. Straight trade.

639
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,210
用探视换你的护照
Visit for your passport.

640
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,110
美国护照在这里等同黄金
U.S. Passport is like gold here.

641
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,150
做些修改  就是一张通往自由国度的机票
A few changes, and it can be a ticket to freedom.

642
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,670
别这么做  老林
Don't do it, Linc.

643
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,350
我知道这并不合你心意  但是
I know it is not ideal, but...

644
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,340
合心意这种事  在现在的也门早已成为历史
ideals as of right now are history in Yemen.

645
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,290
没有护照  你没办法离开也门
You cannot get out of the country without a passport.

646
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,540
别给他
Don't do it.

647
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,450
如果这是真主的旨意
Inshallah...

648
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,350
你很快就会见到你的弟弟
you will see your brother soon.

649
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,810
我告诉过自己  只要我们从监狱出去
I told myself I'd never step foot in another prison.

650
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,760
我就永不再踏进另一座监狱
As long as we walk out of it.

652
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,070
这里没有迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
There's no Michael Scofield.

653
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,470
这是为了要我的护照而设的骗局
It was a scam to get my passport.

654
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,570
奥玛是我最信任的手下之一
Omar is one of my most trusted operators.

655
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,350
听着  女士
Listen, lady.

656
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,360
信任似乎在这个国家一钱不值
Trust doesn't seem to mean a whole lot in this country.

657
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,910
等我一下  行吗
Give me a second, okay?

658
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,000
我会想个变通的办法
I'll figure out a way to work this thing out.

659
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,100
有张图片
An image.

660
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,610
对吧  他们发给你的那张
Right? The one that they sent to you?

661
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,040
-对  对  -你带了吗
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Do you have it?

662
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,460
看

对  卡尼尔·乌提斯  他在这里吗
Yes, Kaniel Outis. Is he here?

他说  对  图片中的男人就在这里
He says, yes, the man in the picture is here

666
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,330
我们可以去探视他
and we can see him,

667
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,890
但仅仅是因为我们跟希巴有交情
but only 'cause we're dealing with Sheba.

668
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,220
你为什么说这个名字
Why did you say that name?

669
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,120
是因为我弟弟的外套
Because of my brother's jacket.

670
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,280
还以为在这件事上  你们是站在真主这边的
Thought you were on the right side of God on this.

671
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,390
希巴  不  希巴
Sheba. No, hey, hey. Sheba...

672

Come on, C.

678
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,920
你知道那绝不是迈克尔
You know that's not Michael.

679
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,950
无论他是何方神圣
Well, whoever he is...

680
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,150
我们都要见到他了
...we're about to meet him.

681
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,850
我爸爸是个怎样的人

00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,670
我亲生爸爸
My real father.

迈克尔·斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield...

684
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,750
就像一场风暴

685
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,800
带上照相机

686

我想证明他还活着

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,570
他颜值爆表
He was beautiful

688
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,160
令人生畏
and frightening

689
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,350
神秘莫测
and mysterious.

690
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,460
他会从湛蓝的天空中
And he would show up in your life

691
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,890
现身于你的生命里
out of the clear blue sky

692
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,020
来无影  去无踪
and then he would disappear just as quickly.

693
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,470
但风暴还是能回来的
But storms, they can come back.

694
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,470
不是吗
Can't they?

695
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,980
问题是  如果回来了
Question is, if they come back,

696
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,450
那会是人面依旧呢
is it the same storm,

697
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,530
还是物是人非了呢
or has something changed?
