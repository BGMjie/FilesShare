00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,500
不  
No.

166
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,030
只是我们自以为是那样罢了
That's what we thought...

167
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,420
但我们都想错了
but we were wrong.

168
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,100
我娶莎拉几周前
A few weeks before I married Sara...

169
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,120
波塞冬联系了我
I was approached by Poseidon.

170
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,700
你觉得我肚子大了吗
You think I'm showing?

171
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,080
我还没习惯呢
I'm not used to that yet.

172
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,030
我得... 我得告诉迈克尔
I got to... I got to tell Michael.

173
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,640
-给你  汉堡马上就好  -喂
- Here you go. Burgers will be just a second. - Hello?

174
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,430
是的  我是迈克尔
Yes, this is Michael.

175
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,700
波塞冬告诉我凯勒曼并没有权限
Poseidon told me Kellerman didn't have the authority

176
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,830
或者司法权赦免我们的罪行
or jurisdiction to exonerate our crimes.

177
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,740
他利用这点作为在法律上要挟的筹码
He used that as a legal fulcrum.

178
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,610
告诉我他能在法律的权限范围内
Told me he could put us all away for life

179
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,230
把我们关一辈子  除非...
within the mandate of the law unless...

180
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,880
除非我为他效命
unless I went to work for him.

181
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,450
在这节骨眼上  他们到底能谈些什么
What the hell can they be talking about at a time like this?

182
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,280
我不知道
I don't know...

183
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,270
但大哥在听我想听的事
but big brother's hearing things I want to hear.

184
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,210
我们不能待着
We cannot stay.

185
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,820
我们必须现在走
We must go now.

186
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,340
或许我们不用
Maybe we don't.

187
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,440
你到底在说什么鬼话
What the hell are you talking about?

188
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,140
或许逃跑都只不过是推迟不可避免的宿命
Maybe all this running is just delaying the inevitable.

189
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,070
在这孤独而死  在家孤独而死[没分别了]
Die alone here. Die alone at home.

190
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,480
天啊  你需要个女朋友
God, you need a girlfriend, man.

191
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,950
那些声音朝着我们过来了
Those voices are heading our way.

192
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,490
他们就要找到我们了
They're almost on us.

193
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,050
这个波塞冬到底是何方神圣
Who the hell is this Poseidon guy?

194
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,720
一个变态
A psychopath.

195
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,380
中情局里一名不得志的政策专家
A frustrated policy wonk in the CIA

196
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,110
自认为他能比他的上司做得更出色
who felt he could do better than his superiors.

197
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,410
他在中情局内创建了一个叫"21号空间"的组织
So, he created a cell within the CIA called 21-Void,

198
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,740
执行他自己的情报行动
implementing his own intelligence operations.

199
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,280
而他需要我的帮助
And he needed my help

200
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,220
在世界各地把入狱的人救出来
breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.

201
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,260
恐怖分子
Terrorists,

202
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,000
持不同政见者
political dissidents...

203
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,780
叛变的特工
rogue agents...

204
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,290
如果我做了  你和莎拉  你们会自由
and if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.

205
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,150
抹掉你们的案底  但是...
Your record's expunged, but...

206
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,430
有个麻烦
there was a rubble.

207
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,950
不允许我和你们任何人联系
I wasn't allowed to have contact with any of you,

208
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,790
包括我儿子
including my son.

209
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,940
迈克尔
Michael.

210
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,150
所以当时迈克尔·斯科菲尔德"死了"
So, Michael Scofield was dead and...

211
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,700
这些年我用了很多化名
over the years I assumed many names.

212
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,890
最近就是卡尼尔·乌提斯
Kaniel Outis... the most recent.

213
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,390
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

214
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,640
为什么不联系我
Why didn't you reach out to me?

215
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,140
我别无选择
I didn't have a choice.

216
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,790
波塞冬的"意思"  表达得很清楚
Poseidon made that... very clear.

217
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,970
怎么回事
How?

218
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,290
最初  我拒绝了
At first, I said no.

219
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,820
我不肯干
I wouldn't do it.

220
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,420
没过几周  莎拉被关禁闭  被人打
Then within weeks, Sara was incarcerated, beaten.

221
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,260
所以我妥协了
And so I gave in.

222
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,910
我做的一切  都是为了家人
Everything I did, I did for family,

223
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,850
为了你  为了莎拉
for you, for Sara,

224
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,160
为了麦克  
for Mike...

225
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,900
这样你们就不用
so none of you would ever have to spend another day

226
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,640
在监狱度日
inside a prison cell or...

227
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,940
或者亡命天涯
or live a life on the run.

228
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,530
看看我们现在的处境
Look at us now.

229
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,440
他们要开始搜查建筑了
They're starting to search the buildings.

230
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,230

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,670
所有乘客必须出示机票

235
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,740
这样可上不去飞机  我们得从那穿过去

236

连飞行员都上不了飞机
Even the pilot can't get on the plane.

237
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,880

那个小滑头吗
That slippery brother?

243
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,400
现在能相信人可不容易
Trust is a luxury right now.

244
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,560
可以相信他  他能起一定作用

245
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,230
-他在沙漠那边的西海岸有关系  -不行
- He has connections on the western coast, across the desert. ‭- No.

246
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,960
林肯和迈克尔要来  这才是计划
Lincoln and Michael are coming here. That's the plan.

247
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,800
如果我们走了他们就不知道下一步怎么办了
They don't have a next move if we leave.

248

现在都还不知道他们在外面的什么地方
Now they're out there somewhere, God knows where.

249

你朋友来晚了  你看看周围

这机场可不是他们待的地方
This airport is no good to them.

那些西方人越狱后去了那

我在办假证的窝点碰到了他们中的一个

你觉得就凭你这一只眼睛
And how do you expect to find the foreigners

with only one eye?

如果你说的是实话  钱就归你
If you speak the truth, you'll have the money.

286
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,740
你作为模范穆斯林  动粗的情况有点多啊
You kick a lot of ass for a good Muslim.

你可以把人从街上除掉
You can take the man out of the streets,

288
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,590
但是街上不可能没有一个人

trying to get out of this madness,

292
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,570
但我们无法通过那些大门
but we're not gonna get out through those gates.

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,030
现在逃离的唯一办法就是坐飞机  兄弟
The only way out now is up, brother.

294
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,810
747没法起飞
The 747 is done.

295
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,980
有叛军把守
It's been secured by the rebels.

296
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,920
我不是说也门航空
I'm not talking about Yemenia Air.

297
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,990

Yeah, no, It's fine. I just-- it's been a crazy day,

303
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
我还忘记了迈克的西班牙语课
made more so by the fact that I forgot Mike's Spanish lesson.

304
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,110
-西班牙语课  -对啊

Well, let me get Mike's bag.

309

不了  别管它了  我明天过来拿
No, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it tomorrow.

310

I want you to get in the car

311
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,420
不管发生什么都别出来  好吗
and no matter what you don't get out, okay?

312

你急着去哪
Where you going so fast?

313
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,500

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,970
昨天系里的会议怎么样了
How was that department meeting yesterday?

316
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,590
你一般都和杀手开会吗
You usually meet with killers?

317
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,150
莎拉  莎拉  别这样  别这样
Sara. Sara. Please, please, please.

318
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,290
让我解释好吗  听我说
I can explain, okay? Just listen to me.

319
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,550
我担心死了
I was sick with worry.

320
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,340
我得保护你  保护我们的家庭
I needed to protect you, to-to protect our family,

321
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,170
我从那家数码店拿了你的手机
so I picked up your phone from the shop

322
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,400
交给了安德鲁·尼尔森
and I took it to Andrew Nelson,

323
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
他是我在计算机科学系的一个朋友
my buddy in the computer sciences department.

324
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,810
他做了深入追踪
He did a deep dive,

325
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,830
某种深度数据恢复  他成功了
some kind of data archaeology, and he did it.

326
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,230
他追踪到了那些混蛋
He tracked those bastards down.

327
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,010
找到了他们的手机信息
Got their cell information.

328
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,300
所以  我给他们打了电话
So... so I called them,

329
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,540
想着也许
thinking I could-I could maybe

330
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,530
-能和他们达成协议  -你还打他们电话
- make a-make a deal with them. - You called them.

331
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,040
莎拉
Sara?

332
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,400
莎拉  请听我说
Sara, please, listen to me.

333
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,510
莎拉  我这样做是为了你
Sara, this was for you.

334
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,220
你最好现在从我面前滚开
You're gonna want to get out of the way right now.

335
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,140
莎拉  莎拉
Sara. Sara!

336
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,090
{\an8}{\pos(75.005,198.718)}萨那火车站

337
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,990
就是这里
This is it.

338
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,440
我们离开这个国家的方法
Our ticket out of the country.

339
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,940
我告诉你  迈克尔  这是个坏主意
I'm telling you, Michael, this is a bad idea.

340
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,290
这里到处都是ISIL的人
ISIL are everywhere.

341
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,130
不  我们能行
No, I can do this.

342
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,250
你真的花了一千万里亚尔[4万美元]
You really paid the equivalent of ten million rial

343
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,630
买某人的骨灰吗
for some dude's ashes?

344
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,570
不是普通人的骨灰  兄弟
Not just any ashes, man.

345
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,300
是佛莱迪·摩克瑞的骨灰
Freddie Mercury's ashes.

346
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,570
花两倍的钱我都愿意买
I would've paid twice that.

347
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,100
来吧
Come on.

348
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,800
把头低下
Keep your head down.

349
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,590
我们现在该认清现实  往机场走了吧
I think it's time we get sane and head to the airport.

350
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,040
不  不  不
No, no, no.

351
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,800
这里更好  他们控制着火车站
This is better. They control the station.

352
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,800
他们绝不会猜到我们就在眼皮底下
They'll never think to look for us here now.

353
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,480
他们在利用这里改运货物  而非乘客
They're repurposing those trains for cargo, not passengers.

354
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,910
只要我们上了火车
Once we're on, it's...

355
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,570
我们就能一路向北
it's a straight shot to the north.

356
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,730
他们不会再检查车厢
They won't check the cars again.

357
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,830
这是你看到火车时所想到的吗
That's what you see when you see the train?

358
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,630
我只看到一群人拿着AK47步枪
I see a bunch of dudes with AK-47s

359
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,010
不像我们赤手空拳
who don't look a thing like us.

360
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,280
你真的相信我们能坐火车活着穿过
You really believe we can survive 300 miles on a train

361
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,190
483公里的ISIL领地吗
through ISIL territory?

362
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,650
这是自杀
Now that's suicide.

363
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,330
-是挺危险的  -没有开玩笑
- It does seem risky. - No kidding.

364
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,610
不  不
No, no.

365
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,260
我们混进搬运工的队伍  别抬头
We get in that line of cargo carriers. Keep our heads down.

366
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,300
一旦上了火车  一路上低调行事
Once we're on the train, lay low the rest of the trip.

367
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,340
另外  我们不需要扮得像他们一样
Besides, we don't need to look like them.

368
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,480
"告诉信徒们"
"Tell the believing men

369
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,550
"不要抬头  保持谦逊"
to lower their gaze and be modest."

370
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,740
走
Come on.

371
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,120
刚才那几句出自《古兰经》[伊斯兰教的最高经典]
From the Koran.

372
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,840
所有路都被封锁了
All the roads are blocked.

373
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,540
所以你们得另寻一条去边境的路
So you'll have to find a different way to the border.

374
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,380
搭火车
By train!

375
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,590
海瑟  现在怎么办
Heather, what now?

376
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,250
现在怎么办
What now?

377
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,090
我是说  这一切都是谎言  不是吗
I mean, it was all a lie, wasn't it?

378
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,260
所有事情  我们的生活  婚姻
Everything. Our whole life, our whole marriage.

379
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,910
他和那个朝他开枪的女人聊天时的距离
He was standing as close as you were to me right now,

380
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,480
也不过就像你我现在的距离一样
and he was chatting with the woman who shot him.

381
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,170
你是想说  他一手策划了自己被枪击
You're saying he planned to get himself shot

382
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,510
就像某种变态的表演吗
like it was some sort of, uh, sick performance?

383
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,470
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

384
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,120
我是说  我...
I mean, I...

385
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,430
-对  他就是在演戏  -但他差点死了
- Yes. Yes, it was. - But he almost died.

386
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,640
所以原计划只是轻伤他的手脚  对吧
So, the plan was to wing him, right?

387
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,110
帮他排除嫌疑  但枪击过了火
To just put him above suspicion, but the shot went wide.

388
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,910
他受了重伤
He gets hit.

389
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:51,970
-他知道他老婆是医生  -莎拉  别说了
- He knows that he's married to a doctor. - Sara, Sara, stop. Stop.

390
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,970
你三天没睡了  对吗
You haven't slept in three days, right?

391
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,160
你为持械入室的事感到不安
You're upset about the home invasion

392
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,630
你还因为你的爱人
and you're tying yourself up in knots

393
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,530
孩子的生父  可能还活着
because the love of your life,

394
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,030
而让自己操透了心
the father of your baby, might be alive.

395
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
而且我还联系不上林肯
And I can't get through to Lincoln.

396
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,030
但我看了那段视频
But I saw that video.

397
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,710
绝对是他
It's him.

398
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,070
-好吧  我...  -那就是迈克尔
- Okay, and I... - That's Michael.

399
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,430
我相信你  真的
And I believe you. I do.

400
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,920
-那很重要  -那是最重要的
- And that matters. - That's all that matters.

401
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,260
我知道
No, I know.

402
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,470
但雅各布是个好男人
But Jacob is a good man.

403
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,920
他是你丈夫
He's your husband.

404
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,940
-对  -他帮你开启了新的人生
- Yeah. - And he helped you start a new life.

405
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,480
携手同心

-我得去接  -不不不  别接

听着  这里有个天大的误会
Look, there's been a huge misunderstanding

给我回个电话
And to call me?

莎拉  亲爱的  我是你的闺蜜
Sara, honey. I'm your best friend.

418
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,590
他自然会先给我这打电话
Of-of course he's gonna call here first.

419
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
这不能表明他是内奸
It doesn't make him Deep Throat.

420
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,210
不如我们想想有没有更简单的解释
Listen, let's just see if there's a simpler explanation.

421
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,580
好
Okay.

好  我在那个系里有个老朋友
Okay, well, I have an old friend in that department.

只要一个电话就能查明雅各布有没有说谎
We can find out if Jacob's full of it in one call.

427
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,870

检查过了  燃料足够支撑我们离开也门
We checked. There's enough fuel to get us out of Yemen.

但我不能有那些顾虑
But I can't start thinking about that.

463
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,340
因为如果那样  一切都会完结
Because if I do, then it all falls apart

464
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,240
我们谁也回不了家
and none of us get to go home.

465
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,750
我必须集中注意  深谋远虑
I have to stay focused, be the man with the plan.

466
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,930
就像当年在福克斯河监狱一样
Just like Fox River.

467
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,850
还记得吗
‭Remember?

468
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,880
我们有车了
We got wheels.

469
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,960
好样的
Good work.

470
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,770
只能从机场走
The airport's the only play.

471
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,130
我们离机场8公里
The airport is five miles away.

472
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,470
离边境有好几百公里
The border is hundreds.

473
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,670
听着  机场或许是正确的选择
Look, the airport might be the right choice,

474
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,010
但我相信我的直觉
but I trust my instincts.

475
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,760
凭借直觉让我们活到现在
They've gotten us this far.

476
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,140
直觉告诉我仍然可以从北边突破
And my gut says we can still make it out through the north.

477
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,370
你们自己做决定
Choice is yours.

478
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,710
伙计  虽然我对你一无所知
Look, man, I agree with you,

479
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,000
但我同意你的想法  但是...
even if I don't know you from Adam. But...

480
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,070
既然都跟着他到这里了  所以...
got to go with the horse that got you here, you know? So...

481
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,060
我就跟着他了
he's my horse.

482
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,400
他是我见过最疯狂的人
Craziest horse I've ever met.

483
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,520
但也幸亏有他  才让我们活到现在
But got us this far.

484
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,070
只有不让你送命的疯狂才有用
Crazy only works if it doesn't get you killed.

485
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,670
{\an8}{\pos(60.005,198.718)}纽约州

486
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,670
{\an8}{\pos(74.005,253.718)}伊萨卡大学

487
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,320
安德鲁吗
Andrew?

488
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,130
海登教授说我们可以找你聊聊
Professor Hayden told us to speak with you?

489
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,120
没错  是的
Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, right.

490
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,220
不好意思
Sorry.

491
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,170
你好  安德鲁  我是莎拉·斯科菲尔德
Hi, Andrew. I'm Sara Scofield.

492
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,830
谢谢你愿意花时间见我
Thanks for taking the time.

493
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,450
不知道是不是真的
By any chance,

494
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,000
我丈夫雅各布·奈斯有没有让你查我的手机
did my husband Jacob Ness ask you to work on my cell phone?

495
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,540
是的  他有这么做  昨天吧
Yeah, he did, uh, yesterday.

496
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,180
他让你...
What did he, uh--

497
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,710
他让你做了什么
what did he ask you to do?

498
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,150
他说他想找出跟踪他妻子那些人的
He said he was looking to find the contact information

499
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,220
联络信息
for the people who were stalking his wife.

500
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,880
我做了深度数据追踪  把我能找到的给了他
So I did a data dive and gave him what I could find.

501
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,340
怎么做的
How?

502
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,170
他们黑进了你的手机  提取了数据
They hacked your phone and lifted the data,

503
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,600
但过程中留下了蛛丝马迹[电子特征码]
but in the process, left a very slight electronic signature

504
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,810
我能通过它顺藤摸瓜追踪到他们
that I was able to track back to them.

505
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,810
等等  "他们"是谁
Wait, who are "They"?

506
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,600
不知道  是个假的IP地址
Don't know. It was a dummy IP address,

507
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,750
但手机和位置是正确的
but the cell and location were correct.

508
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
这些逃不过我的眼睛
They couldn't hide that from me.

509
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,800
你老公打来的
The man himself.

510
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,810
喂
Hello.

511
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,840
莎拉  听我说  我知道你很不安
Sara, listen, I know you're upset,

512
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,610
但我需要你来一趟惠特尼海兹警局
but I need you to come to the Whitney Heights police station,

513
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,690
马上过来
right now.

514
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,150
拜托了
Please.

515
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,620
现在我们有时间聊聊了
So, now we got some time to talk.

516
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,370
你的名字叫迈克尔
Well, your name's Michael.

517
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,520
好吧
Cool.

518
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,250
你有个哥哥
You have a brother.

519
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,330
还有什么是我不知道的
What else don't I know?

520
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,930
真的  我得知道  长久以来  我这一路上
Serious, I need to know. I've been traveling so fast,

521
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,130
走得太匆忙  都没停下来想想你到底是谁
for so long, I didn't even stop to think who you really are

522
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,680
或我们到底在干什么
or what we're real doing here.

523
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,740
我甚至不知道  你为什么把我卷进这一切
I don't even know why you dragged me into all this, you know?

524
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,850
你得把过去  把细枝末节都忘了  维普
You got to forget the past, Whip, the details.

525
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,420
那些现在都不重要了
None of that matters now.

526
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,600
这么多年来  我都是怎么做的
What have my actions been all these years?

527
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,430
是谁一直事无巨细地照顾你
Who's been taking care of you through everything, huh?

528
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,320
是我  对吧
Me. Right?

529
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,210
对吧
Right?

530
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,580
对
Yeah.

531
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,700
一切都不曾改变
Nothing changes.

532
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:37,680
你依旧是我的得力干将
You're still my whip hand...

533
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,570
得力干将  我是你的得力干将嘛
Whip hand, yeah, I know, I'm your whip hand.

534
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,160
这招已经不好使了  兄弟
It's-- it's not good enough this time, man.

535
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,760
咱能直接打开天窗说亮话吗
Can you just give it to me straight?

536
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,140
我不是小孩子了  我能承受
You know, I'm a big boy, I can handle it.

537
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,090
你是我的得力干将是有原因的
There's a reason you're my whip hand.

538
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,060
一个能改变你一生的原因
A reason that's gonna change your life.

539
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,990
你一定会迎来"柳暗花明又一村"的那一刻
There's a light at the end of the tunnel for you.

540
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,330
搞什么鬼
What the hell was that?

541
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,390
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

542
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,740
赶紧跑
We got to go.

543
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,850
快走
Let's go!

544
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,650
没有出去的路  
There's no way out. ‭

545
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,210
医院后面已被炸了个粉碎  通道全堵了
Back of the hospital's been shelled to rubble. It's blocked.

546
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,850
楼上也堵了
Upstairs is blocked, too.

547
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,550
我们去下面
We're gonna go downstairs.

548
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,350
找找出路
Look for a way out.

549
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,490
咱们分头找
You do the same.

550
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,740
{\an8}惠特尼海兹警局

551
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,190
谢谢
Thanks.

552
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,520
怎么回事
What's going on?

553
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,990
莎拉  跟...
Sara, just...

554
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,680
跟我们来
just come with us.

555
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,530
你会明白的  拜托了
You'll see. Please.

556
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,350
女士您好  是莎拉·斯科菲尔德吗
Hello, ma'am. Sara Scofield?

557
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,520
是我
Yes, sir.

558
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,050
感谢您能来  我是凯南警探
Thanks for coming in, I'm Detective Kennan.

559
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,440
我们希望您能指认谁闯入了您家
We'd like you to point out who broke into your home.

560
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,520
还有
And...

561
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,930
朝您丈夫开枪的人
the one who shot your husband.

562
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,400
3号和4号
It's three and four.

563
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,550
那一男一女就是枪手
The man and the woman was the shooter.

564
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,930
确定吗
Are you sure?

565
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,760
是的
Yes, sir.

566
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,040
百分百确定
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

567
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,130
肯定会有出路
There's got to be a way out.

568
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,450
肯定有和路面相连的地方
Something-- something that connects to the surface.

569
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,430
往下找没用的  迈克尔
Going down's not gonna work, Michael.

570
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,490
我们得搞好埋伏  准备反击
We need to set up an ambush and fight.

571
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,910
是啊  武力永远是你的默认选择
Yeah, well, fighting is your default setting.

572
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,220
可拳头无法解决一切
It's not always about fists.

573
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,950
我说过了  没有出路
I'm telling you, there's no way out.

574
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,050
那就找个能打的玩意儿  傻瓜
Then find something to fight with, you idiot.

575
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,230
现在可不是玩这些"情趣游戏"的时候
I don't think it's that kind of a party,

576
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,860
但我喜欢你的品位
but I like your style.

577
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,210
你拿这个准备做什么
What are you going to do with that?

578
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,320
不知道
I don't know.

579
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,240
总比赤手空拳好
Beats a fist.

580
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,080
医用酒精吗
Rubbing alcohol?

581
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,380
你他妈想干嘛
What the hell are you doing?

582
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,890
你会瞎的  蠢货
You'll go blind, you idiot.

583
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,050
纯度才95%
It's only 95% alcohol.

584
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,880
我还不至于全瞎
I'll only go 95% blind.

585
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,860
那里  那有个通风井
There. There's an air shaft.

586
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,920
现在该武力登场了
Well, it's about fists now.

587
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,660
迈克尔吗
Michael?

588
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,400
不  是他们
No. It's them.

589
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,340
我的第一个恋人比我大很多
My first lover was much older than me.

590
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,500
他是我朋友的父亲
He was my friend's father.

591
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,050
他叫马西
Massi was his name.

592
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,120
这在当时是不为人知的
It was the greatest of scandals

593
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,870
最大的丑闻
that we kept to ourselves.

594
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,330
后来却被他妻子发现了
But his wife discovered us

595
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,040
告诉了她的兄弟们
and told her brothers.

596
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,790
马西被带到沙漠里
Massi was taken into the desert...

597
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,840
埋掉了
and buried.

598
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,160
是活埋
Alive.

599
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,280
他们用破布包着他的眼睛给了我
They brought his eyes to me in a rag.

600
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,680
我要你用那个杀了我
I need you to use that on me.

601
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,910
结束我的痛苦
End my suffering.

602
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,000
什么  这个吗
What, this?

603
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,750
雅说得对
Ja's right.

604
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,730
这种逃亡毫无意义
All this running is pointless.

605
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,210
你知道他们会在这怎么折磨我吗
Do you know what they will do to me here,

606
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,910
远不止挖眼这么简单
away from seeing eyes?

607
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,630
我不能
I can't.

608
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,410
我不会让那种事发生
I won't let that happen.

609
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,780
你明白吗
Do you understand?

610
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,840
我不会让它发生的
I won't let that happen.

611
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,750
听着  希德
Listen. Sid.

612
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
我不会放弃
I'm not giving up.

613
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,970
不管是不是同性恋  你也不能放弃
And queer or no, you're not, either.

614
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,150
他们才是错的
They're in the wrong.

615
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,960
不是你
Not you.

616
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,170
你要用那个干嘛
What are you gonna do with that?

617
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,500
*我已付出代价*
*I've paid my dues*

618
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,100
*一次又一次*
*Time after time*

619
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,800
*我已认罪服刑*
*I've served my sentence*

620
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,090
*却从未犯下罪行*
*But committed no crime...*

621
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,030
迈克尔  振作点
Michael, come on.

622
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,400
对不起  哥
I'm sorry, Linc.

623
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,790
我那时本该来找你的
I should have come to you.

624
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,630
波塞冬跟我交易的时候
I should've asked for your help

625
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,340
我就该去找你帮忙的  是我搞砸了
when Poseidon offered me the deal. I blew it.

626
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,250
那个时候  我想的是
At the time, I thought,

627
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,140
如果我自己来应对
if I dealt with it myself,

628
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,820
那痛苦只会留给我
the pain would only be mine.

629
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,310
但恰恰相反  我却打开了"潘多拉魔盒"
But instead I opened this Pandora's Box.

630
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,920
我本想让情况变好
I wanted to make it better,

631
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,710
但我只是让每个人的处境都变得更糟
but I only made it worse for everyone.

632
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,840
在这过程中
And somewhere in there...

633
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,870
我成了一个幽灵
 became a ghost.

634
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,870
我犯了很多错误
I made a lot of mistakes.

635
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,950
做了很多不明智不完美的选择
A lot of foolish, imperfect choices,

636
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,790
但所有这些...
but every one of them...

637
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,120
我做的所有这些都是出于爱
every one of them I made for love.

638
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,840
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

639
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,360
迈克尔
Michael,

640
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,430
你是我认识的最聪明的人
you're the smartest person I've ever known,

641
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,570
但你不能把所有担子都由自己来扛
but you can't carry the load on your shoulders alone.

642
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,620
你需要有人分担这些负担
You need to share the burden.

643
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,440
对
Yes.

644
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,780
这才是一家人
That's family.

645
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,420
这才是家人该做的
That's what family's for.

646
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,300
莎拉  我不知道你怎么想的  但是...
Sara, I don't know what you thought, but...

647
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,260
我只是一个担心妻子的丈夫而已
I'm just a husband who was worried about his wife.

648
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,760
没错  我本该早告诉你我要做的事  但...
And yeah, I-I should have told you what I was doing, but...

649
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,320
我感觉...
Look, I felt like...

650
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,780
一切都失控了
like everything was spiraling out of control

651
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,320
而我必须尽我所能去保护你
and I had to do whatever I could to protect you.

652
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,800
所以你觉得你该去联系两个职业杀手吗
So you thought you'd contact two hired killers?

653
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,290
我是想去扮演救星的角色
I was trying to play the white knight.

654
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,890
扮得并不好
Not very well.

655
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,490
这的确是疯了
And it was insanity.

656
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,870
我被吓坏了
I was scared to death.

657
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,930
我就是个哭鼻子的笨蛋
A-A blubbering idiot,

658
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,800
但我想他们可以用钱收买  知道吗
but I thought they would respond to money, you know?

659
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,140
无论给多少钱都行  只要能让他们放手
Pay them whatever it took to make them go away.

660
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,110
比他们已拿到手的还要多
More than they were already making:

661
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
五万美元
$50,000.

662
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,490
听我说  我...
Look, I, uh...

663
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,630
我在里面放了追踪器  莎拉
I had a tracker in it, Sara.

664
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,430
这个小东西
This little thing,

665
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,680
但他们没有碰它
but they didn't touch it.

666
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,970
我在碰面前就联系了警察
I contacted the police before the meet,

667
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,650
不管怎样我们抓到他们了
but we nailed them anyhow.

668
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,520
我们抓到他们了
We nailed them.

669
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,320
雅各布
Jacob.

670
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,620
我很抱歉让你经历了这些
I am so sorry I put you through this.

671
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,060
我们上吧
Let's do this.

672
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,190
扳手加管子来对抗AK步枪
A wrench and a pipe against AKs.

673
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,930
会很有趣的
It'll be fun.

674
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,560
我一直都想狠狠地痛扁这帮混蛋一顿
I've always wanted a crack at these bastards.

675
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,880
*我已付出代价*

00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,830
*却从未犯下罪行*
*But committed no crime*

680
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,630

You're gonna get yourself killed!

684
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:20,360
*我是自作自受*
*I've had my share of sand kicked in my face*

685
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,810
*但我熬过来了*
*But I've come through*

686
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,810

爱死你了  你这个日本疯子  太牛了
I love you, you crazy Japanese son of a bitch!

Whatever. I still love you.

694
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,460

More will be here soon.

What do we do now?

697
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,080
让我喘口气想想再做决定
I need to take a break from making decisions.

698
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,870
哥  要不机场吧
Linc, airport?

699
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,850
就机场
Airport.

700

有个人你得联系一下
I got someone I want you to talk to.

701

我真没想到这辈子还能再听到你的声音
Now that's a voice I never thought I'd hear again.

703
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,770
你可得好好跟我解释解释了  伙计
Man, you got some explaining to do, brother,

704
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,930
-居然搞出复活的套路  -很快就会的

去哪里找你
Where can we meet you?

706
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,450
2号飞机库  正对着主跑道
Hangar two. Right off the main runway.

707
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,000
但你们最好快点
But you better hurry your ass up.

我听到了你们打的电话  异教徒
I heard your call, infidel.

00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,430
你们就算"插翅"也难飞[坐飞机]
Wings will not carry you to safety.

718
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,840

别在这人渣身上浪费力气
Don't waste yourself on him.

活下去就是赢了他
You'll beat him by surviving.

你们都会死  听到了吗
You will die, you hear me?

733
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,500
你们都会死光光
You will all die!

734
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,300
他们正调集更多的卡车就位
They're moving more trucks into position.

735
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,260
不能再等了
‭We can't wait.

736

There won't be enough runway to take off.

我们必须走了
We must go now.

我欠林肯一条命  我不能抛弃他

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,480
但这么多人的性命安危全在我们手中
But with so many souls in our hands,

740
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,350
我们真的有选择吗
do we really have a choice?

741
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,170
听着  我们再等五分钟  好吗
Listen, we wait five more minutes. Okay?

742
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,890
之后就只能救一个是一个了
And then we take care of the souls that we can.

743
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,240
明白了吗
Understand?

744
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,030
你干什么呢
What the hell are you doing?

745
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,620
你干什么
The hell are you doing?

746
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,620
听着  我们不能丢下我朋友
Listen, we are not leaving my friends!

747
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,160
关掉  关掉它
Shut it down. Shut it down!

748
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,550
你会把我们都害死的
You would condemn us all to death.

749
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,540
你阻止我  谁都跑不了
If you stop me, no one gets out.

750
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,600
你朋友们还能跑得了  我们不行
Your friends can still make it to safety. We will not.

751
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,590
喂
Yeah?

752
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,900
钞票哥  你们得赶紧走了  伙计
C-Note? You got to get out of here, man.

W-We can do this thing, man. We can do it.

755
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,360
不  赶紧走  否则你和孩子们都得死
No! Go now! Otherwise, you and the kids are dead!

756
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,380
我们会另想办法
We'll work something out.

757
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,250
再艰难的路我们都挺过来了
We've been through worse.

758
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,990
林肯  对不起
Linc, I'm so sorry.

759

I'm so sorry, brother.
