00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,610
你这个懦夫
You coward.

316
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,910
穆斯塔法  拜托了
Mustapha, please.

317
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,660
懦夫
Coward!

318
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,460
我要进去
I need to get in!

319
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,720
我要出去
I need to get out!

320
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,660
给我钥匙
Well, give me the key.

321
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,450
我没有钥匙
I don't have the key.

322
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,000
带钥匙的人刚从你身边过去
You passed the guy who does.

323
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,120
退后  我不想杀你们
Stay back! I don't want to shoot you!

324
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,590
狱警们都跑了
The guards are gone!

325
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,190
他们放弃了坚守自己的岗位
They're abandoning their posts!

326
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,750
我们要重获自由了
We're gonna be free!

327
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,390
不  我们不会自由
No. We're not free.

328
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,940
情况只会变得更糟
Things just got a lot worse.

329
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,340
把门撞开
Push the gate open!

330
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,660
停下
Stop!

331
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,710
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

332
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,020
我们得冲出这道门
We have to get through the gate!

333
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,120
如果如他们所说
If ISIL controls the city,

334
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,400
ISIL掌控了这座城市  那出去也是监狱
like they say, it will be a prison out there as well.

335
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,420
我们会像过去在这一样被审判  而且只会更糟
We will be persecuted, as we have been in here, only worse!

336
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,580
至少还有一线生机
At least there's a chance!

337
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,740
你想要机会吗
You want a chance?

338
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,700
我们的机会在那  就在禁闭室里
Our chance lies in there, in solitary.

339
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,300
我们谈判的筹码
Our bargaining chip.

340
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,040
我们抓住阿布·拉马尔
We get Abu Ramal!

341
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,700
我们可以以此换取一条出城的路
We negotiate passage out of the country.

342
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,610
不  你疯了吧
No, it's madness.

343
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,220
来吧  我们齐心协力就能撞开这扇门
Come on. If we work together, we can push open the gate.

344
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,610
是你吗  小公举
Is that you, Princess?

345
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,040
就是你  我们记得他  对吗
It is you. We remember this one! Right?

346
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
-我们记得他  -求你...
- We remember him! - Please...

347
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,800
那个不愿意帮我弟的
Friend to Kaniel Outis,

348
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,040
卡尼尔·乌提斯的朋友
the man who would not lend my brother a hand!

349
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,400
在我看来  就是那个人害死了我弟  对吧
The man who killed my brother, as far as I'm concerned, right?

350
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,440
-我们要进去抓住阿布·拉马尔  -不
- We are going to go in there and get Abu Ramal! - No! Please!

351
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,190
-不  求你了  -等我们进去时
- No! Please! - And when we are there,

352
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,740
我要亲手割开卡尼尔·乌提斯的咽喉
I am personally going to slice Kaniel Outis' throat.

353
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,640
你将是那个帮我达到目的的人
And you are going to be the one who's going to help me do it.

354
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,220
-不  -你抓住他
- No! - You take him!

355
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,310
抓住他
Take him!

356
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,370
所有人听着
All of you!

357
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,120
你们要待在这里吗
Will you stay here?

358
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,370
你们要让ISIL杀了你们吗
And let ISIL slaughter you?

359
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,610
还是你们愿意与我联手
Or will you stand with me?

360
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,280
反抗到底
And fight!

361
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,580
听起来情况不妙
Doesn't sound very promising!

362
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,360
拉马尔  你要不要重新考虑一下帮我们
Ramal, you want to rethink helping us?

363
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,330
越狱必须从你的牢房里开始
Escape has to start from your cell!

364
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,160
你们这些异教徒都该下地狱
All you infidels can go to Hell!

365
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,190
我们已经身处地狱了  拉马尔
We are in Hell, Ramal.

366
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,230
问题是你想不想出去
Question is do you want out?

367
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,740
撞开这扇门
Smash through the door!

368
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,310
告诉我怎么做
Tell me what to do.

369
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,100
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}喂  警察

370
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,940
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}我不是警察

371
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,650
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}那你裤子上的条纹是怎么回事

372
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,940
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}证件

373
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,980
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}证件

374
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,780
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}快拿出来  不然我们开枪了  听懂了吗

375
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,200
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}他有枪

376
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,290
我谁的手机都没黑
I'm not hacking anybody's phones.

377
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,630
这件事上你大错特错了  根本不了解情况
You're so off base on this, you have no idea.

378
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,690
是吗
Am I?

379
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,130
是... 是的
Y-Yes.

380
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,310
对了  这太难喝了
That is terrible, by the way.

381
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,400
你这是做什么  想表达忏悔吗
What is that, an act of contrition?

382
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,490
想自我惩罚吗
Like a hair shirt?

383
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,010
用甘蓝汁折磨自己来弥补罪过吗
Torture yourself with Kale to make up for your sins?

384
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,810
我不再有任何罪过了  哥们
I don't have any sins anymore, man.

385
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,290
-有罪的是你  -那欺骗之罪呢
- That's you. - How about the sin of deceit?

386
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,800
白天是个名叫凯勒曼  喝甘蓝汁的人
A kale-drinking man named Kellerman by the light of day,

387
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,930
晚上却是中情局杀人不眨眼的禽兽波塞冬
a murderous CIA rogue named Poseidon at night.

388
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,110
波塞冬
Poseidon?

389
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,110
眼睛放光喽  被她说中了
His eyes light up. She was right.

390
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,410
你觉得我是波塞冬吗
Oh, you think I'm Poseidon?

391
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,630
好吧
Okay.

392
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,290
你是不是搅和进了波塞冬的事了
Are you mixed up with Poseidon?

393
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,350
这事还得要老办法解决吗
Oh, hell, we got to go old school with this?

394
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,200
你非要这样吗
Is that what you want?

395
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,810
尝尝哥的"断指神功"
T-Bag snapping fingers.

396
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,530
你刚给了我一点能配合你的线索
That's very-- you just gave me something to work with.

397
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,220
波塞冬吗  那就波塞冬
Poseidon? Poseidon.

398
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,480
我把我知道的波塞冬的事都告诉你
I'll tell you about Poseidon.

399
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,660
他是你在这个体制中能听说的传奇之一
I mean, he's one of those myths you hear about in the system.

400
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,270
这个特工触不可及
He's an operative so untouchable,

401
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,120
深不可测  就算你用核潜艇都找不到他
so deep, you couldn't find him with a nuclear sub.

402
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
所以才有了这个外号
Hence the nickname.

403
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,360
这跟我怎么扯上关系的
And how does this involve me?

404
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,650
他想要迈克尔做什么
What's he want with Michael?

405
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,820
拉马尔  仔细听着
Ramal, listen closely.

406
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,870
刻着"S"的那块砖  是松的
The brick with the "S," It's loose.

407
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,240
你得把它挪开
You got to remove it.

408
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,470
里面有一把勺子  一根绳子
It's a spoon, string.

409
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,130
怎么弄到的  
How?

410
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,660
绳子是四年来从我囚服上一丝一线拆下来积攒的
A string a day from my uniforms for four years.

411
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,100
勺子是好不容易趁狱警没注意拿到手的
A spoon a guard overlooked one time in a thousand.

412
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,460
你头顶上方有根水管
There's a water pipe above you.

413
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,000
钩住它  拽下来
Hook it, pull it down.

414
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,320
抓紧
Do it!

415
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,780
我确认一下  你这是要帮他逃出去吗
Let me get this straight. This is getting him out?

416
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,000
是让我们一起逃出去
It's getting us all out.

417
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,490
这活儿需要我和对面牢房的他合作完成
This is a two-cell job, mine and his.

418
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,290
所以当初我在他那个牢房时没能成功
That's why I couldn't pull it off when I was in that cell,

419
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,940
因为我对面这个牢房里的人不愿意合作
because the guy across from me, the guy in this cell, wouldn't cooperate.

420
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,920
我们必须合作
We have to work together.

421
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,840
来吧
Come on!

422
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,270
-不  -克劳斯
- No. - Cross!

423
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,820
我不会跟你合作
I'm not working with you.

424
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,280
不
No.

425
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,160
不
No.

426
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,620
过来  来吧  宝贝
Come here! Come on, sweetheart.

427
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,430
让他们看看你的漂亮脸蛋  来吧  上来
Show them your pretty face! Come on, get up here!

428
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,040
听着  赶紧给我停下
Look! Stop what you're doing

429
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,270
告诉卡尼尔·乌提斯我会杀了这"娘们"
and tell Kaniel Outis I will kill the girl!

430
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,110
抓住他
Take him!

431
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,130
来呀  我跟你还没完呢
Come on! I'm not through with you yet!

432
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,430
他们把希德打得不成样子了
They're beating the crap out of Sid.

433
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,050
我们不投降的话  他们会杀了他的
They'll kill him unless we surrender.

434
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,500
如果我们投降了  他们也会杀了我们
If we surrender, they'll kill us.

435
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,870
他们只想要拉马尔
They only want Ramal.

436
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,670
我们只有自己先逃出去才是救希德的最好办法
Our best chance of saving Sid is getting out of here.

437
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,250
让他们忘了他  追着我们跑
Make them forget about him, start chasing us.

438
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,800
很好
Okay, good.

439
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,070
捡起来  系上绳子  把它穿过去
Now pick it up. String the cord and pull it through.

440
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,230
快点  快点
Come on, come on!

441
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,300
好
Yeah!

442
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,350
我会杀了这"娘们"  我发誓
I will kill the girl, I swear it!

443
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
不
No!

444
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,290
我不会再重复
I won't say it again,

445
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,940
这个监狱里不许出人命
there will not be any killing in this prison!

446
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,550
在我眼皮底下就不行
Not on my watch!

447
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,300
这简直是疯了
This is completely insane.

448
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,690
外面简直乱成一锅粥了
It's a freakin' Mexican soap opera out here!

449
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,730
拉马尔  别停下  别动歪脑筋
Ramal, don't stop. Don't start thinking.

450
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,700
别把你的希望寄托在区区一个狱警身上
Don't pin your hopes on one guard.

451
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,810
走开
Walk away!

452
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,800
藏到牢房里去
Hide in the cell block!

453
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,030
你在干什么
What are you doing?

454
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,410
这监狱完蛋了  哥们
The prison is done, brother.

455
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,710
看在上帝的份上
For the love of God!

456
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,080
看在真主的份上  一个有志于寻求正义之士
For the love of God, a man seeks justice.

457
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,450
他的一举一动  无时无刻不在加以践行
In everything he does, at all times!

458
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,410
现在  所有人  都回牢区去
Now, everybody, back in the block!

459
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,720
不再有什么犯人和狱警了
There are no prisoners and guards anymore!

460
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,670
你意识到了吧
You realize that, right?

461
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,360
要是ISIL的人进来了
If ISIL gets in here,

462
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,040
我们都是他们的敌人
we are all the enemy,

463
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,850
都是罪人
sinners,

464
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,550
离经叛道者
deviants...

465
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,840
是把他们的领袖关起来的人
and those that locked up their leader.

466
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,520
而你是他们能抓到的唯一一个狱警
You will be the only guard that they catch.

467
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,360
有道德的狱警
The noble one.

468
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,770
他们会为此砍了你的头  但是...
They will behead you for it. But...

469
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,490
如果我们合作
if we work together,

470
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,330
抓住拉马尔
we get Ramal,

471
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,960
我们就有了谈判的筹码
we have a bargaining chip.

472
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,720
我会确保
I will see to it

473
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,530
你会和我们一起逃出去
that you will get out with the rest of us.

474
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,070
只要你给我禁闭室的钥匙
Just give me the keys to solitary.

475
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,050
-我没有钥匙  -我知道你有
- I don't have the keys. - I know you do.

476
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,350
加入我们  你就能活下去
Join us and you will live.

477
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,840
我向你保证
I give you my word.

478
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,640
我没有钥匙
I don't have them.

479
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,930
杀了他
Kill him!

480
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,500
但你有更好的东西  对吧
But you have something much better, huh?

481
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,800
让开  让开
Move. Move!

482
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,990
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

483
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,380
天啊  他们杀了那个狱警
Oh, my God. They killed the guard!

484
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,240
还拿了他的枪  冲着我们来了
They got his gun! They're coming for us!

485
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,180
得把握这个时机啊  拉马尔
Got to make this count, Ramal.

486
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,510
把"钓鱼竿"从那个槽里穿出来
String that fishing pole through that slot.

487
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,130
就这样
That's right.

488
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,720
这样你就可以把我门轴上的小齿轮去掉
Now, you can remove the pinions on my door-- the hinges.

489
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,990
有两个
There are two of them.

490
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,450
行不通
No way.

491
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,880
你想干什么
What are you doing?

492
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,380
你想干什么
What are you doing?

493
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,500
我要去掉我自己的
I'm doing mine.

494
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,460
我们没时间这么瞎折腾了  拉马尔
We don't have time for this, Ramal!

495
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,030
我说了这活儿要两个牢房合作  这才是关键
I'm telling you, it's a two-cell job, that's the point.

496
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,990
那一侧是新建的
That side of the wing is new construction.

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,260
小齿轮被做在门轴铰链里  你没法拔出来
The pinions are covered in the hinges-- you can't pull them.

498
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,830
这边是原来建的  门轴是开的  很松
This side is original. They're open, loose.

499
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,290
你想让我放你出来吗
You want me to free you?

500
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,320
对  然后我用那边的钥匙把你的门打开
Yes, and I, in turn, free you with those keys, down there.

501
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,390
你就比外面的疯子可信吗
Why would I trust you more than the madman out there?

502
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,170
因为你刚也听出了他是多么言而无信
'Cause you just heard what his word is worth.

503
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,140
踢开它
Kick it.

504
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,520
就这样了  就看你相信谁的话了
This is it. It's all about whose word you trust.

505
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,230
我保证  只要你放了我
I promise you-- you release me,

506
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,150
我就放了你
I release you.

507
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,210
再来一点  再来一点
Little more, little more.

508
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,610
谢天谢地  快
Thank God. Come on.

509

Okay, the bottom.

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,700
把我的门打开
Open my door.

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,890
别管他了  你疯了吗  
Leave him, man, you crazy?

523
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,390
把我的门打开
Open my door.

524
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,140
等我们逃出了监狱
Once we're outside these walls,

525
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,220
我们需要安全逃出这个国家
we need safe passage out of the country.

Even now, you negotiate.

552
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,660
你要打个电话
You're gonna make a phone call

553

613
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,980
比如说你认为俄罗斯和伊朗
Let's say you think Russia and Iran

614
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,650
对中东的影响太大了
are having too much influence in the Middle East,

615
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,460
而你觉得华府不会把事情办好
and you don't think Washington is getting the job done.

616
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,910
那你就会放走拉马尔
You free Ramal.

617
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,410
没错  他的确是个伊斯兰激进份子
Sure, he's an Islamic radical nut job,

618
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,650
但他会为你去对抗伊朗和俄罗斯
but he will fight Iran and Russia for you.

619
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,160
敌人的敌人即为朋友
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

620
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,500
而波塞冬最狡猾之处在于
And what's so shrewd about Poseidon

621
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,410
他做事不用任何网络
is he does it all without a network,

622
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,030
这也是他为什么这么难找的原因
which is why he's so hard to find.

623
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,460
区区一个人能操控到这个地步吗
One man can pull strings like that?

624
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,850
一个人操控一堆人
One man manipulating a handful of others.

625
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,300
阿布·拉马尔是个大魔头
Abu Ramal is a monster.

626
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,060
他就该下地狱
And there's a spot in Hell reserved for him,

627
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,250
不过最该堕入十八层地狱深处的要数波塞冬了
but the hottest spot is reserved for Poseidon,

628
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,970
因为他想放任拉马尔再一次搅乱这个世界
because he is letting Ramal loose on the world again.

629
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,570
那些人  他们的手上沾满了
Those men, they have the blood of thousands,

630
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,510
千千万万人的血
thousands on their hands.

631
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,770
跟他们比起来  你和我算得上两个天使
Compared to them, you and me are a couple of angels.

632
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,100
"天使"
"Angels"?

633
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,240
你弄清楚波塞冬是谁
You find out who Poseidon is,

634
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,170
斯科菲尔德又是怎么卷进去的
and how Scofield is wrapped up in it,

635
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,860
也许你的命运
maybe your fate...

636
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,210
就是要当个爱国者
is to be a patriot.

637
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,140
怎么...
What...?

638
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,810
跑  快跑
Go. Go!

639
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,580
万事万物皆有时[上天自有安排]
There's a time for everything.

640
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,570
911吗  我需要帮助  要快
911? I need help... now.

641
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,720
他们要从上面翻过去
They're going over the top.

642
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,280
我们走
Let's go.

643
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,970
快走  快走  快
Go, go, go, go, go!

644
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,700
这边
This way!

645
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,090
锁住了
It's locked!

646
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,860
是条死路
It's a dead end.

647
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,930
不  不  不  糟了  糟了
No, no, no, no. No. No, no, no, no.

648
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,300
拉马尔
Ramal?

649
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,550
藏起来
Hide!

650
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,150
我不想杀你  只想杀你的同伴
I don't want to kill you! Just your friends.

651
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,340
明白吗  
You understand?

652
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,950
希德  你还活着啊
Sid, you're alive?

653
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,560
-能活多久还不一定呢  -拉马尔
- We'll see about that. - Ramal?!

654
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,840
我们把那混蛋交出去吧
Let's hand the son of a bitch over.

655
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,850
没用的
Won't work.

656
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,070
他们还是会杀了我们
They'll gun us down anyway.

657
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,300
那也不能在这等死啊
Can't just wait here and die.

658
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,200
你的戏演到头了
Your game is up.

659
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,460
赶紧出来
Come out!

660
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,480
任何挡在我和阿布·拉马尔之间的人都得死
Anyone who gets between me and Abu Ramal dies.

661
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,100
听懂了吗
You understand?!

662
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,350
拉马尔人呢
Where is Ramal?

663
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,750
快说
Tell me now!

664
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,990
有个男孩
There's a boy.

665
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,840
麦克·斯科菲尔德  在纽约州伊萨卡
Ithaca, New York. Mike Scofield.

666
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,420
要是我不能活着出去
If I don't make it out of here alive,

667
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,220
告诉他  他父亲很爱他
tell him his father loves him very much.

668
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,500
"他父亲"
"His father"?

669
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,990
如果我不阻止他开枪
If I don't smother that gun,

670
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,450
我们都得死
they'll kill us all.

671
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,990
后退
Move back!

672
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,520
后退  跑
Move back! Go!

673
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,920
让我过去
Let me through!

674
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,160
迈克尔  迈克尔
Michael! Michael!

675
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,850
迈克尔  迈克尔
Michael? Michael!

676
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,540
波塞冬派你来的吧
Poseidon sent you?

677
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,880
你朋友呢
Where's your friend?

678
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,130
他早跑了
He's long gone.

679
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,750
后门
Back door.

680
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,670
从里面锁住了
Locked from the inside.

681
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,420
他还在这里
He's in here.

682
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,290
找到他
Find him.

683
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,270
我也曾和你一样  为谎言而杀戮
I was you once, killing for a lie.

684
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,540
那你现在算什么
Now you're what?

685
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,170
为真相献身吗
Dying for the truth?

686
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,270
人总有揭开真相的天性
It's human nature to find stuff out,

687
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,210
你也会揭开真相
so you will.

688
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,480
或者她也会
Or she will.

689
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,710
到那时  为谎言卖命的就得杀死揭开真相的
And then the lie has to kill the truth.

690
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,890
你们两个中  谁会被谁杀死...
Which one of you is gonna die ne--?

691
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,470
该撤了
Time to get scarce.

692
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,960
他跟你说什么了
What did he say to you?

693
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,170
没什么
Nothing.

694
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,180
汽修店就在前面几条街
Auto shop's a few blocks up.

695
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,080
你的人最好在赶来的路上
And your men better be coming.

696
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,040
他们会赶到那的
They will be there.

697
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,100
雅去哪了
Where is Ja?

698
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,950
雅
Ja,

699
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,000
-你干什么呢  -我快饿死了
- what are you doing? - I'm starving, man.

700
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,840
知道我多久没见过水果了吗
You know how long it's been since I seen fruit?

701
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,300
你停下来就为了吃东西吗
You're stopping to eat?

702
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,850
你嗑药嗑疯了吗
Are you high?!

703
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,310
别质问我  你又不是我妈
Don't come at me, man. You're not my mama.

704
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,300
告诉你吧  你完了
You know what? You're done.

705
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,320
-你滚吧  -什么
- You're gone. - What?

706
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,370
-等等  -我让你滚  你就是个负担
- Wait. - I said, walk! You're a liability!

707
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,360
等等
Wait. Wait.

708
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,770
你说过要救我出来
You said you'd get me out,

709
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,790
送我到家的  我们说好的啊
all the way home. That was the deal.

710
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,400
拉马尔  这个人再跟着我们
Ramal, this man follows us,

711
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,610
就让你的人杀了他
tell your men to shoot him.

712
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,460
乐意之至
Gladly.

713
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,520
{\an5}我们逃出生天之法
就藏在工作台下面

714
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,610
你去哪了  迈克尔
Where'd you go, Michael?

715
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,220
你跑哪去了
Where'd you go?

716
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,260
{\an5}我们逃出生天之法
就藏在工作台下面

717
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,650
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}举起手来

718
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,480
弟兄们  你们来了啊
There you are, my men.

719
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,070
抓住这些狗东西  他们该死
Seize these dogs so that we can put them down.

720
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,040
{\an2}{\pos(192,235)}举起手来  异教徒

721
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,020
拉马尔
Ramal.

722
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,040
拉马尔  你想干什么
Ramal, what are you doing?

723
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,850
你以为你能骗得过我吗
You thought you tricked me?

724
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,370
你绕了远路...
Take the long way around...

725
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,180
好让你的朋友...
while your friend...

726
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,320
先来这里拿武器
gets here first to get weapons.

727
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,750
你当时就是想坑我
You were going to screw me.

728
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,490
你们的美国俚语就是这么说的  对吧
That's the American slang, isn't it?

729
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,980
当时是你想坑我
You were gonna screw me.

730
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,650
看来我们俩的话都不可信
So much for our word.

731
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,800
对敌人撒谎
Lying to enemies.

732
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,070
这叫神圣的谎言
It's called Taqiyya.

733
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,650
打开照相机拍摄
Take off the camera.

734
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,500
我会让世界看到
I will show the world

735
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,340
耍阿布·拉马尔
what happens

736
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,650
是什么下场
when you screw Abu Ramal.

737
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,550
跪下
On your knees!

738
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,970
-想都别想  -让他们跪下
- It's not gonna happen. - Make them on their knees!

739
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,340
够了
Enough!

740
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,430
放下武器
Drop your weapons.

741
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,680
离我弟弟远点
Step away from my brother.

742
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,320
哥
Linc.

743
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,660
你有多爱你弟弟
How much do you love this brother of yours?

744
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,210
你最好下车
Why don't you step down from that truck?

745
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,670
停  停下  都住手
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

746
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,620
不  这样下去不行  懂吗
No, it's not going down like this, okay?

747
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,420
住手  我还有好多问题要问我朋友
Just... stop. I got way too many questions for my friend here.

748
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,300
退后
Step back!?

749
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:04,440
我因在酒吧斗殴打死一个人进了监狱
I went to prison for killing a guy in a bar fight.

750
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,070
我甚至没想要打架  懂吗
I didn't even want to get into it, okay?

751
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,930
当时他张嘴就对我马子爆粗口
He starts talking yang to my girl.

752
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,970
我让他滚蛋
I tell him to beat it.

753
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,830
他拔了刀  我怒火中烧
He pulls a knife, and I see red.

754
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,560
下一秒
One second later,

755
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,370
我拿着他沾满血的刀  他的尸体倒在地上
I'm holding his bloody knife, and it's his body on the ground.

756
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,910
-你的身手可没那么快  -是秒杀啊
- You're not that fast. - One second.

757
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,260
拜托别这样干
Please don't do this.

758
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,240
你会输
You will lose.

759
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,870
听听你朋友说的
Listen to your friend.

760
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,900
我是在对你说  拉马尔
I'm talking to you, Ramal.

761
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,600
我说过了  从卡车上下来
I told you! Step down from that truck.

762
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,090
拿起你们的武器
Pick up your weapons!

763
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,090
你还有一秒钟时间不让那一秒的事发生
You've got one second till that one second happens.

764
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,150
去死吧
Go to hell.

765
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,150
他们的援兵来了
We got more coming!

766
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,810
