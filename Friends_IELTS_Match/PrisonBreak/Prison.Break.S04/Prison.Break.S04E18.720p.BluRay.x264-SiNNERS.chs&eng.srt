你就不能让我来处理吗
You couldn just let me handle this?

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,120
如果你的处理办法就是把"锡拉"给将军

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,540

如果克兰兹将军不再是个问题呢

17
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,160

但现在有人想杀我

23
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,490
将军应该知道

别来找我们的麻烦

25
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,660
我不是将军派来的
The general didn't send me.

克里斯汀娜会让公司改头换面

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,850
她在什么地方

拿到他的电话了  我们快离开

-我们快走  -快点

47
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,740
她冬天才会来  所以...

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,600
你们两个是大学同学吗

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,180
医学院同学
Uh, no, just medical school.

她在纽约工作
She's got a practice in new york

53
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,350
她每年来这里一次
And she comes down here

开研讨会
Once a year to teach a seminar.

沙滩  太阳  便宜情侣装

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,890
我们有一天也可以像他们一样
We could have that if we wanted... someday.

59
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,480
验孕棒

60
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,350
斯图亚特  请坐

61
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,450
"锡拉"在迈阿密
Scylla is in miami.

62
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,020
我们的人正在仔细搜查
Our people are combing the city as we speak.

63
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,390
我听说了
Yes, i've heard.

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,530
有人想造反
Someone's atmpting a hostile takeover.

65

68
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,650
乔纳森
Jonathan...

69
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,040
我们卸除了你的电话
We're dumping your cell phone.

70
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,000
我们找到好几条
We've already found several phone calls

71
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,080
你和其他组织的电话联系
Between you and an unknown party.

72
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,360
斯图亚特  "锡拉"在谁手里
Stuart... who has scylla?

73
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,170
我不知道
I don't know.

74
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,520
好好想想
Think, buddy.

75
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,740
动脑子
Think.

76
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,020
我发誓我真的不知道
I swear i don't know anything.

77
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,480
我可以让你毫无痛苦地死去
This can be as painless As you want it to be.

78
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,760
"锡拉"在谁手里
Who has scylla?

79
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,770
你对这件事有点偏激了
You have gone around the bend on this.

80
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,450
我还没开始呢
I haven't even started yet.

81
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,930
林肯  这个人不是想伤你
come on, linc, this guy wasn't trying to hurt you.

82
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,010
他只是讨厌你的纹身
He just didn't like your tattoo.

83
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,100
-你真有意思  赛尔夫  -狙击手的电话记录里
You're a funny guy, self -there's a lot of calls

84
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,360
有个不明电话打了很多次
On the sniper's cell from a blocked number.

85
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,360
得让公司帮我们查
We'll need the company to help identify it.

86
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,660
万一是你妈的电话呢  林肯
What if it's your mom's cell phone, linc,

87
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,160
我们得去拜访一下
And we have to pay a visit?

88
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,690
你敢去吗
You got the gumption?

89
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,170
喂
Yeah.

90
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,790
林肯  我不喜欢主动打电话给你
Lincoln, i don't like having to initiate these calls.

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
那就别打  我们找到了再打给你
Well, don't. we'll call you when we get it.

92
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,930
"锡拉"在谁手里
Who has scylla?

93
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,880
我们不知道
We don't know,

94
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,430
但我们找到了一个狙击手
But we tangled with a sniper.

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,940
你们现在正在审问吗
Whom you're interrogating right now, right?

96
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,520
他死了
He's dead.

97
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,140
林肯  我们的行动目标
Lincoln, the point of this action

98
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,640
不是去杀人
Is not to kill as many of them as you can!

99
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,450
你的方法让我怀疑
Your methods make me question

100
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,400
你有没有能力
Whether you are capable of playing

101
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,530
来领导这么大的行动
On a field of this size.

102
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,580
我们会找到"锡拉"
We'll get scylla.

103
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,310
我今天就要答案
I want answers today.

104
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,460
你是不是有些话不敢说
Aren't you leaving something out,

105
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,960
一些有点敏感的话题  比如说
Something a tad critical, like it's your mom

106
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,750
"锡拉"就在你妈的手里
Who has scylla, hmm?

107
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,220
-你想多了  -那我们就谈谈
Don't think too much. let's talk about that.

108
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,080
是我想多了吗
Let's talk about thinking too much, okay?

109
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,140
你跟将军拖延时间  
Are you stonewalling the general 'cause it's good

110
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,750
是为了我们大家  还是为了
For the team here, or are you protecting the woman

111
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,760
当初生你的那个女人
Who popped you out lo these many years ago, huh?

112
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,710
要不是克兰兹让你来  我就杀了你
If krantz didn't put you here, i'd kill you.

113
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,770
住手
All right, all right!

114
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,010
这就是我想要的答案
There's my answer.

115
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,350
如果告诉克兰兹"锡拉"在克里斯汀娜手里
if we tell krantz That christina has it, he may know things that'll

116
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,240
他要么会帮我们  要么觉得我们不再有利用价值
help us or he may determine that we're no longer useful.

117
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,010
大家明不明白
Everybody understand that?

118
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,770
我们是来找"锡拉"的  我们一定要找到
We're here to get scylla, we need scylla,

119
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,360
所以必须按原计划行动
And the way to do that is to stick to the plan

120
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,270
而且不能走漏风声
And to keep our mouths shut.

121
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,590
看这个
Hey, look at this.

122
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,170
昨天他在亚利桑那  4号公路附近的
Yesterday he found us on interstate 10,

123
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,330
10号洲际公路上发现我们
Near route 4 in arizona.

124
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,800
MS是你名字的缩写
And "ms" are your initials.

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,430
但剩下的部分就没什么头绪了
But the rest of this could mean anything.

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,520
我去查查洛克威尔然后再想办法
I'll do a search on rockwell and we'll figure it out.

127
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,720
假设林肯也没有什么主意
Assuming lincoln hasn't already.

128
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,020
他在这里三天了
He's been here three days

129
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,750
还有公司做后盾
And he's got access to company resources.

130
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,900
如果他想要什么  那他一定能的手
And once he puts his mind to something, that's it,

131
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,950
就算他知道他的想法是错的
Even if he figures out he's wrong.

132
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,950
不过  目前为止
Well, and from what i've gathered,

133
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,230
他还没这个觉悟
He doesn't think he is wrong,So...

134
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,780
如果我是"MS"  那谁是"VS"
If i'm ms, then who's vs?

135
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,240
孟加拉语有14个元音
Bengali has 14 different vowels.

136
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,190
想学会真是折磨人
It's a bitch to pronounce.

137
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,850
林肯跑掉了
Lincoln got away.

138
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,540
你看过超新星的照片吗
Have you ever seen picture of a supernova?

139
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,540
看过
I have.

140
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,380
真的很漂亮
They're quite beautiful, aren't they?

141
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,050
而且很少见  
They're very rare; they only occur

142
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,450
50年才出现一次
About once every 50 years.

143
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,000
还有一天  我们就能目睹这样的奇观
We're a day away from a kind of supernova.

144
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,360
在它面前  一切都会黯然无光
A moment so powerful it'll eclipse everything.

145
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,640
而且没有人能阻止我
And nobody's going to stop me.

146
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,860
没有吗
No?

147
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,230
他们还没收到
They haven't got it yet.

148
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,790
我已经发了两次了  每次都...
Well, i've sent it twice already. either they...

149
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,080
收到了  收到了
They got it. they got it. okay.

150
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,630
帮我们调查狙击手的通话人
We need you to trace who called the sniper's cell

151
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,850
还有他在迈阿密的落脚点
And tell us where he is in Miami.

152
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,030
什么时候
Well, when?

153
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,200
不行
No.

154
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,110
完全不行  我们现在就要  我们...

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,710
他不来
He's not coming.

177

你来这干吗
Why are you here?

181

首先想警告你

你来告诉我

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,190
你母亲

188
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
锡拉在她手上

他不会来的

因为你的...
To stay alive because your...

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,340
你母亲要杀他
Because your mother tried to kill him.

196
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,760
如果你的计划不够周密
And if you stay here with some half-baked plan,

197
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,760
她也会来杀你
She's gonna try and kill you.

198
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,380
你来这干吗  阿历克斯
What are you doing here, Alex?

199
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,460

打听点信息  任何有用的信息

都能得到自己想要的  我们不必在
What they want here. we don't have to chose between

205
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,310
挽救家庭和推翻公司之间选择
Saving our families and taking down the company.

206
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,720
可以同时做到
We can do both.

207
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,860
怎么做
How?

208
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,530
目的达成时就知道了

209
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,870
所以我请求你  拜托了
That's why i'm asking you, please,

210
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,230
相信我
Trust me.

211
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,240
你有什么消息吗
Now, do you know anything?

212
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,290
任何消息
Do you have anything?

213
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,320
我唯一能告诉你的
The only thing i can tell you is

214
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,830
就是我们会彻底扳倒公司
That we're gonna burn the company down to the ground,

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,400
有你没你都一样  阿历克斯
And that's with or without you, Alex.

216
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,640
迈克尔  关于你母亲
I'm sorry, Michael.

217
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,410
我很遗憾
About your mother.

218
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,180
昨天搞得像警察的家伙
So, the guy who was posing as a cop

219
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,290
肯定是我母亲的人
Yesterday must have been working for my mother.

220
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,900
对  我觉得你说对了
Yeah. yeah, i think you're right.

221
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,650
如果他接受
And if he was following

222
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,410
她的指令  那么
Her instructions, that means...

223
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,610
我猜
Guess that means

224
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,300
她想把我们转移到某处
She wanted the two of us transported somewhere.

225
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,660
至少她没想过杀我们
At least she didn't want us killed.

226
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,560
我应该很感激了
I guess i should be grateful.

227
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,840
这能改变什么吗
Does this change anything?

228
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,340
不能
No.

229
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,540
她从公司内部
The fact that she thrived

230
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,880
兴起并控制公司  代价却是
Within the company, at the expense of...

231
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,470
其他所有人的性命
Everyone else...

232
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,540
这让我更想扳倒公司了
...makes me want to take them down even more.

233
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,830
洛克威尔大街  南迈阿密
Rockwell Avenue, south Miami.

234
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,170
走吧
Let's go.

235
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,640
公司给我们的手机卡信息
All right, the SIM card information the company gave us

236
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,510
显示我们要找的人就在几个街区附近
Said this guy should be a couple of blocks over.

237
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,040
这家伙最好是
This better be the guy who

238
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,640
你找到的那个线索  林肯
Ordered the lead on you，Linc.

239
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,480
-别是什么送披萨的  -你就不能闭嘴啊
- Not some pizza delivery boy. - Why don't you just shut up?

240
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,750
行了  听着  他快停下了
All right, listen, he's stopping.

241
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,910
林肯  你再向前开4分之1英里
Lincoln, you're gonna make a right

242
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,220
然后向右转
About a quarter of mile up.

243
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,880
是什么地方
What's the location?

244
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,740
我也不知道  但是很大
I don't know, but it's big.

245
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,730
门上的印章是哪的
Whose seal is that?

246
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,180
印度  这里是大使馆
India. This is the embassy.

247
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,420
他在那呢
All right, there he is.

248
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,650
看谁和他一起呢
And look who he's with.

249
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,750
锡拉在她手里
She's got Scylla.

250
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,060
-我们得想办法进去  -不行
- We need to get in there. - No, no, no, no, no, no.

251
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,090
她进去了肯定还会出来
Okay, if she's going in, she's gonna come back out.

252
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,190
等她出来我们再上
And when she does, we take our shot.

253
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,760
我在福克斯河监狱学到的一件事就是
One thing i learned at Fox River-- just 'cause

254
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,430
有些东西是有去无回的
Something goes in, don't mean it always comes back out.

255
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,700
说的对
You're right.

256
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,900
说啥  再说一遍
Hark, what was that? One more time?

257
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,970
她现在带着锡拉
Look, she's got that thing on her.

258
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,620
我们必须现在行动
We need to move now.

259
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,780
我们得分散他们的注意力
We need to create a distraction.

260
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,630
准备好了吗  帝博格
Self ready to go, T-Bag?

261
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,190
不  你让我说什么
No, no, no, no. Well, what do you want me to say?

262
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,850
想到哪说到哪吧
Just run your mouth.

263
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,320
你知道怎么做
You know how to do that.

264
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,490
我们进去了就通知你
Look, when we get in, we'll let you know.

265
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,890
在此之前  别让他们闲着  自己想办法吧  好吧
Until then, you keep 'em busy. Figure it out,okey?

266
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,160
拜托  唐
Oh, come on, Don.

267
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,070
这我可不在行
I don't know about that.

268
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,680
你能行的  自己想办法
You'll be fine. Just figure it out.

269
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,970
打扰下
Excuse me?

270
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,070
打扰下  先生  我要见你们的总统  
Excuse me. I'd like a meeting with your president, sir.

271
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,590
您能传达一下我来了吗  谢谢
Uh... Could you notify him I'm here? Thank you.

272
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,170
我们的总统不住美国  先生
The president doesn't live in America, sir.

273
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,240
她住在喀什米尔
She lives in Kashmir.

274
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,240
是个女的啊
She? Oh, well.

275
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,800
这就清楚多了  听着
That explains a lot, don't it? Listen,

276
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,630
老印  我不想跟你计较
Haji, I got no beefs with you, okay?

277
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,980
但对于一个有思想的人
It's just, there comes a point when a thinking man

278
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,420
必须表明自己的立场
Has to take a stand.

279
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,860
知道还有什么谁有思想吗  大象
You know who else thinks? Ephants.

280
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,360
没错  大象
That's right. Elephants.

281
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,580
你知道大象的大脑是
You know, they have the largest brain

282

整个动物王国中最大的么
In the whole animal kingdom?

你知道吗
Did you know what?

284

-先生  -你们印度人一直

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,440
不善待这种神圣的生物

00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,180
到现在为止  没有人站出来说话
And up till now, no one's been lifting a finger.

288
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,330
一直没有

走

299
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,960
先生  美国领土在路的另一头
Sir? sir? America's on the other end of that sidewalk.

300
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,700
这里是国际领土

302
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,370
我不跟你发牢骚  好吧
I have no-no gripes with you at all, okay?

303
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,170
我一直给国会议员打电话
I've been calling my Congressman.

304
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,740
我一直写信给联合国
I've been writing United Nations.

305
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,040
我不管
I don't care.

306
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,460
你知道大象
Did you know that elephants eat

307
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,910
每天要吃超过500磅重的食物吗
Over 500 pounds of food per day?!

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,880
它们的粪便
