00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,870
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,050
你得了下丘脑错构瘤
You have hypothalamus Hamartoma,

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,790
医生认为你需要手术
the doctor feels you need surgery

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,130
否则  你会死
Otherwise you could die

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,680
你不听命令吗
You are not following direct orders?

7
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,000
我听命令  长官
Oh, I'm following direct orders, sir.

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,100
只不过不听你的了
Just not from you anymore.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,240
如果不是你  我就死在这张桌子上了
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, Doc.

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,000
干嘛
What?

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,600
该回家了
Time to come home now.

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,570
你要帮我找一个新的买家
You're going to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.

13
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,100
他叫怀肯  他不是买家  是个中间人
His name is Vikan, and he's not a buyer, he's a conduit.

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,640
我们走吧
Let's go.

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,740
巴格维尔留在这里
And Bagwell's staying here.

16
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,500
我警告过你别耍我
I warned you not to screw me over.

17
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,870
别来无恙  格雷琴  他是谁
It's been a long time, Gretchen. Who's he?

18
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,370
"锡拉"在我手上
I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.

19
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,870
这是不完整的  少了一个部件  小子
It's incomplete. There's a piece missing, slick.

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
你好啊  唐
Hello, Don.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,670
我相信你拿了我的东西
I believe you have something that belongs to me.

22
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,940
过来拿吧
Come and get it.

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,540
你应该知道  这不是什么灵丹妙药
Just so it's fresh in your mind, this isn't a magic elixir.

24
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,800
你还是要去医院
You still need a hospital.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,170
你需要真正的仪器
You need real equipment.

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,200
或者找一个
Could probably use a doctor

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,840
有医疗执照的医生
who's still got a license to practice medicine.

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,840
首先  我们要找回"锡拉"
First we get Scylla.

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,070
然后  我才去医院
Then I'll go to the hospital.

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
你弄完了吗
You finished?

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,700
差不多了
Just about.

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,370
你现在准备说话了
So, I take it you're ready to talk now?

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,770
事实上  我准备好和你见面了
Actually, I'm ready to meet.

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,840
我有一个更好的主意
I got a better idea.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,670
所有人都出去
Everyone out!

36
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,770
你被包围了
You're surrounded.

37
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,270
把"锡拉"部件交出来  迈克尔
Come out with your piece of Scylla, Michael.

38
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,540
你先交
You first.

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
出来吧  不然  我就用烟把你们熏出来
Come out, or I'm going to gas you out.

40
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,770
如果你们被熏出来  我有满满的一梭子子弹
If it's the latter, I have a full magazine with 30 rounds.

41
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,300
想赌一把  看是不是有人跑得比你快
Want to bet at least one of them could outrun you?

42
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,140
你凭什么认为  我把部件带在身上
What makes you think I'd even keep the piece on me?

43
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,340
我了解你  迈克尔
Oh, I know you, Michael.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,070
你随身带着那块东西
You're not letting that thing out of your sight.

45
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,000
我还是那句话
I stand by my original offer.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,100
过来拿吧
Come and get it.

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,570
好吧
Okay.

48
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,440
趴低点  等烟升到天花板
Stay low. Let the gas rise to the ceiling.

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,670
这里空间很大  但是  在我们窒息前
This is a big space, but it won't take many more of those

50
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,100
撑不了多久
before we start to asphyxiate.

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,600
林肯在哪
Where's Lincoln?!

52
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,070
还多着呢  迈克尔
Here we go, Michael.

53
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,470
好了  我们现在开车去拿"锡拉"
All right, now we take a ride and we pick up Scylla.

54
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,800
不然  我就一枪崩了你
Or I put a bullet in your head.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,170
不可能
It ain't gonna happen.

56
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,600
试试看
Try me.

57
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,800
大家早
Good morning.

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,240
现在  大家都被枪指着
Okay, all right, now that we all have guns pointed at us,

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,300
我们谈谈吧  好吗
let's talk, okay?

60
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,670
说吧
Fine.

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,700
你先告诉我  我到底是在和谁说话  是唐吗
You could start by telling me who I'm talking to, Don?

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,270
我在过去17年里
You're talking to a guy who spent 17 years

63
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,070
规规矩矩为政府卖命
in service of his government, all by the book.

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,140
你知道  这些值多少钱吗
You know what the sum total of it was?

65
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,870
一文不值  什么都不是
Nothing. Nada.

66
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,370
我们是一类人  迈克尔
But we're very similar, Michael,

67
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,700
而且  从根本来说  我们要的是同一样东西
and fundamentally, we want the same thing.

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,370
我有方法拿到手
And I have a way to get it.

69
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,770
什么意思
How's that?

70
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,170
我找了一个"锡拉"买家
I got a buyer for Scylla.

71
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,870
一个和你一样  想搞垮"公司"的人
A guy who wants to destroy the Company as much as you do.

72
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,970
他愿意付一大笔钱
And he's willing to pay a lot of money for it.

73
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,540
多少钱
How much?

74
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,140
你选一个国外帐号  九位数
Nine figures in an offshore account of your choosing.

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,900
就是这样
So, there it is.

76
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,370
或者
Or...

77
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,370
你可以继续按你的原则办事
you could stand by your principles.

78
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,900
我不干
I'll pass.

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,070
我是骗了你  我承认
Look, I burned you, right?

80
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,070
我道歉  但是  有意义吗
And I'd apologize, but what's the point?

81
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,240
我们的处境都很尴尬
We're all out in the cold now.

82
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,270
但是  我们不可能一直躲着"公司"
But we're not going to be able to hide from the Company

83
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,370
我们根本没有本钱
on a shoestring budget.

84
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,570
谁是买家
Who's the buyer?

85
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,270
他以前在"公司"做事  有过节
He's an ex-Company guy with a bone to pick.

86
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,800
和你爸一样
Just like your father.

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,900
迈克尔
Michael?

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,370
我要先和他见面
I'd need to meet him first.

89
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,700
可以安排
That can be arranged.

90
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,570
只是想告诉你
And just so you know, this...

91
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,740
这不是私人恩怨  只是笔交易
This wasn't personal. This is just business.

92
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,540
我会和你联络的
We'll be in touch.

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,770
我们还是按原计划行事
We stick to the plan, all right?

94
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,270
我们会拿回"锡拉"
We're going to get Scylla.

95
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,270
只要等阿历克斯那头打通关系
We wait for Alex to come through on his end.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,070
好吗
All right?

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
你好  阿历克斯
Hello, Alex.

98
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,170
你来了
You came.

99
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,340
我一向遵守承诺
I always do,

100
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,040
就算会被扣工钱
to the detriment of my pay grade.

101
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,370
过去几个星期
These last few weeks,

102
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,970
我参与了一起秘密行动
I've been part of an off-the-books operation

103
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,940
是国安局安排的
under the hand of Homeland Security.

104
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,200
费丽舍  和我共事的人
Felicia, the people I'm working with,

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,770
我们就差那么一点
we're this close to coming up with

106
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,440
就能得到摧毁"公司"的东西
the one thing that can destroy the Company:

107
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,140
他们的黑皮书  我们能搞到手  里面有姓名  数字
their little black book. We can get it. Names, numbers.

108
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,470
我可不想夹在部门间的斗争里
Look, I don't want to get caught up in some interagency politics.

109
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,940
如果这次国安局的行动
So, if this is Homeland's show...

110
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,870
国安局终止了行动  我们不能再回去了
Homeland buried the operation. We can't come back in.

111
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,840
但是  我们还可以搞垮"公司"
But we could still take the Company down.

112
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,870
所以  我的问题是
So, my question to you is:

113
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,200
在联调局里  你认为可以信任谁
Who do you know in the Bureau that you can trust?

114
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,140
以前是你  阿历克斯
It used to be you, Alex.

115
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,170
过去几个月  我失去了很多东西
I've lost a lot of things these last few months,

116
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,340
不止是你的信任
not the least of which is your trust.

117
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,340
但我不是来乞求你的
But I don't come to you hat in hand.

118
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,400
"锡拉"是存在的
Scylla is real.

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,870
如果你不想扯上关系  我可以理解
But if you don't want anything to do with it, it's okay.

120
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,770
没事  我可以离开
It's all right; I could walk away.

121
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,900
有一个人也许能帮你
Yeah, there is someone who might be able to help.

122
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,940
长官  洛杉矶有超过1千万人口
Sir, there are over ten million faces in Los Angeles.

123
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,670
加上安全局和情报局的卫星  我们需要过滤
Even with NSA and CIA satellite links, we're going to be sifting

124
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,870
几百万G的图像数据
through millions of gigabytes of image data.

125
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,670
找到唐・赛尔夫
The chances of finding Don Self,

126
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,670
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯的几率  不是很高
Scofield and Burrows... it's not good.

127
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,000
让我们增加几率
Well, let's improve the odds.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,540
赛尔夫和兄弟俩
Self and the brothers

129
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,540
是偷了"锡拉"  但是
may have stolen Scylla but none of them have

130
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,200
他们没有任何办法出售
the connections to off-load it.

131
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,440
在查找中加上格雷琴的脸
Add Gretchen's face to the search.

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,140
她不可能是斯科菲尔德小组的一员
She won't be welcome in Scofield's camp.

133
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,370
把她和赛尔夫的图像联系到一起
So, connect her image with Self's.

134
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,940
如果在洛杉矶任何5尺距离内
We find those two within five feet of each other

135
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,640
找到他们  我们就能找到"锡拉"
anywhere in Los Angeles, and we've found Scylla.

136
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,870
你是格雷琴阿姨的朋友吗
Are you friends with my Auntie Gretchen?

137
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,640
去你的房间玩  妈妈一会就过去
Go play in your room. Mommy will be in soon.

138
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,300
她爸爸在哪
Where's her daddy?

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,570
格雷琴从来不提及他
Gretchen doesn't talk about him.

140
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,800
艾米丽还不知道你不是她的
So, Emily doesn't know that you ain't...

141
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,470
格雷琴是她妈妈
That Gretchen's her mama?

142
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,000
不  我宁愿保持这种方式
No, and I'd like to keep it that way.

143
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,670
可爱的孩子
Cute girl.

144
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,700
不要伤害我的孩子
Don't hurt my little girl.

145
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,370
如果你要做什么  冲我来吧
If you have to do something, do it to me.

146
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,900
你以为我是什么人
What do you think I am?

147
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,770
野兽
A monster?

148
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,570
你把我们囚禁在我们家里
You're holding us prisoner in our own home.

149
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,270
我和你们一样  都是囚犯
I'm just as much a prisoner as you.

150
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,200
奶白色  黑体字
Eggshell white. Bold lettering.

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,570
双层浮花  我曾经是科尔・普发
Double embossed. I was Cole Pfeiffer.

152
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,200
受人尊敬的商人
Respected businessman.

153
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,400
东北区域最好的推销员
Top salesman in the Northeast Region.

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,340
现在  我又变回过去的
Now I'm back being prisoner

155
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,000
囚犯身份
of my own identity.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,040
帝博格・巴格维尔  罪犯
Theodore Bagwell. Convict.

157
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,570
管他呢  江山易改  本性难移  对吧
To hell with it. We are who we are, right?

158
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,170
你是卖什么的
What were you selling?

159
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,500
你管不着
Never you mind.

160
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,100
你只要祈祷你妹妹能脱险
You just pray your sister comes through.

161
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,170
"公司"被搞垮  我们拿到钱
The Company gets destroyed  and we get paid.

162
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,740
这买卖其实不错
It's a great deal.

163
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,000
这个人只会是另一个克兰兹将军
This guy is just another General Krantz waiting to happen.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,140
假设我们把"锡拉"买给他  这个"公司"倒了
Let's say we do sell it to him and the Company burns,

165
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,540
你知道接下来会怎样吗
You know what happens then?

166
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,240
另一个"公司"会在前者之上建立
Another company is built right on top of that one.

167
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,740
我们不卖
We're not selling.

168
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,740
我进去了
I'm in.

169
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,240
苏克雷搞定了
Sucre pulled it off.

170
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,170
好极了
Great.

171
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,620
找出地点
Get an address.

172
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,140
有用吗
Is this going to work?

173
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,240
这就象超声波
It's like an ultrasound.

174
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,470
能透视所有东西
It can see through everything.

175
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,260
你这是增大耐药量
You're building up a tolerance.

176
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,000
那就加大剂量
Then we'll up the dosage.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,730
对  我增加了
Yeah, I have,

178
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,060
但这样的话  大剂量会比肿瘤本身
and at this point, a higher dosage would have

179
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,560
带来更多的副作用
more side effects than the tumor itself.

180
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,600
我会尽量不用它
I'll manage without it.

181
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,960
你坐在这等着
Sit this one out.

182
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,500
让我和苏克雷来处理
Let me and Sucre handle it.

183
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,860
我也去
I'm going.

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,660
他怎么就不理解  我要结束这一切
Why can't he understand I need to finish this?

185
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,300
所发生的一切
Everything that happened,

186
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,630
都是"公司"引起的
it all started with the Company.

187
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,000
也许林肯不这么认为
Maybe not for Lincoln.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
也许对他来说  这一切
Maybe for him, this all started

189
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,000
是从他弟弟救他越狱开始的
with his little brother breaking him out of prison.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,360
迈克尔  你救了他的命
Michael, you saved his life.

191
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,030
如果你有什么不测
If anything happens to you,

192
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,700
他下辈子都会愧疚
he spends the rest of his life feeling guilty for that.

193
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
告诉我
Tell me something,

194
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,260
什么时候一件高尚的事变成了狂热盲从
at what point does a noble deed become fanaticism?

195
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,260
狂热是打败他们的唯一方法
Fanaticism is the only way to beat them.

196
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,060
即使为此丧命吗
Even if it kills you?

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,400
打开车尾箱
Hey, pop the trunk.

198
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,050
方特罗伊旅店停车场
Fauntleroy Hotel Parking only.

199
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
迈克尔
Micheal?

200
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,360
苏克雷刚发了条信息  他发现格雷琴和赛尔夫了
Sucre just sent a text. He's found Gretchen and Self.

201
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,830
很好  很好
Good, good.

202
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,560
你没事吧
You all right?

203
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,060
目前还好
Yeah, for now.

204
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,730
好的
All right.

205
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,100
-林肯  -什么
-Linc?  -Yeah?

206
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,660
当天审判过后  我去福克斯河监狱看你
After your trial that day I came to see you at Fox River...

207
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,860
怎么了
What about it?

208
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,300
我认为是你干的
I thought you did it.

209
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,430
我认为是你杀了特伦斯・斯特曼
I thought you killed Terrence Steadman.

210
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,760
其他人也这么想吗
Along with everyone else?

211
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,560
但我离开的时候
But by the time I left, I...

212
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,300
我知道你是无辜的
I knew you were innocent.

213
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,230
我一定要把你从里面弄出来
And I had to get you out of that place.

214
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,100
不管这次结果怎样
So, however this plays out,

215
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,300
我决不后悔
I have no regrets.

216
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,330
斯科菲尔德在厕所藏了东西
Scofield's hiding something in the washroom.

217
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,360
看来我们找到了
I think we just found

218
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
缺失的"锡拉"部件了  给怀肯打电话
our missing piece of Scylla. Call Vikan.

219
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
我要先跟我女儿通话
I want to talk to my daughter first.

220
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,830
只管给怀肯打电话  她们没事
Just call him, okay, they're fine.

221
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,100
我跟怀肯有过交易
I have a history with Vikan.

222
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,860
如果我不告诉他你没问题  他是不会交易的
No money exchanges hands unless I tell him you're legit.

223
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,230
我要跟我女儿通话  马上
I want to talk to my daughter. Now!

224
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,100
喂
Yeah?

225
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,660
让她女儿听电话
Put the daughter on the phone.

226
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,100

Is there a problem?

227
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,900
只管让她听电话
Just put her on the phone.

228
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,730
喂
Hello?

229
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,130
艾米丽  宝贝  我是格雷琴阿姨
Emily, baby, it's your Auntie Gretchen.

230
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,260
你在哪
Where are you?

231
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,360
不远的地方  你还好吗
I'm not far. Are you okay?

232
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,400
这里有个坏人
There's this mean man here.

233
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,960
艾米丽  宝贝  还记得
Emily, baby, do you remember the mean man

234
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,700
以前跟你妈妈丽塔一起住的坏人吗
that used to live with your mommy Rita?

235
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,060
那个对你大吼大叫的人
The one that used to yell at you all the time?

236
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
罗伊吗
Roy?

237
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,530
就是他
That's the one.

238
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,130
罗伊最后怎么了
And what happened to Roy?

239
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,560
有一天  他去商店
He went to the store one day

240
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,030
就再没回来了
and never came back.

241
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,660
没错
That's right.

242
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,730
我觉得  如果你不喜欢这个坏人
And I think that if you don't like this mean man,

243
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,800
很快  他就会走
then very soon, he's going to leave

244
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,060
永远不会再回来
and he's never coming back.

245
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,000
真的吗
You think so?

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,860
宝贝  是真的
Baby, I know so.

247
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,200
行了  够了
All right, that's enough.

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,430
艾米丽  宝贝  让那个坏人接电话
Emily, baby, put the mean man back on the phone.

249
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
听着  我两小时内给你打电话
Listen to me. I'm going to call you

250
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,760
告诉你准确的交易地址
in two hours with the exact location of the exchange.

251
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,930
如果我没打电话
If you don't hear from me,

252
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,430
就把她们杀了
kill them both.

253
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,430
你有客人吗
You expecting somebody?

254
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,900
没有
No.

255
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,800
自然点
Look lively.

256
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,630
宝贝
Hey, buttercup, why don't you

257
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,230
去房间玩吧
go play with your dollsies or something.

258
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,330
没事的  宝贝  回房间玩吧
It's okay, honey. Go to your playroom.

259
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,100
你们好
Hi, there.

260
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,460
我叫拉尔夫・贝克  我是卖圣经的
My name is Ralph Becker, and I'm selling Bibles

261
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,630
为圣三一教会筹集善款
to raise money for the Church of the Holy Trinity.

262
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,000
不知你们能否花5分钟
And I wonder if I could spend five minutes

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,130
我们谈谈福音
of your time and talk about the Gospel with you.

264
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,360
拉尔夫  我们现在有点  不太方便
We're a bit, uh, indisposed at the moment, Ralph.

265
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,760
明天再来吧
Can you come back tomorrow?

266
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,330
今天是筹款的最后一天
Well, actually, today is the last day of the fund-raiser.

267
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,930
我说我们很忙
I said we're busy.

268
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,430
但总能为上帝抽出点时间吧
We're never too busy for God.

269
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,400
在他的王国里
And what's a few minutes

270
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,500
在下午抽出点时间  怎么样
of your afternoon for a place in His kingdom?

271
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,830
朋友  你这圣经推销员可有点强求
You're a bit pushy for a Bible salesman, ain't you, friend?

272
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,880
我有使命在身
I'm on a mission.

273
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,560
你有使命在身  对吧
You're on a mission, right?

274
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,100
-你在做什么  -关门
-What are you doing?!  -Close the door!

275
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,030
-他是"公司"的人  -什么"公司"
-This guy is Company!  -What company?!

276
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,860
拿绳子把他捆起来
Get me some rope to tie him up with.

277
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,600
他只是个圣经推销员
This guy is a Bible salesman.

278
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,730
去拿绳子  现在就去
Get me the rope, now!

279
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,400
阿历克斯  很会选见面地点嘛
Good choice for a meeting spot, Alex.

280
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
人多  两个出口
Crowded place. Two exits.

281
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,230
墙角的座位  整个房间的动静尽收眼底
Corner table with a full view of the room.

282
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,800
看来你习惯逃亡的生活了
Looks like you're getting acclimated to life on the run.

283
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,330
听说你升职了
I hear you got promoted.

284
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,130
有自己的办公室  惠勒
Your own field office, Wheeler.

285
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,630
真是让人印象深刻
That's impressive.

286
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,000
如果你不是丢了联调局的脸
When you're neither a disgrace to the Bureau

287
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,130
或者犯毒瘾  你也能摊上这样的好事
nor a drug addict, good things can happen.

288
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,160
他都戒掉了  马克
He's clean, Mark.

289
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,630
谢谢提醒   费丽舍
Thank you, Felicia.

290
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,700
我知道你为人  马克
Look, I know you, Mark.

291
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,000
你是一名好特工  有雄心壮志
You're a good agent, ambitious.

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
让我助你一臂之力
So, let me appeal to the side of you

293
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,900
让你的名字上头条
that likes to see your name in print.

294
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,000
想进副局长候选人名单吧
Want to be on a short list for Deputy Director? Huh?

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,530
没错  朗格把我加进去了
Right. Lang filled me in.

296
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,160
你原本已十拿九稳
You've got solid gold intel.

297
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,230
我不知道我是否比一个被炒的联调员
I don't know if I'm more skeptical of a burned out ex-Fed

298
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,200
或一个被称为"公司"的神秘组织让人怀疑
or the mythical cabal known as the Company.

299
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,830
你大老远来就为了个秘密
You came all the way here for a myth?

300
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,760
你想怎样  阿历克斯
What do you want, Alex?

301
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,360
费丽舍跟我说你是司法部长的耳目
Felicia tells me you have the attorney general's ear.

302
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,560
没错
That's right.

303
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,730
联调局在密谋交易

518
