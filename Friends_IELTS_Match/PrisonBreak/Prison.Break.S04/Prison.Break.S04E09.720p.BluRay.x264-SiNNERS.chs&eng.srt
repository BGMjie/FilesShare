2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,030
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
你要"锡拉"做什么
What do you want with Scylla?

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,030
和你一样  打垮"公司"
Same thing you want: bring down the Company.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,260
我们需要那几页
We need the pages.

6
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,430
我们一起合作吗
Are we partners?

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,530
是的
Partners.

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,400
你哥哥跟我说了你流鼻血的事
So your brother told me about your nosebleeds.

9
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,860
我很好
I'm fine.

10
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,100
你看起来可不好
You don't look fine.

11
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,030
对不起
Sorry.

12
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,130
引以为戒吧
Consider this a warning.

13
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,300
林肯  倒回去
Linc, pull back!

14
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,300
是个圈套
It's a trap!

15
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,630
快走  林肯
Come on, Linc!

16
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,600
等一下
Hang on!

17
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,960
你没事吧  你中枪了
You all right?! Damn, you're hit!

18
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,400
好了  好了
All right, all right.

19
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,330
你会有机会收拾他的  退后
You'll get your shot, now back off!

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,060
他们是想拿我的卡
This is an attempt on my card.

21
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,200
接下来你想怎么办
How do you want to proceed?

22
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,260
我要转移它
I want it moved.

23
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,030
转移"锡拉"
Move Scylla.

24
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,460
现在
Now!

25
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,060
告诉将军你把我们都干掉了
Now, tell the General you killed us.

26
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,900
否则  我的手可不会歇着
Otherwise, my hand, it ain't going to get tired.

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,630
我觉得你的嘴该歇歇了
I just hope your mouth gets tired.

28
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,660
很搞笑
That's funny.

29
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,600
走吧  老兄  走吧
Come on, buddy, come on.

30
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,630
够了  我们走吧  林肯
Enough already, come on, Linc.

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,130
现在相信我了吧
Believe me now?

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
打他是没有用的  林肯
Beating him isn't going to work, Lincoln.

33
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,400
你的方法也用过了
You tried your way.

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,030
我们要让克兰兹将军相信怀特已经把我们解决了
We want General Krantz to think Wyatt took us out.

35
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,200
就算你把他打到给将军打电话
Even if you do beat him to make the call to general.

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,760
你觉得一个训练有素的军人
you don't think a trained military veteran

37
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,460
听不出他话里的恐惧吗
is going to hear the fear in his voice?

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,700
他们会知道他是被强迫的
They're going to know he was coerced.

39
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,000
对付他要多点时间
Yeah,well.I need some more time with him.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,860
我明白  林肯  但是他神志不清的话也不能打电话
I hear you, Linc, but he can't make the call if he's unconscious.

41
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,660
不管我们怎么做
However we do it,

42
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,800
我们最好快点从怀特那里得到我们想要的
we better get what we need from Wyatt soon,

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,700
马宏可等不及了
because Mahone ain't going to wait.

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,060
我要找到那个杀我儿子的贱人
I'm trying to find the son of a bitch who killed my kid!

45
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,830
丽莎  情况如何
Lisa, what are we looking at?

46
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,030
初步估计转移"锡拉"大概要三天
Initial estimate is three days to complete the move of Scylla.

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,900
我不能接受
Unacceptable.

48
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,700
请听我说  这可不像把一台电脑
Respectfully, this is not as simple as unplugging

49
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,000
从一间房挪到另一间房那么简单
a laptop and moving it to another room.

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,400
"锡拉"里的数据太复杂了
The data on Scylla is too delicate.

51
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,200
我不想听理由
I don't want excuses.

52
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,400
我只关心  它能否妥善转移以及是否现在就转移
All I care is that it's done right and done right now.

53
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,200
我明白这很紧急  但也要三天时间
I understand the urgency, but it will take three days.

54
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,360
请允许我说几句  我觉得
And if I may speak freely, I think it's a mistake

55
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,360
把"锡拉"转移到拉文罗克地堡
to move Scylla to the Raven Rock bunker

56
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,800
而放弃对我们来说最安全的洛城
when the Los Angeles facility

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,400
是一个错误
is one of the most secure ones we have.

58
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,400
对我们来说最安全的地方
The most secure location we have

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,060
就是不为人知的地方
is the one they don't know about.

60
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,930
长官
Sir...

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
还是没有怀特的消息
Still no word from Wyatt.

62
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,230
他只用"公司"提供的电话
He only uses the company-issued cell,

63
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,530
我们追踪不到他
so we can't track him.

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
我们无法确定
We have no way of confirming

65
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,900
他是否完成了任务
if he successfully completed his operation.

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
继续联系
Keep calling him!

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,000
准备一份新闻稿
And draft a press release,

68
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,500
照片  犯罪记录
photographs, criminal records,

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,860
所有关于斯科菲尔德  布伦斯等人的全部资料
everything we have on Scofield, Burrows, all of them.

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,660
告诉媒体的朋友  我要他们
Tell our friends in the media I want them

71
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,200
在晚间新闻和早报里都报导
to saturate the evening news and the morning papers.

72
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,900
我要让他们不能
I want it impossible for them

73
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,760
大摇大摆的走在洛城的街道上
to walk down the streets of Los Angeles without being spotted.

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
我猜我们还没在他身上
I assume we haven't made much progress

75
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,260
得到任何进展
with our friend over there?

76
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,130
有什么建议吗
Any suggestions?

77
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,260
要不我们和他谈谈
How about we talk to him?

78
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,430
好啊  要不要给他点牛奶和饼干
Great, want to give him some milk and cookies while you're at it?

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,760
不是
No.

80
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,460
随便聊聊怎么样
How about just some nice conversation?

81
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,600
他们就叫个护士
So they sent Florence Nightingale

82
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,100
来让我乖乖合作
to get me all ready to cooperate.

83
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,800
实际上   不管你做了什么  我是来帮你的
Actually, I'm here to help you, despite what you've done.

84
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,700
因为我还是医生  而你是囚犯
Because I'm still a doctor and you're a prisoner.

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,460
你想要救我
You're going to save me?

86
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,260
唐・赛尔夫带了个箱子来
Don Self has a metal case out there

87
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,760
我不知道里面有什么
and I don't know what's in it.

88
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,300
我猜你也不会想知道
I imagine you don't want to find out,

89
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,630
所以  我想我们要是谈谈
so I figure if you and I had a talk...

90
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,160
你会给我一线生机
You'd make me see the light.

91
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,530
你要是不给将军打电话  你就死定了
If you don't call the General, you're as good as dead.

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,590
我早经历过很多生不如死的事  医生
I've already been a lot of things worse than dead in my life, Doctor.

93
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,660
你还是找个好点的理由来威胁我
You better have more than that to threaten me with.

94
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,430
放心  迈克尔  她没事的
Come on, Mike, she's okay.

95
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,060
他是个职业杀手
He's a professional killer.

96
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,460
不用担心  他已经被拷起来了
Don't worry, he's locked up.

97
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,700
我们走吧
Let's go.

98
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,200
快点  我们走吧
Come on, let's go!

99
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,600
你想怎么处理罗兰的尸体
So what'd you do with Roland's body?

100
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,800
罗兰
Roland?

101
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,060
他的资料已经全改了
He's been, uh, reconfigured

102
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,900
而且埋在一个长眠之地
and given a permanent resting place.

103
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,160
太好了  你走的时候顺便
Good. Take his bowling shirts

104
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,830
把他的衣物和他的垃圾也带走
and the rest of his crap with you when you leave.

105
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,200
算了吧  林肯  人都死了
Come on Linc, the guy died.

106
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,560
他出卖了我们  死有余辜  贝里克
He died a punk! He ratted us out, Bellick.

107
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,530
各位  我们先处理眼前的事
You guys, you deal with the matter at hand.

108
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,460
假设这几张纸是正确的
Assuming these pages are correct,

109
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,400
我们也无从考证它们是不是真的
and there's no way of knowing that they actually are...

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,230
我们从地下走廊  通过锅炉房到这
we follow this basement hallway through the boiler room to here.

111
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,200
这里是往上走的爬梯
There's some kind of elevated walkway.

112
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,500
我们顺着走到底
We follow that to the end,

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
这样我们就涵盖了大部分
and we've covered most of the distance

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,360
从伽特到"公司"总部间的距离
between GATE and the Company's headquarters.

115
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,430
走廊尽头的是什么东西
What's this thing at the end of the walkway?

116
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
我也不知道  惠斯勒用X做了个标记
I don't know-- Whistler marked it with an "X"

117
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,500
我想可能是面墙或大的障碍物
so I'm thinking it's some kind of wall or serious impediment.

118
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,330
所以我们要下去做好准备
That's why we're going down there prepared.

119
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,160
工具  电焊  锤子
Tools, thermal lances, sledgehammers...

120
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,600
就算我们穿过了墙
Okay, so we get through that wall...

121
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,760
另一边是什么
what's on the other side?

122
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,600
我还不知道
Again, I don't know.

123
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,600
因为剩下的几页在格雷琴手里
It's because Gretchen has the rest of the pages.

124
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,260
但是一旦我们通过这个地方
But once we're through this location,

125
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,260
除非她把几页纸给我们  否则就无法前进
we can't go any further until she gives them back.

126
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,500
她到底耍什么诡计
What's her game in all this?

127
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,600
如果她想把"公司"搞垮
I mean, if she wants the Company to go down,

128
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,130
她就应该把几页纸给我们
she should just give us the pages.

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,500
只要时机成熟
Look, we're going to deal with Gretchen

130
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,930
我们就解决格雷琴
when the time is right, okay?

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,530
你们要
You guys need

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,660
去伽特开始准备
to go to GATE and get started.

133
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,700
我留下来看着怀特
I'm going to stay here with Wyatt

134
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,800
确保从他嘴里套有用的东西
and make sure we get what we need.

135
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,500
从现在开始不能乱串
No more dawdlin' now.

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,900
走快点
Move your ass.

137
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,160
快点  先生们  快点
High gear, gentlemen, high gear.

138
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,800
我老板随时可能会来
My boss will be here any minute.

139
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,830
我想我不用重申谨慎行事至关重要
I assume I don't have to mention that discretion is paramount.

140
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,560
换句话说  "沉默"是金
In other words, silence is golden.

141
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,260
你只要确保在办公室里呆着
You just make sure you stay in your office

142
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,900
别让别人进来
and you keep other people out.

143
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,300
我会呆在舒适
Oh, I'll stay in my nice,

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
凉快的办公室里的  小白脸
air-conditioned office, Pretty.

145
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,700
你现在可以爬你的小洞里去了
And you can crawl down into your little hole now.

146
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,600
快
Go ahead.

147
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,430
快
Go ahead.

148
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,360
快  爬吧
Go ahead, crawl.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,560
科尔  这里到底出什么事了
Cole? What the hell is going on here?

150
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,660
怀特先生  你回来了
Mr. White, are you back already?

151
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,830
你好吗
How are you?

152
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,500
很好  直到我收到一封安德鲁・布劳努
Fine, until I found a resignation fax

153
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,030
发来的辞职传真
waiting for me from Andrew Blauner.

154
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,000
辞职信
A resignation?

155
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,530
对  打电话也不接
Yeah, I can't get him on the phone,

156
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
我打给他未婚妻
I reached out to his fiancee,

157
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,400
她也不知道没有他的消息
she hasn't seen or heard from him.

158
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,200
她非常担心
She's worried sick.

159
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,400
他可能就是喝大了
He's probably on a bit of a bender,

160
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,660
睡在什么地方了
just sleeping it off somewhere.

161
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,530
布劳努可是名童子军
Blauner? He's a Boy Scout.

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,430
这不合逻辑  科尔
None of this makes any sense, Cole.

163
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
不过我告诉你
But I'll tell you what,

164
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,330
我会查清楚的
I'm going to look into it.

165
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,260
有需要我帮忙的地方  就告诉我
Let me know if I can be of any assistance.

166
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,930
早上好
Good morning.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,660
帮忙
Assistance...

168
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,060
那是什么声音
What is that sound?

169
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,230
喂
Yeah?

170
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,230
我希望能有个愉快的早晨
I hope you're having a lovely enjoyable morning,

171
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,560
因为你不在的时候
because while you are nowhere to be found,

172
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,930
这边已经在调查
there is sleuthing going on here

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,100
安德鲁・布劳努的下落了
regarding the whereabouts of one Mr. Andrew Blauner.

174
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,960
还有吗
And?

175
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,660
如果我卷进这起凶杀案的话
And if I'm going down for this little homicide,

176
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,000
我可不会一个人背黑锅
I ain't going alone.

177
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,660
我们肯定是形影不离的
We're going together like traffic and weather.

178
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,930
放松点  好吗
Relax, okay?

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,460
他们绝对找不到我放尸体的地方
They'll never find the body where I put it.

180
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,830
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯现在在哪
Now, where are Scofield and Burrows?

181
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,660
正在履行他们的承诺
Just doing their end of the bargain.

182
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,200
顺便问一下  你到底在干嘛
Which begs the question, what the hell are you doing?

183
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,260
我
Me?

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,960
我准备去会一个人
I'm getting ready for a meeting.

185
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,100
你朋友一直打电话给你
So, your friends have been calling a lot.

186
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,200
他们一定在想你到哪儿去了
They must be wondering where you are.

187
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,430
没错
That's right.

188
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,330
他们在怀疑  而他们怀疑得越久
They're wondering, and the longer they do,

189
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,930
你们就越危险
the more danger you're in.

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,530
打电话给将军  照他们的话说
Call the General, and say what they want you to say.

191
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
然后呢  你们会放我走吗
And what? You'll let me go?

192
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,760
不会  但唐・赛尔夫能确保
No, but Don Self will make sure

193
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,000
你免于死刑
that you spend the rest of your life

194
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,200
下半辈子悠闲自在
in a decent facility without the death penalty.

195
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,630
无论如何
Either way,

196
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,960
无论我打不打这通电话
if I make the call or not,

197
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,030
我都会死
I'm dead.

198
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
你心里明白的很
You know that.

199
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,700
我们都清楚  你作为一名医生
And we both know that you, as a doctor,

200
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,730
不会容许这种事情发生
won't let that happen.

201
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,760
所以  不如
So, please,

202
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,830
我们一起想个
let's you and I figure a way

203
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,000
互惠互利的解决办法
out of this mess that works for everybody.

204
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,660
-坐好  -别挡路
Sit your ass down! Get out of my way!

205
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,960
别 别这样
Out! Out!

206
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,300
不然我会把你按在桌子上的
I will cuff your ass to that table, okay?

207
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,960
我知道这很痛苦
All right, I know this is hard.

208
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,930
我也知道你想干什么
And I know what you want to do.

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,800
可是我们正在努力做事
Okay, but I'm trying to do something here

210
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,530
你必须接受现实
and you need to deal with that reality.

211
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,260
你有失去孩子吗
Have you lost a kid?

212
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,330
我失去过
Yeah, I did, too.

213
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,700
我老婆当时怀孕
My wife was pregnant.

214
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,830
她有并发症  而那个庸医不会处理
And there were complications and the doctor messed up.

215
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,330
而她
And she...

216
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,360
他们都
And they both...

217
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,830
他们都死了
They didn't make it.

218
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,600
行了吧  我感同身受
Okay? So I understand.

219
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,500
如果你是我  你会怎么做
What would you do if you were me

220
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,530
如果坐在那里的就是那个庸医
and that doctor was right there?

221
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,530
你会怎样
What would you do?

222
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,630
我也不知道我会怎样
I don't know what I would do.

223
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,960
听着  我向你保证
Look, I'm giving you my word.

224
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,900
一旦时机成熟  我绝对不会阻拦你
When the time is right, I won't stand in your way.

225
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,300
到时候你也拦不住我
When the time is right I won't let you.

226
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,960
行  行
Okay. Okay.

227
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,860
你们看到马宏看怀特的样子吗
Did you see the way  Mahone was looking at Wyatt?

228
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,760
那家伙很伤心
The guy is hurting.

229
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,260
不是伤心那么简单  简直就是煎熬
It was more than just hurting, that's pain.

230
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,300
我从来没有那么在意一件事
I never cared about anything like that.

231
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,200
看看我这辈子
I look at what I've done with my life,

232
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,860
在福克斯河监狱作威作福  捞钱
beating on cons at Fox River, chasing money,

233
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,200
努力离开监狱
trying to keep my own ass out of prison.

234
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,030
这就是你说的那条小路吗
This the pathway you talking about?

235
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,360
根据地图
According to the map,

236
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,360
这条路几乎有整个中庭那么长
this runs almost the length of that courtyard.

237
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,660
它应该直接通向"公司"总部的下方
It should put us directly beneath Company headquarters.

238
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,930
嘘  听
Shh, listen.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
又是这种声音
There it is again.

240
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,430
那是什么声音  斯科菲尔德
What's that noise, Scofield?

241
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,560
不知道
I don't know.

242
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,000
那么我们都清楚  我们要爬上楼梯
Okay, just so we're clear, we get to go up that ladder

243
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,930
去往那个不明声音的来源地
towards the noise that we don't know what it is.

244
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,200
如果走运的话  我们就基本能
But if we're lucky, we get to basically just

245
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,900
潜进"公司"
walk smack into the Company?

246
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,060
没错
Sounds about right.

247
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,200
你要上去吗
You up for it?

248
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,600
当然  紧随你后
Oh, yeah, after you.

249
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,630
我跟坐在那边的
I am no different than that man

250
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,060
那个想杀我的人没什么不同
over there... who wants to kill me.

251
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,400
亚历山大・马宏是被迫为"公司"卖命
Alexander Mahone was forced to do things by the Company,

252
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,960
我也一样
and so was I.

253
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,360
但我认识一些人
But I know people.

254
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,530
在政府做事的人
People in government.

255
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,530
他们能帮你和迈克尔
People that can help you and Michael.

256
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,130
我可以给你一个电话号码
I can give you a phone number.

257
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,560
可以安排一下
Arrangements can be made.

258
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,200
你只要相信我
All you have to do is trust me

259
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,500
一切都可以结束
and this will all be over.

260
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,160
已经结束了
It is over.

261
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,200
怀特有布劳努的新消息吗
Has, um, White had anything new to say about Blauner?

262
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,800
没有  但他可能会有
No, but he might.

263
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,430
普发先生
Mr. Pfeiffer?

264
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,530
正是本人
That would be moi.

265
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,960
康纳・莫拉侦探
Detective Conor Mara.

266
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,260
我想跟你谈谈安德鲁・布劳努的事
I was hoping I could talk to you about Andrew Blauner.

267
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,960
当然可以
Of course.

268
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,230
太好了
Great.

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,030
从这下去
It's down this way.

270
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,760
找到了
This is it!

271
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,330
这就是那种声音的来源
This is where the sound was coming from.

272
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,530
洛城其中一条供水的主水管
One of the main conduit pipes for the LA water supply.

273
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,060
每秒3万加仑的水
30,000 gallons of water rushing through this very spot.

274
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,530
-流经这里  -那完了
Every second. Oh, great.

275
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,760
有其他路可以绕过这家伙吗
There's got to be some other way to get around it,

276
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,830
其他通道什么的
some other pathway or something.

277
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,660
没有  我们从唯一一条通道下来
No, we took the only pathway down

278
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,960
直接来到这里
and it leads right here.

279
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,730
从上面越过怎么样
How about over it?

280
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,900
我们不能冒险太接近地面挖隧道
We can't risk tunneling too close to the surface.

281
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,460
那怎么办
What do we do?

282
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,100
挖
We dig.

283
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,400
不瞒您说
Truth be told, uh,

284
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,160
布劳努先生还不算真正失踪
Mr. Blauner isn't officially a missing person,

285
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,960
但他的未婚妻有个堂妹在市长办公室工作
but his fiancee has a cousin at the mayor's office

286
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,600
所以  就是这样
so, here we are.

287
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,400
就是这样
Here we are.

288
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,930
但并不是说
Hey, that's not to say though that there

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,960
就没有可担心的事
aren't some things that concern me.

290
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
是吗  比如呢
Really? Such as?

291
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,860
怀特办公室收到的传真
Well, the fax that came into White's office

292
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,260
是在一家复印店传的
came from a copy shop,

293
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,200
但布劳努家里有传真机
but Blauner had a fax machine at his house.

294
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,730
还有呢
Okay.

295
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,130
他辞职大约半小时后
And about a half hour after he resigned,

296
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,060
有人看到他的车从伽特车库驶出
his car was seen leaving the GATE garage.

297
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,130
司机的身份现在无法确认
Now, the driver couldn't be identified,

298
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
但很明确驾驶员
but it appeared as though a woman's hands

299
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,600
是位女性
were seen gripping the steering wheel.

300
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,560
容我打断一下
Let me stop you right there.

301
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,400
我一直觉得布劳努先生
It always seemed to me that Mr. Blauner was,

302
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,600
怎么说比较恰当呢
how can I put this delicately,

303
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,560
是个"贱"客
um, a swordsman.

304
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,660
明白我的意思吗
You know what I mean?

305
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,230
说实话  不懂
Actually, I don't.

306
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,030
他可是到处播种
He might be dipping his snout into a different trough,

307
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,830
而她未婚妻却蒙在鼓里
and the fiancee is none the wiser.

308
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,230
但据其他同事所说
From what I've, uh, heard about him from his other co-workers,

309
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,230
这似乎不太可能
that doesn't sound too likely.

310
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,600
冒昧问一下  那个敲击声是怎么回事
If you don't mind me asking, what is that banging noise?

311
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,500
那是
That's, uh...

312
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,360
管道问题
it's trouble with the pipes.

313
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,160
是管道松了  以前有点震动
You know, they loosened up, it was a moderate quake

314
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,630
现在比以前震的更厉害了
and now they shake more than the trembler itself.

315
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,460
普发先生  有人告诉我
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh, some people here

316
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,100
你和布劳努有隙
have told me that you and Blauner didn't get along.

317
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,430
你能否说下这个问题
Would you mind talking to me a little bit about that?

318
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,230
几年前  我和一个搭档也用这招对付
A few years ago, a partner of mine did this same move

319
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,730
在新墨西哥边界抓到的
against an enemy combatant we picked up

320
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,660
犯人  这家伙嘴巴很紧
at the New Mexico border-- this guy didn't want to talk,

321
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,760
他什么都说不知道
he didn't know anything.

322
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,560
当时很有用  现在也应该行
It worked then, it should work now.

323
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,200
你给我们弄回来的救护车还在外面吗
Is that ambulance you got us still out back?

324
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,530
是的
Yeah.

325
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,700
加油  伙计  我当年追捕你们半天
Hey, come on, pal, I got almost a decade on you

326
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,160
都不见我喘半口气
and you don't see me sucking air.

327
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,400
布拉德  我中弹了
I got shot, Brad.

328
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,000
是啊
Oh, yeah.

329
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,330
兄弟们  没进展啊
Guys, we ain't making any progress here.

330
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,630
水泥层下只有花岗岩
There's nothing beneath this cement but granite.

331
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,630
用手提钻是穿不过去的
We couldn't get through it with a jackhammer.

332
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,830
也许我们该回仓库看看
Maybe we should go back to the warehouse,

333
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,130
另找出路
find another way.

334
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,830
没有其他出路  只有这里
There is no other way. This is it!

335
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,460
这就是计划所向  只能从这条路找"锡拉"
This is where the plans lead; this is our way to Scylla.

336
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,860
什么
What?

337
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,260
这排泄管里有数百万加仑的水
We got millions of gallons of water in this drain pipe.

338
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,330
我们下不去  也越不过去
We can't go under it, we can't go over it.

339
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,760
我知道
I know.

340
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,570
或许我们能穿过去
Maybe we can go through it.

341
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,190
松了
It's loose!

342
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,050
好了  林肯  这应该管用
All right, Linc, this ought to do it.

343
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,920
我搞定之后  我们有多长时间
After I'm done, how much time we got?

344
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,720
不多
Not a lot.

345
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,090
小心点
Be careful.

346
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,590
你也是
You, too.

347
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:12,520
我小时候  养了只公猫叫鲁弗斯
When I was a little boy, I had an old tomcat named Rufus.

348
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,090
它很擅长抓老鼠
He was a good mouser.

349
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,020
尖牙利爪  很彪悍的猫
Tough as nails, solid feline all around.

350
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,290
有一天  我在大卖场外面
One day, I bring home this little kitty

351
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,550
捡回一只小猫咪
from a giveaway box outside the Pic 'N Save.

352
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,750
老鲁弗斯一点也喜欢它
Old Rufus didn't like that one bit.

353
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,520
它耸起背  像响尾蛇一样丝丝叫
He arched his back, hissed like a rattlesnake

354
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,550
想弹簧刀一般伸出爪子
and sprang out his claws like a switchblade.

355
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,590
你知道
You know,

356
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,090
这小猫咪没做错什么
That new little kitty didn't do nothing wrong

357
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,220
只是个新来的
but be new.

358
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,990
我现在也是如此
Now, that's all I did.

359
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,350
我是新来的  布劳努是
I was being new, and Blauner was being

360
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,850
那只划清自己领地的老猫
this old tomcat spraying his territory.

361
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,220
但我不是针对他
Now, I don't hold that against him.

362
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,020
如果他不这么做  我倒会怀疑他人格有问题
If he didn't protect his turf I'd question his character.

363
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,650
但除了他的嫉妒以外
But aside from a little jealousy on his part,

364
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,320
我们之间就像纸一样薄
our issues were as thin as tissues.

365
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,450
我向你保证
I assure you that.

366
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,150
侦探  我把布劳努的行程安排
Detective, I pulled Blauner's travel schedule

367
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,520
-按你的要求打出来了  -谢谢
as per your request. Thank you.

368
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,690
这是怎么回事
Uh, what's this?

369
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,150
先生  我们得出去
Uh, sir, uh, we need to step out

370
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,690
拿一些做架子的角板
for a few more bracket-joints for the shelving.

371
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,820
没问题
Uh, all right, yeah.

372
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,890
但你们出去吃吃喝喝
But I ain't paying you to stop for, uh,

373
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,490
我可不会付钱给你们  快去快回
a coffee and donuts, so get back here toot sweet.

374
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,620
等等我  曼纽尔
Hey, wait up, Manuel.

375
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,620
我雇了几个人  当然是自己掏腰包
I hired some men, uh, out of my own pocket of course,

376
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,550
来修整一下
to, uh, add some built-in uh,

377
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,390
我的储物室  希望你别介意
uh, storage in my closet-- I hope you don't mind.

378
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,390
没问题
Nah.

379
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,550
这是他的每月细目
Here's the monthly breakdown of where he traveled...

380
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,620
你要跟我谈吗
You're gonna talk to me now?

381
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,490
我  不
Me? No.

382
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,590
我们没什么好谈的
We're done talking...

383
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,920
但你还得说
But you're not.

384
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,020
他们都死了  结束了
They are all dead. It's over.

385
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,750
一切都可以结束
This will all be over.

386
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,720
一切都可以结束
This will all be over.

387
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,150
完了
It's over.

388
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,220
他们都死了  他们都死了
They are dead. They are all dead.

389
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,550
结束了
It's over.

390
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,950
我要把这个拿走
I'm going to take this.

391
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,690
赛尔夫
Self...

392
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,620
你们能回避吗
Can you take a walk?

393
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,650
可以
Yeah.

394
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,590
走吧  莎拉  我们该走了
Come on, Sara, we should go.

395
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,120
我们出去吧
Let's go outside.

396
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,420
我儿子的尸检显示他
My son's autopsy report said that he'd...

397
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,790
他中了两枪
that he'd been shot twice.

398
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,050
一枪在肚子上
Once in the stomach...

399
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,320
为什么
Why, man?

400
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,720
为什么  就为了恐吓我妻子
Why?! Just to terrify my wife?!

401
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,350
五分钟后
And then a full five minutes later,

402
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,550
打在
right in the...

403
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,320
你也要承受一下
You too will suffer.

404
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,090
当
And when...

405
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,590
当你也无法承受疼痛时
and when you can't stand the pain anymore,

406
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,620
你就要为我打个电话
you'll make a phone call for me.

407
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,890
斯科菲尔德说酷刑没有用
You know, Scofield said that torture wouldn't work

408
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,750
因为将军会从你的声音中听出恐惧
because the General would hear the fear in your voice.

409
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,020
但事实上
But the thing is...

410
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,950
我正是要让电话那头的人
...I want the person on the other end

411
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,650
从你的声音中听到
of my call to hear the fear

412
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,020
恐惧
in your voice.

413
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,020
先生  这是新闻稿
Press release, sir.

414
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,620
简而言之  就是说福科斯河监狱的
In short, it sets forth that members

415
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,090
八个逃犯和帮凶
of the Fox River Eight and their accomplices

416
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,450
都还活着并就在洛城
are alive and well in Los Angeles.

417
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,890
你去哪了
Where have you been?

418
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,520
他们都死了
They are all dead.

419
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,520
-都结束了  -干得好
It's over. Good work.

420
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,350
你的报酬会放在约定的地方
Your payment will be left where we arranged.

421
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,520
这个已经没必要了
This is no longer necessary.

422
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,390
别轻举妄动
Go ahead.

423
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,420
秘密入口的
The access code

424
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,990
密码还是
to the covert entrance

425
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,820
你两个女儿的生日
is still both your daughters' birthdays.

426
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,420
所有人都出去
Everyone leave us alone.

427
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,190
我说
I said

428
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,850
所有人都出去
everyone leave us alone.

429
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,950
不会有事的
It's okay.

430
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,020
她不会伤害我
She won't hurt me.

431
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,020
丽莎
Lisa...

432
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,890
我就知道你会回家
I knew you'd come home.

433
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,390
你怎么挺得住
So, how are you holding up, you know,

434
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,190
没有LJ和大家陪在身边
not being with LJ and all?

435
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,450
没什么  他是个好孩子  他会照顾好自己
Good, he's a smart kid. He can look after himself.

436
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,020
我能看出来你很爱他
I can see it, how much you love him.

437
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,220
我还很小  我爸就去世了
My dad died when I was a little kid.

438
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,950
但他是个好父亲
But he was a good father.

439
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,820
我们还是集中精力完成任务吧
Let's just focus and get this thing done, all right?

440
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,590
迈克尔说手动控制
Michael said the manual override

441
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,190
应该就在主管道附近
should be somewhere near the main conduit.

442
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,220
你觉得这个像主管道吗
This look like the main conduit to you?

443
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,520
有办法弄明白
One way to find out.

444
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,650
你觉得这个像吗
That look like it to you?

445
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,690
像
Looks like it.

446
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,950
把它点着
Fire it up.

447
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,790
好了  我们走吧
All right, let's get out of here.

448
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,120
快点  哥们
Hurry up, bro!

449
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,120
就快好了 兄弟
Almost done, buddy.

450
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,950
好了  把它挪回去
All right, ease it back.

451
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,020
搞定了
It worked.

452
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,950
我们有多长时间
How long we got?

453
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,350
不清楚
I don't know.

454
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,650
千万人的水源被切断
Water cut off to thousands of people.

455
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,190
政府会在一个小时左右抢修
The city will probably have that taken care of in about an hour,

456
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,650
意味着我们有60分钟
which means we've got... 60 minutes

457
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,590
做90分钟的工作
to do 90 minutes worth of work.

458
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,820
否则我们就得不到"锡拉"
Or we don't get to Scylla.

459
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,650
怎么了  老兄
What's wrong, papi?

460
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,690
迈克
Mike.

461
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,990
迈克尔  迈克尔
Michael! Michael!

462
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,550
怎么了  兄弟
What's wrong, papi?!

463
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,890
兄弟  说话啊
Papi, talk to me!

464
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,920
你怎么了  说话啊
What's wrong?! Talk to me!

465
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,950
迈克尔
Michael!

466
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,520
迈克尔  你怎么了
Michael, what's wrong?!

467
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,160
想喝水吗
You want some water?

468
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,820
我没事
I'm okay.

469
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,020
兄弟  你现在背负过重
You're a lot of things right now, my friend,

470
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,390
而却没有背负"没事"
and okay ain't one of them.

471
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,860
你知道  我可能不是最聪明的人
You know, I may not be the smartest guy,

472
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,790
但我听到了
but I hear things.

473
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,220
莎拉和你哥哥
Sara and your brother

474
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,620
谈过有关你的身体健康的问题
have been talking about you not feeling well or something.

475
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,690
听着  我只是  只是说说
Look, I'm just, I'm just saying.

476
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,720
我需要你帮忙
I need your help.

477
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,460
所以  请你
So, please, just, uh...

478
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,820
帮我瞒着
...cover for me.

479
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
没问题
You got it.

480
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,590
事实上  格雷琴  我比你更了解你自己
Truth is, Gretchen, I know you better than you know yourself.

481
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,320
你一直这么跟我说
So you keep telling me.

482
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,620
我初次见你时  你才20岁
When I first met you, you were a 20 year old girl

483
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,760
由于心理评估失败
who'd just been dumped by the Wheeling Police Academy

484
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,920
你被惠灵警官学院开除了
for failing her psych evaluation.

485
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,490
但那些佛吉尼亚老脑筋
But where those good old West Virginia boys

486
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,890
只能看出一种具有
could only see an emotional disconnect

487
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,590
反社会倾向的情绪反常
with traces of sociopathic tendencies,

488
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,360
我看到的是一个能
I saw a Machiavellian streak

489
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,790
让失败成为不可能的足智多谋的人
that would make failure an impossibility.

490
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,420
我只能让怀特那么做
I had to let Wyatt do what he did

491
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,820
因为我想知道
because I needed to know...

492
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,720
是否我的斗牛犬已得知惠斯勒
...what my little bulldog may have known

493
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,720
以及他想得到关锡拉的计划
about Whistler and his plans for Scylla.

494
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,420
我说过我什么也不知道
I told you that I knew nothing.

495
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,860
你应该相信我
You should have believed me.

496
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,760
我知道你从不义气用事
I knew you'd never take it personally,

497
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,660
因为从你成为我的左右手开始
because you are, and have been

498
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,360
你就是  也一直是
ever since I took you under my wing...

499
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,090
我的女人
...my girl.

500
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,990
我的女人
My girl.

501
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,560
最敏感的神经末梢就在这里
The most sensitive nerve endings are right here.

502
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,320
这就是为什么针灸医生都会避免
That's why acupuncturists avoid placing needles

503
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,120
在任何接近这个位置用针  因为
anywhere near them because opening up

504
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,220
指尖的神经末端
the nerve endings in the fingertip--

505
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,720
就算只刺到一点
even a little pinprick--

506
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,160
都能引起极大的灼热痛楚
can result in quite a painful hot flash.

507
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,960
所以一根5英寸长的针
So a five inch needle

508
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,390
插入一指的长度
being driven up the length of the finger...

509
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,160
能让你体内感觉被火燃烧一般
...can make your insides feel like they're on fire.

510
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,090
生理学的另一方面说
Another fact of physiology,

511
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,860
当人体无法承受极端的压迫时会休克
the human body when in extreme duress begins to shut down.

512
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,190
大脑活动减弱  心率也会下降
Brain activity decreases and your heart rate slows

513
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,460
直到你再也感觉不到疼痛
until you just can't feel the pain anymore.

514
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,490
这就是心电图和电击的作用
And that's where the heart monitor and the battery come in.

515
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,820
因为当你的心率降到50以下
'Cause when your heart rate dips below 50,

516
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,520
电击就会给你一个苏醒的信号
that battery will give you a wake-up call,

517
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,660
避免你的身体休克
preventing your body from shutting down.

518
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,390
你才能感受到任何一丁点的
And then you will feel every ounce...

519
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,390
疼痛
of the pain.

520
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,720
到时候你会求着让我打电话
And that's when you're going to beg me to make the phone call.

521
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,620
有什么可以帮你吗
What can I do you for?

522
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,360
我在你的销售报告里找到
I... I found some more inconsistencies

523
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,490
一些矛盾的地方
in your sales reports.

524
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,760
听着
Listen up here.

525
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,190
你的电脑可不可以
From that little computer of yours,

526
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,120
读取伽特的数据
can you access into GATE's records?

527
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,790
如果用管理员身份登陆的话
If I access the network as an administrator,

528
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,060
我能以非pdf格式浏览文件
I can see the files in a non-PDF format.

529
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,390
我不知道什么意思  但我认为你可以办到
I don't know what that means, but I assume it was a yes.

530
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,890
所以随你怎么敲键盘
So you let your fingers do the walking across that keyboard

531
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,360
把我的销售报告拿给我
and you get me my sales records.

532
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,460
你弄伤我的手臂了
You are hurting my arm.

533
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,320
最好别让我伤害其他部位
And don't make me hurt any more of you.

534
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,560
现在就去
Now, go.

535
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,090
做的好
That's good work.

536
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
给
Here.

537
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,160
我要你测量下这个洞
I need you to measure this hole.

538
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,220
在对面的墙上打个同等大小的洞
And then make one of the same size in the wall opposite.

539
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,590
怎么弄
How?

540
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,120
你有系腰带吧
You got a belt?

541
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,790
好了
Okay.

542
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,990
在水再次灌满水管之前
We have less than 30 minutes

543
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,320
我们还有不到半小时时间
until this pipe is flooded with water again.

544
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,860
接受现实是很重要的  怀特
Acceptance is important, Wyatt.

545
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,320
我必须接受我儿子已经死了
I had to accept that my son is gone.

546
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,790
而你也必须接受你的生命
And you have to accept that your life,

547
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,560
你所剩无几的生命
your very, very short life-span ahead of you

548
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,260
将充满无法忍受的疼痛
is just going to be filled with agonizing pain.

549
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,060
直到你按我的要求去做
At least until you do what I've asked of you.

550
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,560
到那时
And then...

551
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,720
痛苦将会离你而去
then the pain will go away.

552
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,090
我们快没时间了
We're running out of time!

553
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,160
-不会吧  -怎么了
- Man.  - What's wrong?

554
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,590
这该死的东西居然空了
The stupid thing is empty!

555
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,680
那么
All right.

556
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,900
我进去吧
I'm coming in.

557
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,060
老兄  你不行了
You can't do this, bro.

558
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,290
赶紧干完再说
Just finish it.

559
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,720
喂
Hello?

560
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,020
是我
It's me.

561
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,820
怎么了
What's going on?

562
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,820
有人要告诉你一些事
Somebody needs to tell you something.

563
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,760
用她的姓称呼她
You call her by her first name.

564
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,460
潘姆
Pam...

565
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,020
我很抱歉
I'm... sorry.

566
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,060
一切都结束了
It's over.

567
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,060
我爱你
And I love you.

568
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,290
我爱你
I love you.

569
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,190
这东西太沉了
This thing is heavy!

570
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,160
太好了  苦力活干完了你们才来
Sure, show up when all the hard work is done.

571
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
好了  松后点
All right, ease it back.

572
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,590
我们听电台说
We heard on the radio

573
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,320
水利部门会在10分钟内恢复供水
that DWP is going to have the water running in 10 minutes.

574
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,760
你没事吧
You all right?

575
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,360
管子太重了
The sleeve is too heavy

576
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,990
很难塞过排水管
to just slide it through the pipe.

577
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,760
必须有2个人进去
Two of us are going to have to go inside

578
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,490
引它穿过另一个洞口
and guide it through that other hole.

579
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,090
水流随时可能从排水管冲过来
That pipe can flood at any time.

580
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,360
我上
I'll do it.

581
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
我也上
I'll go, too.

582
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,790
不  让我来
No, I'll go.

583
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,590
优等生  并非冒犯
Oh, no offense, college boy,

584
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,260
但这大家伙太重了
but this sucker's heavy.

585
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
你得再强壮点才行
You're going to need a little bulk down there.

586
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,020
好吧
All right.

587
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,020
你们把它推过另一边时
Use this to brace the sleeve

588
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,920
用这个支撑水管
when you pull it through to the other side.

589
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:41,190
然后  我们一起离开这里  好吗
And Let's get the hell out of there, all right?

590
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,160
艾咪还好吗
How's Emmy?

591
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,120
我来这不是听你
I didn't come here to listen to you

592
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,460
假装关心她  或关心我
Pretend to care about her...or me.

593
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,590
我来此是要告诉你  我是现在是空闲探员
I came here to tell you that I'm a free agent now.

594
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,620
我们经营的集团知道我还活着且可以雇用
The community we run with know that I'm alive and available.

595
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,690
我可以像为你卖命一样为他们卖命
I can just as easily work for one of them as I can for you.

596
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,990
所以问题在于  你出价多少
So the question is, what's your offer?

597
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,120
实际上  你的问题是
Actually, the question for you is

598
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,790
何必去其他地方呢
why would you want to go anywhere else?

599
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,290
现在不是记仇的时候  格雷琴
It's not a time for grudges, Gretchen.

600
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,920
是我们联手的时机
It's a time for coming together.

601
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,660
好日子就快到来了
The salad days are fast approaching.

602
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,160
老挝那边进展顺利
Laos worked perfectly.

603
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,520
民众很快会投奔我们
Soon the populace will turn to us--

604
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,920
军队  财政  能源的首领们
the leaders of the military,

605
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,990
都会与我们为伍
finance and energy-- to right the ship.

606
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,790
然后
And then...

607
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,860
我们就能依我们的设想重建这个国家
we'll rebuild this country in our own image.

608
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,190
格雷琴  我希望那时你可以在我身边
And when we do, I want you there beside me, Gretchen.

609
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,220
如我许诺过的  做我的副手
As my number two, like I always promised.

610
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,020
丽莎呢
What about Lisa?

611
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:52,760
我已经跟你说了
I've already told you.

612
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,890
你才是我的女人
You're my girl.

613
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,220
出来
Come on.

614
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,690
去那边
Over there.

615
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
就站那儿
Right up there.

616
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,860
你和我都是同一类人
You and I are the same,

617
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,990
阿历克斯
Alex.

618
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,920
我做过的事
I've done things...

619
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,390
用力推
Push!

620
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,560
继续推  继续
Keep going, keep going!

621
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,420
继续推  继续
Keep going! Keep going!

622
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,020
很好  就这样
Yeah, it's good right there.

623
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:11,860
够到了吗
You got it?

624
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,190
就这样
That's it.

625
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,960
我不知道这个能撑多久
I don't know how long that's going to hold.

626
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,960
我们只要把这个拉过去就行了
All we got to do is pull this thing through.

627
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,360
大家用力推
Oh, guys, push!

628
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,490
断了
Oh! It broke!

629
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,080
木桩断了
The brace is broke!

630
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,620
怀特先生
Mr. White...

631
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,390
很抱歉打扰你  我和莫拉侦探谈过后
I'm sorry to bother you, but, uh, after my talk

632
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,890
我一直在想布劳努先生
with Detective Mara, I was thinking about Mr. Blauner

633
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,520
和我之间的谈话
and some of the conversations we had.

634
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,560
推销员和渔夫很相似  不是吗
Salesmen are a lot like fishermen, right?

635
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,260
总是对自己的业绩夸夸其谈
Always bragging about their big catch.

636
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,860
但安迪却闭口不提他的业绩
Well, Andy never talked about his sales,

637
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,890
无论我如何旁敲侧击
No matter how much I pried.

638
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,490
所以我擅自查了一下
So I took the liberty of... looking them up.

639
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,290
表面  至少存在一些
And there were, to say the least...

640
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,190
不正常数据
irregularities.

641
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,590
安迪  下午好
Good afternoon to you, too, Andy.

642
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,590
你的2个大客户没有
Two of your top buyers don't have valid

643
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,960
合法社保号
Social Security numbers.

644
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,590
我查了那个他所谓的
I checked out the Social Security numbers

645
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,920
伽特工厂买主的社保号
of the clients he allegedly sold GATE workshops to.

646
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,290
有些纯粹是捏造的
In some cases the numbers are just pure fabrications.

647
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,120
但账务必须清算啊
But the checks must've cleared.

648
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,020
他之前肯定在洗钱
He's must've been money laundering for God only knows

649
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,560
天晓得用什么勾当
what kind of criminal exploits.

650
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,960
关键是
The point is...

651
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,260
如果那个执法长官拿到这份报告
if the good officer gets his hands on these papers, you know

652
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,290
你估计就得去见国税核对员了
you're going to be up to your eyeballs in IRS auditors.

653
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,990
我建议你跟莫拉先生说
I suggest you go tell Mr. Mara

654
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,060
你发现布劳努的帐有问题
that you found some irregularities in Blauner's expenses.

655
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,620
注销了私人物品  等等
Writing off personal matters, et cetera.

656
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,690
这就能解释他为会消失
This will explain why he disappeared

657
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,920
也可以息事宁人
and will placate the po-po.

658
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,460
好吧
Okay.

659
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,490
听着  侦探
Listen, Detective...

660
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,820
把它抬起来
Pick it up! Pick it up!

661
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,190
抬不起来  太重了
I can't, it's too heavy!

662
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,490
支柱肯定是断了
The brace must have snapped.

663
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,190
试试把它抬起来
Let's try and get it up!

664
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,020
根本动不了
It's not moving!

665
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,420
水来了
The water's coming.

666
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,860
水来了  出来
The water's coming! Come on!

667
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,290
我们只能把它留在那了
We got to leave it there.

668
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,260
这样就再也拿不到"锡拉"了
But then we'll never get Scylla.

669
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,490
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

670
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,460
你没有  我有
You don't, I do.

671
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,020
你这是干嘛
What the hell are you doing?!

672
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,660
你这是干嘛
What the hell are you doing?!

673
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,690
布拉德  别这样  布拉德
Brad, don't do this! Brad!

674
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,890
抓住它  快
Grab it, grab it, now!

675
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,160
水来了
The water's coming!

676
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,460
出来吧  快
Get your ass up here, now!

677
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,890
加把劲
Come on, come on!

678
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,220
你听到没有
You hear that?

679
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,660
他们往管子里注水了
They're flooding the pipe.

680
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,990
林肯  快出来
Linc! Get out of there!

681
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,090
太吵了  他听不到
It's too loud, he can't hear you!

682
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,090
林肯
Linc!

683
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,060
快点儿  你现在还能
Come on, man, there's still enough room

684
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,190
从洞里钻出来
for you to get through the hole.

685
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,060
我一放手你会抓不住的
I let go of this you could drop it.

686
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,060
它太重了
It's too heavy!

687
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,360
布拉德  放下管子
Brad, drop the sleeve

688
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,760
赶快出来
and get out of there!

689
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,420
别这么做
Don't do this.

690
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,920
你还有个儿子
You have a son!

691
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,760
别这么做  别这么做
Don't do this. Don't do this!

692
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,910
推  推吧  斯科菲尔德
Push it! Push it, Scofield!

693
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,780
快点  推过去
Come on,push it through!

694
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,760
推
Push!

695
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,160
推啊
Push it!

696
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,990
快推
Push it! Push it!

697
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,760
布拉德  布拉德  不
Brad! Brad, no!

698
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,990
布拉德
Brad!

699
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,420
布拉德  不
Brad, no!

700
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,760
布拉德
Brad! Brad!

701
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,960
布拉德
Brad!

702
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,760
布拉德  不
Brad, no!

703
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,720
布拉德
Brad! Brad!

704
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,090
你们可以进来了
You can all come back in now.

705
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,190
一切正常
Everything's fine.

706
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,790
一向如此
It always was.

707
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,460
你还好吧
You're okay?

708
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,120
再好不过
Couldn't be better.

709
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,390
更重要的是  "锡拉"怎么样了
More important: what's happening with Scylla?

710
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,060
我会私下告诉你
I'll tell you in private.

711
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,220
你可以当着格雷琴的面告诉我
You can tell me in front of Gretchen.

712
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,460
等我说完一些话再说
Not until I say something else.

713
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,860
你要是再拿着枪靠近他
If you ever come near him with a gun again...

714
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,190
你会怎样
You'll what?

715
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,420
够了
That will do.

716
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,090
"锡拉"
Scylla.

717
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,760
我们安排保安就位的情况
We got preliminary safeguards in place

718
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,290
比预期的快
faster than we expected.

719
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,160
如果需要  我们明天就能转移"锡拉"
We could move Scylla tomorrow if we wanted,

720
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,790
但现在怀特已经除掉了斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
but now that Wyatt's eliminated Scofield and Burrows,

721
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,320
也就没必要了
there's no need.

722
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯死了
Scofield and Burrows are dead?

723
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,620
死了
Dead as Latin.

724
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,090
按原计划进行
Go ahead with the plan.

725
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,120
如果几个伊州小子
If a couple of boys from Illinois

726
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,460
都能这么接近  那就该重新布局了
could get that close, it's time to mix things up.

727
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,520
我要"锡拉"明天之内移出洛城
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.

728
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,220
他不肯爬上来
He wouldn't climb up.

729
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,290
他就是不肯爬上来
He just wouldn't climb up.

730
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,320
南边的管子通到哪儿
Where does the south pipe lead to?

731
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,390
-或者我们可以沿着它  -不
Maybe we can follow... No.

732
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,890
不  他死了
No, he's gone.
