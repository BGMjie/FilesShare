我警告过你别来  迈克

我不会告诉任何人的

他不是一个无关的人  林肯

他和克里斯蒂娜一直互通邮件

52
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,730
林肯

54
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,000
我不知道
No.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,560
"锡拉"在什么地方
Where's Scylla?!

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,800
你准备好了吗

用的是圣丁斯奇的电话
On Sandinsky's phone.

62
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,360
我以为他把电话关了
I thought he turned it off.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,160
现在是开着的  追踪信号
Well, now it's on. Track it.

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,300
迈克
Michael?

65
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,090
喂  克里斯蒂娜
Hello, Christina.

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,090
我希望 你对我说实话

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,330
我们从文森特・圣丁斯奇说起

文森特・圣丁斯奇  那个科学家吗
Vincent Sandinsky the scientist?

他是我的老朋友

70
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,400
有点让人讨厌  你觉得呢
A bit of a bore, don't you think?

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,500
但谁管他呢
But who cares about him?

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,560
我更想谈谈你的问题
I'd rather talk about you.

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,060
我想和你面对面谈
I'd rather meet you face-to-face.

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,600
除非你把"锡拉"带来  否则免谈
Unless you're bringing me Scylla, I'm not interested.

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,400
没有"锡拉"  就别想见面
No Scylla, no meeting.

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
这是我唯一的条件
That's all I can offer.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,300
你的目标是什么
What do you hope to accomplish?

00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,260
十分钟内给我答案  
I need your answer in ten minutes, 

79
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,300
那将是我最后一次给你打电话
And that's the last time i'm calling back.

80
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,160
找到他了
And found him.

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,600
他在埃尔波特尔的工业区
He's in an industrial park in El Portal.

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,700
就在海边

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,830
很好
All right,

84
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,230
我们行动
Let's go.

85
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,330
你撒谎  你撒谎
You're lying, you're lying.

86
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,430
我不是公司的人
I don't work for the company,

87
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,660
你就是谎话连篇
Six words that never prove true.

88
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,330
你玩完了  认命吧
Come on, man, this is over, look around!

89
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,630
你还想耍什么把戏
What are you doing here?!  

90
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,830
我发誓什么都不知道
I swear I don't know anything, I do.

91
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,430
他说的我一点都不知道
I don't know what he's talking about.

92
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,290
我是来开会的
I am here for a conference,

93
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,080
就这么多  我不知道其他人说了什么
That's all, I don't know who told you otherwise.

94
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,790
我知道了
I do,

95
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,050
迈克也一句实话没说
And Michael's also full of crap.

96
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,300
-他没理由撒谎  -事实上  他有
- He's got no reason to lie.  - Actually, he does.

97
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,160
迈克给我们假情报  就能找机会插手
Michael's leading us off the scent, so he can get in...

98
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,780
他和我们一样  
He doesn't want Christina to have Scylla

99
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,790
不想让克里斯蒂娜得到"锡拉"
Any more than we do.

100
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,090
他对我们撒谎  不是一两次了
It's not the first time he's lied to us.

101
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,630
"锡拉"在什么地方
Where is it?

102
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,800
-林肯  -算了  林肯
- Linc.  - Come on, Linc,

103
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,460
他要是死了  线索就断了
He can't talk if he's dead.

104

-最后三秒钟  -别开枪

而且你能帮我找到克里斯蒂娜・斯科菲尔德

但是  你早就知道了

他一个人就能解决

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,530
一天
One day.

159
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,960
是你告的密
You tipped him off.

160
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,760
巴格韦尔  你回来
No, Bagwell.

161
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,200
你呆在这里
You stay here.

162
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,700
对  蒂博格
Yeah, Theodore.

163
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,860
他更需要你
He needs you.

164
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,100
你最好离我们都远点
But you'd better stay away from us.

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,130
这就是迈克打电话的地方
This is where Michael's signal is coming from?

166
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,760
-是的  -太好了
- Yeah.  - Perfect.

167
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,160
小心
Be careful.

168
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,460
呆在这儿
Stay here.

169
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,170
检查一下
Check it out.

170
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,660
快点
Let's go.

171
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,800
快点
Let's go!

172
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,000
他要跑
He's leaving.

173
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,780
快点  他跑不了多远  
Come on, he can't be that far away.

174
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,400
追上他
Let's go.

175
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,730
快出去
Out.

176
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,930
跟我走吧
Let's go.

177
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,180
好了
All right.

178
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,480
"锡拉"在哪里
Where is it?

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,450
你知道我不会说的  对不对
You don't really expect me to answer that, do you?

180
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,610
实际上  你会说
Actually, I do,

181
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,080
不说你就死命一条
Because your life depends on it,

182
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,480
根据你的记录
And considering your track record,

183
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,780
我可以很保守地估计
I think it's safe to assume

184
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,010
你总是为自己着想
That you're always looking out for number one.

185
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,240
迈克  这一天我等了25年了
I've waited 25 years for this moment, Michael.

186
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,980
我不可能把我知道的全告诉你
There's no way I can say everything I want to say.

187
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,950
我为什么要让你说
Why should I let you?

188
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,010
因为我是你的母亲
Because I'm your mother.

189
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,750
有些事情是改变不了的
That's something you can't change.

190
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,750
是忘不掉的
It's something you can't take away.

191
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,580
很高兴见到你  莎拉
It's nice to meet you, Sara.

192
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,510
迈克能认识你
In some ways, Michael's done very well

193
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,740
是他福气好
For himself.

194
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,850
至于其他  我就不敢那么说了
In other ways, i'm not so sure.

195
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,040
林肯让你走了一条艰难的路
Lincoln has led you down a dark path.

196
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,680
我自己决定的
I make my own decisions.

197
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,410
你帮林肯逃出监狱
You break Lincoln out of prison

198
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,210
他却帮克兰兹将军做事
And he goes to work for general Krantz.

199
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,010
他有他自己的理由
And he has his reasons.

200
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,950
如果你想找我们之间的共同点
But if you're looking for some kind of common ground

201
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,850
我觉得就那么多了
Between us, maybe that's it.

202
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,880
我也不想让林肯给公司卖命
I don't want to see Lincoln working for the company, either.

203
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,440
最少你不再给他找借口了
At least you've stopped making excuses for him.

204
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,710
我只是不再用主观考虑问题
I stopped making judgments.

205
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,580
我已经不能那么做了
Something I couldn't afford.

206
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,480
这些都是以前的问题了
But that was a long time ago,

207
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,710
这不是我们谈话的主题
And that's not why we're here.

208
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,410
我知道
No.

209
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,880
你是对的
You're right.

210
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
我们都不想公司得到"锡拉"
None of us wants to see Scylla go back to the company.

211
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,850
如果我们能摒弃前嫌
So, if we can put the past behind us,

212
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,410
我们还是可以做到的
Maybe we can work something out.

213
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,850
举个例子
Like what?

214
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,010
做个交易
Like a deal.

215
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,450
交易
"A deal"?

216
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,140
好吧
All right,

217
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,610
你告诉我"锡拉"在哪
You tell me where Scylla is,

218
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,780
我们再讨论细节
And we'll work out the details later.

219
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,410
我们五五分
We'll go 50-50.

220
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,740
母子行动
A mother-son operation?

221
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,010
可能
Maybe.

222
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,810
首先  "锡拉"
But first, Scylla.

223
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,550
算了吧  迈克  我更了解
Please, Michael, I know better.

224
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,280
我们是一类人
We're very similar.

225
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,850
我知道  当我们看着一个事物
I know what it's like to look at the big picture,

226
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,480
想到的却是所有小的零件
See all the little moving parts...

227
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,450
手术之后大脑更灵活了
How much easier it is to think after the surgery.

228
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,150
我了解你
I know you.

229
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,610
这就是为什么你不可能
That's why you'll never be able to manipulate me

230
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,380
像操纵其他人一样操纵我
Like you do the rest of the world.

231
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,780
你没时间了
You're running out of time.

232
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,210
里面没人
All right, there's no one back here!

233
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,680
他们刚刚还在 
Well, they were here, but of course,

234
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,740
但是现在肯定没人
There's nobody here now.

235
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,080
总是这样
'Cause that's what happens.

236
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,940
你们说呢
You know, this

237
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,480
所有的事情
Whole thing...

238
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,610
全部都是
It's just...

239
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,050
全部都是垃圾
It's just... crap!

240
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,580
我们总是比别人慢一步
We're always one move behind,

241
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,980
每次都是这样
Every step of the way.

242
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,180
而且巴格韦尔现在小人得志
Yeah, and it's just going to get worse now that 

243
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,780
更让我们觉得难受
Bagwell is breathing down our backs.

244
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,710
你怎么能犯那种错误
How do you make that kind of mistake, huh?!

245
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,810
让那个垃圾和我们在一起
And let that inbred get anywhere near us.

246
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,110
不  我们就不该为克兰兹做事
No, no, no, the first mistake was working for Krantz.

247
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,090
对  那是第一个错误  
Okay, that was the first mistake. 

248
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,910
那你觉得以后会怎么样
what do you think's going to happen now 

249
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,910
他和他的狐朋狗友作威作福
that he's in town and he has his goons

250
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,150
我们现在怎么办
Calling the shots? what's going to happen now?

251
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,980
我在这些事情发生前
Yeah, I should've known better

252
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,080
就应该想到的
Than to get anywhere near this.

253
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,110
好了  我们该走了
All right, you know what? we should go.

254
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,350
-我们走吧  -我们不能走
- Let's go.  - No, we can't go,

255
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,010
你看过那些照片了
Because you saw the photos,right?

256
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,110
所以你应该知道
You saw the photos, so you know

257
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,280
他会对他们做什么
what he's going to do with them.

258
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,740
我们早该知道他会对他们做什么了
We should have known what he was going to do with them!

259
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,870
我们应该早就知道  
That's what we should've... 

260
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,580
冷静下来
Hey, hey, hey! just calm down.

261
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,180
说实话吧  交易吹了
You know what, the deal is over.

262
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,510
你知我知
Okay? you know it, i know it.

263
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,580
所有人都知道  我们永远也逃不掉了
Everybody knows it. we're not getting out of here!

264
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,610
要不我们自己走向绞刑架
We're going to take a walk right to the gallows,

265
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,480
要不就是其他人把我们干掉
Or somebody else is going to stab us in the back!

266
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,010
我以前也遇到过  但我活下来了
I did that walk and I survived.

267
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,680
就算我们赢了
Even if we win,

268
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,780
我们就真的赢了吗
Do we win?

269
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,010
你也不信的  对吧
You don't believe that, do you?

270
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,580
我会去做该做的
Look, i'm going to do what i got to do.

271
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,080
你要不想和我一起  随你
If you don't want to roll with me, that's fine.

272
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,980
这是什么
What is that?

273
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,280
租借收据  银色小货车
Rental receipt, a silver minivan.

274
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,080
这是什么
What is this?

275
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,280
你对这个了解多少
What do you know about this?

276
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,740
我们在小古巴
We found a whole

277
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,380
发现了一箱子这个
Box of them down in Little Cuba.

278
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,410
还有很多枪
Guns, too.

279
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,710
你对这个了解多少
What do you know about this?

280
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,410
她想让我在那儿演讲
She wanted me to speak there.

281
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,110
是关于锡拉吗
About Scylla?

282
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,540
她说会提前给我讲稿  
She said she'd give me the script beforehand, 

283
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,880
我只知道这个
that's all I know.

284
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,840
她说只是纯粹对科学感兴趣
She said her interest was purely scientific.

285
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,280
她的兴趣是财富
Her interest was financial.

286
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,680
一年前她找到我  说了自己的想法
She came to me about a year ago with an idea.

287
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,740
她并不想利用锡拉作为永久的基石
Rather than build our organization

288
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,550
来巩固我们的组织
With Scylla as the permanent cornerstone,

289
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,710
而是想利用这项发明
She wanted to use the technology

290
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,780
赚取短期利润
To make a quick profit.

291
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,680
如果发生了什么
If certain events occurred,

292
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,640
很多国家会觉得
Various nations might feel the need

293
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,250
这种现代防御系统很有必要
For a more modern defense system,

294
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,610
他们就会问我们要
And they'd come to us for the answers.

295
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,210
太阳能武器
Solar weaponry.

296
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,210
水去盐技术
Water desalination.

297
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,740
现在告诉我们吧
Now, what do you know about all this?

298
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,550
知道的我都说了
I told you all I know.

299
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,080
这主意太疯狂了
Well, I thought it was a crazy idea.

300
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,710
外行人的计划
Plan of an amateur.

301
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,580
但我猜她会火冒三丈
But I figured she'd be angry.

302
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,050
她没资格持有卡
She wasn't allowed to hold a card.

303
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,680
你想说什么
Now, what was that?

304
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,180
远不止这些
I think it's more than that.

305
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,380
是嘛
Really?

306
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,650
她告诉你什么了
What did she tell you?

307
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,910
我知道公司运作的方式
I know how the company operates.

308
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,610
像艾克菲尔德那样的假公司
Shell corporations like Ecofield,

309
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,150
大量的经费滥用
Rampant misuse of funds.

310
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,350
你的确是坐在金矿上
You're literally sitting on a gold mine.

311
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,610
但你的领导
But your leadership

312
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,280
只利于你和你朋友
Only benefits you and your friends

313
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,080
及今后十代的发展
Ten generations in the future.

314
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,840
而你
And you

315
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,410
希望看到公司从内部瓦解
Would like to see the company implode?

316
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,580
我希望看到改观
I want to see something happen.

317
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,880
你简直是鼠目寸光
You think too small.

318
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,610
老挝
Laos?

319
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,940
得利前  我们都会没命
We'll all be dead before that pays off.

320
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,880
老挝指什么
Uh, "Laos," sir?

321
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,810
你不必多问
Don't trouble yourself.

322
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,210
布鲁斯
Burrows?

323
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,840
我有个问题问你的朋友
I got a question for your friend.

324
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,110
什么问题
What is it?

325
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,980
问他DMB是什么意思
Ask him what the letters "DMB" mean.

326
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,480
DMB对你  有什么特殊含义吗
Do the letters "DMB" mean anything to you?

327
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,110
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,780
我以为你有点眼色的
I thought you understood me.

329
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,740
她说东西放在
She said her place was

330
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,910
戴德迈阿密银行那儿
On the same block as Dade-Miami bank.

331
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,640
听到了吗
Did you hear that?

332
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,680
知道了
I got it.

333
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,710
他最好说的是实话
He'd better be telling the truth.

334
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,610
看教授还知道什么
See what else the doctor knows.

335
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,480
-不要啊  -克里斯蒂娜的计划是什么
- No... - What's Christina's plan?!

336
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,010
我不知道
I don't know.

337
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,410
不知道
I don't know.

338
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,080
也许我们应该
Maybe we should've...

339
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,410
也许我们应该跟踪她什么的
Maybe we should've followed her or something.

340
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,240
坐下
Sit down for me.please.

341
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,450
我和她谈谈如何
How about I talk to her?

342
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,840
也许我有不同的理解
I might have some perspective.

343
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,680
毕竟我妈妈没有在我6岁时丢下我
She didn't leave me when I was six.

344
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,080
好的
Okay.

345
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,780
莎拉  很遗憾我们以这种方式见面
I'm sorry we had to meet this way, Sara.

346
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,010
我很遗憾我们竟然会见面
I'm sorry we had to meet at all.

347
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,880
迈克在去年经受了
Michael's been through a lot in

348
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,810
太多痛苦
the last year at some point.

349
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,380
他已经不堪重负
It's going to be too much for him.

350
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,980
迈克可以处理好的
Michael can handle it.

351
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,680
他习惯于充满变化的生活
He's never known a life without change.

352
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,150
你说得好像很了解他一样
Oh, you say that like you know him.

353
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,680
没错
Oh, I do.

354
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,080
比你了解多了
Better than you.

355
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,250
这不太可能吧
I don't see how that's possible.

356
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,650
你生下孩子时就知道了
Well, you will when your child's born.

357
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,330
起初我并不确定  
See, I wasn't sure at first, 

358
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,380
但你脸色不好
But you do have that drawn look.

359
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,740
而且我看到你面对危险时
And I see the way you protect yourself

360
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,810
保护自己的方式
when you sense danger.

361
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,680
你自己察觉不到  这是本能
You don't even know you're doing it. It's instinct.

362
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,740
你对母性本能了解多少
And what is it you know about maternal instinct?

363
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,250
我尝试当个好母亲
I've tried to be a mother.

364
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,980
甚至是对于林肯
Even to Lincoln.

365
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,910
你怎么好意思说
How can you say that?

366
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,710
你一句话不说就抛下他们
You left them without so much as an explanation.

367
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,040
但如果迈克听...
But if Michael would listen...

368
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,040
知道吗  你可以停手了
You know what? you can stop.

369
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,850
你没资格为自己的行为辩解
You can't justify what you did.

370
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,940
迈克不知道你怀孕了
Michael doesn't know you're pregnant,

371
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,710
对吧
Does he?

372
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,010
怎么了
What happened?

373
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,810
她什么都没说
Uh... I got nothing.

374
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,180
你好  乔伊丝
Hello, Joyce.

375
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,410
你好  我叫当・赛尔夫
How are you? my name is Don Self,

376
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,580
是国土安全局的
Homeland Security.

377
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,080
别担心  没什么事
Don't worry, there's nothing the matter.

378
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,880
我只是帮朋友一个忙
I'm just here doing a favor for my friend.

379
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,180
他妈妈昨天去世了
See, his mother passed away yesterday.

380
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,640
她最后的愿望和遗嘱
Okay, and her last will and testament

381
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,150
放在你们这儿一个安全箱中
Is in one of your security boxes.

382
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,710
是6468号
It's actually box 6468.

383
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,040
有许可吗
Is he authorized to access it?

384
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,440
这就是问题了  他没有
See, that's the problem. he's not.

385
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,410
但我们可以填写单据
But we're willing to fill out all the paperwork...

386
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,510
抱歉  只有获得许可的个人
I'm sorry. only authorized individuals

387
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,840
才能够取得安全箱
Are allowed to access safe deposit...

388
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,310
女士  我必须拿到那箱子
Listen, lady, I need to get in that box.

389
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,740
你们老板在哪
Where's your boss?

390
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,540
先生  有什么要帮忙的吗
Sir? sir, can I help you?

391
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,810
我要拿到我妈妈的安全箱
Yeah.I need to get in my mom's safe deposit box.

392
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,440
-你有法院命令吗  -没有
- Do you have a court order?  - No. no.

393
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,840
DMB政策不允许任何人...  
DMB policy prevents anyone... 

394
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,340
这就是政策
Here's the policy.

395
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,080
我要开6468号箱子  就现在
Okay, I need to open box 6468. Right now. 

396
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,250
我是当・赛尔夫  国土安全局的
Name's Don Self, Homeland Security.

397
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,010
打扰了  弗兰克先生
Excuse me,Mr. Frank?

398
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,110
6468号一分钟前刚被人取走
Number 6468 was accessed a minute ago.

399
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,310
他刚离开
He just left.

400
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,750
是一个带着银色手提箱的男的
It was the guy with the silver suitcase.

401
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,880
他在那里
There he is.

402
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,010
看起来像是大使馆里的那个
Hey, that looks like the guy from the embassy.

403
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,080
班纳吉先生  你好吗
Mr. Banerjee, how are you?

404
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,010
我试着联系克里斯蒂娜・汉普顿
I'm trying to reach Christina Hampton.

405
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,790
她现在正在开会
She's in a meeting right now.

406
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,710
五点前无法联系上
I don't talk to her before five.

407
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,750
交易就取消
The deal is off.

408
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,040
听好
Okay.

409
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,840
这是我的最后提议
This is my final offer.

410
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,510
你带我找到"锡拉"
You're going to take me to Scylla,

411
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,910
就可以走了
And then you can walk.

412
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,910
没有质问
No questions.

413
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,180
也没人去告诉将军
No one tells the General.

414
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,910
你下半辈子可以安稳生活
You can live the rest of your life

415
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,040
就像这一切没有发生过
Like this never happened,

416
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,110
但是"锡拉"是我的
But Scylla is mine.

417
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,910
林肯绝不会放手不管的
Lincoln would never let that happen.

418
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,980
他没必要知道
He doesn't have to know.

419
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
你们小时候就总是不合
Even as children, you couldn't agree.

420
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,180
你们常常争吵
You fought about everything.

421
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,910
你们俩太不一样了
The two of you couldn't be more different.

422
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,910
但你知道的  是吧  迈克
But you know that, don't you, Michael?

423
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,380
这不关林肯的事
This isn't about Lincoln.

424
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,810
你的眼睛是蓝色的  而他是绿色的
You have blue eyes, he has green.

425
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,580
他去玩卡车
He played with trucks.

426
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,540
而你把电视机给拆了
You took apart the television set.

427
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,540
我没必要指出
And I don't need to point out

428
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,080
你们的智商
The difference in IQ

429
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,950
或者是性情的区别
Or temperament.

430
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,250
你知道我在说什么
You know what I'm getting at,

431
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,450
是吧  迈克
Don't you, Michael?

432
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,340
我不知道
I don't have any idea

433
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,640
你在说什么
What you're talking about.

434
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,810
心底里你其实一直都知道
You've always known it deep in your heart.

435
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,810
只是没人能来证实
You just had no one to confirm it.

436
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,910
林肯
Lincoln...

437
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,250
不是你的亲生哥哥
...Isn't your brother.

438
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,710
这是真的
It's true.

439
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,840
我应该早点告诉你
I should have told you before,

440
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,980
但你一直很敬仰他
But you always looked up to him, and

441
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,810
我没想到事情会发展到这个地步
I had no idea things would happen like this.

442
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,880
你不知道你在说什么
You don't know what you're saying.

443
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,380
你有见过
Have you ever

444
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,780
林肯婴儿时候的相片吗
Seen pictures of Lincoln as a baby?

445
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,180
-当然  -没有
- Yes. - No.

446
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,810
根本就没有
There aren't any.

447
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,870
他3岁时你父亲收养了他
Your father didn't adopt him until he was three years old.

448
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,250
他父母为公司效力
His parents worked for the company.

449
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,180
他们在马尼拉的一次爆炸中丧生
They were killed in an explosion in Manila.

450
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,010
奥尔多第二天把他带回家
Aldo brought him home the next day.

451
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,080
他觉得那是他的责任
He felt it was his duty.

452
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,550
却无视我的感受
He didn't ask me how I felt.

453
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,980
我和他之间从未有过
I...I never bonded with him

454
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,540
母子之间的感情
Like mother and son.

455
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,080
所以他总是很气愤
He was always so angry.

456
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,810
就算可以理解
Understandably so...

457
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,340
但他还是太小  记不清他的亲生母亲
He was too young to remember his mother, but

458
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,580
可他一直都知道少了什么东西
He always knew something was missing.

459
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,610
可恶  你竟然用这一招
I can't believe you're playing this card.

460
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,280
对不起  迈克
I'm sorry, Michael.

461
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,710
但我对你的感觉是不同的
But I felt differently about you.

462
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,280
你能体会到
And you could tell.

463
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,980
所以你才一直有内疚感
That's why you always felt guilty.

464
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,210
所以你总在林肯必死无疑时  
Why you were always throwing yourself over the cliff

465
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,110
奋不顾身  前来救他
After Lincoln was already dead at the bottom.

466
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,980
所以你才进了监狱  毁了原来的生活
It's why you went to prison and pissed your life away.

467
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,410
你不会明白为什么
You don't know why I did

468
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,580
我会做这些
The things I did!

你根本就不在我身边
You weren't there!

470
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,880
天知道你本该有多大的成就
Who knows what you could have accomplished.

471
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,180
可你一直觉得必须收敛自己的锋芒
But you always felt like you had to make less of yourself

472
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,150
才不至于让林肯太可悲

林肯胜过亲兄
Lincoln was more of a brother to me 

474
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,940
而你枉为人母
than you were ever a mother.

475
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,080
你抛弃了我
You left.

476
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,150
他陪伴着我
He stayed.

477
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:49,710
他供养我
He fed me.

478
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,740
让我不至于颠沛流离
Kept me off the streets.

479
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,310
供我读书

480

怎么做到的
How?

481
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,510
让你不停的陷入麻烦吗
By getting in trouble over and over again,

482
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,310
就像他现在那样
Just like he is right now.

483
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,940
现在是什么意思
What do you mean, right now?

484
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,280

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,940
去找"锡拉"  但他是不会找到的
Looking for Scylla, and he's not going to find it.

487
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,150
也许你该打电话告诉他
Maybe you should call him and tell him.

488
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,980
除非你们之间
Unless there's too much

489
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,350
感情很差
Bad blood between you.

490
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,150
或根本毫无感情
Or no blood.

491
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,710
谁打过来的
Who's the guy in the ring?

492
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,540
是迈克吗
Is it Michael?

493
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,880

I am. Just shut up.

497
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,680
不是我不想帮你
It's not that I don't want to help you.

498
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,920
只是我不愿再看见你为了他牺牲自己
It's just that I hate to see you go running after him again.

499
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,510
迈克  别这样
Michael. Come here!

500
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,250

好吧  你想为了他

布鲁斯在追我  你还好吧

我还担心你逃不出来呢

别人告诉我  你会打来的

655
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,710
因为晚上的安排拖了一会

现在做决定已经太迟了
