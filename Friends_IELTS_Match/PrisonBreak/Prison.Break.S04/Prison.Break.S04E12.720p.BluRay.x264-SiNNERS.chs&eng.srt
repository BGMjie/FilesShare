2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,900
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,300
从现在开始  我要求每个人
From now on, I'm asking

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,330
任何时候  都把卡放在
that everyone keep their card on them.

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,070
自己的身上
At all times.

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,570
格雷琴没拿到第六张卡
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,570
那我们怎么办
So where does that leave us?

8
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,470
但格雷琴给了你一份资料
You know, Gretchen did pass on this one piece of information for you.

9
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,100
应该对你有帮助
It's gonna be helpful.

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,170
我接到一位老友的电话  听说"锡拉"有眉目
I got a call from an old friend, heard Scylla was

11
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,370
他想知道
in play and he wants to know

12
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,870
他能否弄到手  我找了个安全的地方
if he can get in on it. I've set up a safe house

13
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,330
在那可以跟他谈
where you can hear him out.

14
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,700
-你有笔吗  -等一下
Do you have a pen? Just a minute.

15
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,630
皮尔蒙特街1917号
1917 Piermt.

16
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,600
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self...

17
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,970
我们已恭候多时
we've been waiting.

18
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,100
斯科菲尔德和布伦斯从那扇门
When Scofield and Burrows walk

19
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,600
走出来  给他们一次
rough the door, give them

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,730
投降的机会
an opportunity to surrender.

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,600
他们不可能乖乖地束手就擒的
There's no way they're gonna hand it over without a fight.

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
如果他们动手  我们以牙还牙
If they take that position, we'll respond in kind.

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,470
我们走错一步
We make one wrong move,

24
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,660
监视器就会启动
the camera goes on,

25
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,270
克兰兹将军就会发现我们
And General  Krantz will know we're inside.

26
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,600
马上派一队人下去
I need a team downstairs now!

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,570
应该不会等很久
Shouldn't be long.

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,000
你确定我们不用下去等
You sure we shouldn't be waiting down there

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
迈克尔带着"锡拉"出来吗
for Michael to leave with Scylla.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
如果你懂战术的话
If you knew anything about tactics,

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,670
这里就是所谓的制高点
you would know this is the high ground.

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,030
况且我们有消声器
Besides we have silencers.

33
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,530
"锡拉"不是一张卡
So, Scylla isn't one card.

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,830
而是六张
It's six.

35
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,230
确定他没带炸药后
Make sure he's not armed with explosives.

36
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,000
就杀了他
Then kill him.

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,370
把枪放下
Drop 'em.

38
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,570
不然  我就打爆他的头
Or I blow his head clean off.

39
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
你该把枪放下
You're gonna want to put that down.

40
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,570
你放不放
You're gonna want to put that down.

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,430
把枪放下
Lower your weapons.

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,530
快点  过去
Come on. Get over there.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,100
快点  老头
Come on,old man.

44
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,870
由世上最聪明的人设计出的安全系统
The best minds in the world designed this security system,

45
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,900
你几乎把它打破了
and you almost beat it.

46
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,700
不用太伤心嘛
The frustration must be killing you.

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,470
你输定了
You blew it.

48
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,970
其实
Actually...

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,000
万事俱备  只欠东风
there's only one missing piece of the puzzle.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,170
你正好把它带来了
And you just brought it to me.

51
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,000
我不知道你说的是什么
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
你的"锡拉"卡
Your Scylla card.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,670
给我
Now.

54
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,100
和你预想的不一样
Not what you expected?

55
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,470
我预想的是
What I expect

56
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,270
你占具这个系统的所有优势
of a man like you is a system where you've got all the advantage.

57
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,500
看起来  你缺几张卡
Looks like you're a few cards short.

58
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,070
想不到吧  将军
Suck it, General.

59
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,070
你是我见过的最差劲的拍档
You're the worst partner I've ever worked with.

60
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,600
-你说什么  -你让我
What? Leaving me

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,300
对付一个单手怪人
with the one-handed freak

62
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,570
和一个疯女人  你却和一群
and crazy bitch, while you hang out

63
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,830
-帅哥在一起  -闭嘴

64
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,570
-安静点  -别告诉我怎么做
Be quiet. Be quiet. Don't tell me what to do!

65
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,300
你是个懦夫
You're a coward!

66
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,700
听我说
Listen to me.

67
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,530
你以为格雷琴和巴格维尔会给你"锡拉"
You think Gretchen and Bagwell are gonna get you Scylla,

68
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,630
但他们的对手

69
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,430
早有准备

-你闭嘴  -不要命令我
You shut up! Okay,be quiet.Don't tell me to shut up.

什么都不要告诉他
Don't tell him anything!

73
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400

-你给我安静  -别命令我
Be quiet! Don't tell me

我们需要他
We needed him.

78

79

算了  去对付格雷琴和巴格维尔

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,270
科尔  你真该觉得脸红
Cole.you ought to be ashamed of youelf.

82
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,200
我不管你回家怎么做
I don't know how things worked back home,

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,630

看来你不喜欢久居一处  是吧
I guess you don't like to stay put much, do you?

100
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,330
天啊  我天生就是个好动之人

怎么得到五张卡的

不用太伤心嘛
The frustration must be killing you.

117
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,470
是它吗
Is that...?

118
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,630
那是什么
What is that?

119
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,370
那些卡都是钥匙
The cards were keys...

120
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,330
这个

这个才是锡拉
this is Scylla.

122
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,970
你现在应该
Guess right now you wish

123
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,670
后悔陷害我们了吧  将军
you'd framed somebody else, huh, General?

124
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,600
你们是出不去的
You're not even close to getting out of here.

125
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,070
我们走
Let's go.

126
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,030
哥们  你确定吗
You sure, Papi?

127
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,870
我们不知道原路返回会怎样
We have no idea what's waiting for us back there.

128
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,230
对  但我们也不知道往上走会怎样
Yeah, but we don't know what's be up there

129
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,670
相信我
either. Trust me.

130
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,730
将军  我们需要你
General, we're gonna need you

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,770

你得跟我们一起走
You're coming with us.

134
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,470
没事的  德曼尼  放下枪

一切尽在掌控之中
Everything's under control.

136
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,600
红色警报
We have a major situation.

迈克尔  谢天谢地
Michael, thank God.

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,330
我们搞定了
We got it.

139
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,370
你那边怎么样
How's it going on your end?

140
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,100
非常好
Pretty damn good.

141
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,300
再给我五分钟
But give me five more minutes.

142
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,500
你告诉怀特杀我儿子时
Is that the desk

143
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,870
就坐在这里吗
you sat at when you told Wyatt to kill my son?

144
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,770
放心吧  阿历克斯
Don't worry, Alex.

145
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,400
过了今天  他就不会再发号施令了
He won't be giving any more orders after today.

146
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,870
我很好奇
I'm curious.

147
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,170
你们认为你们能出去吗
How do you think you're getting out of here?

148
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,030
我们
The second

149
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,900
走出电梯时
we stepped off the elevator,

150
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,770
我的警卫就下令封锁了整幢大楼
my guard made a call to put the entire building under lockdown.

151
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,230
禁止一切出入
Nothing gets in or out.

152
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,430
不管你们在等什么
So whatever you're waiting for

153
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,370
都不会来了
it isn't coming.

154
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,130
你在看什么
What are you looking at, huh?

155
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,330
没有  什么都没有
Nothing. Nothing.

156
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,530
你在看什么
Huh? What are you looking at?!

157
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,700
什么都没有
Nothing.

158
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,470
别老瞪着我  回去
Don't you be eyeballing me, soldier.Back to work.

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,070
我们不可能搞定了
There's no way this is gonna end well.

160
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,230
我们应该离开这里
We should get out of here.

161
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,600
等20分钟赚1.25亿美金不值吗
Don't you think it's worth 20 minutes for $125 million?

162
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,500
闭嘴吧

163
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,330
派一队人守在在将军办公室外

164
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,430
我们必须解决这事

检查电梯
Check the elevator.

166
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,870
把守楼梯
Cover the stairwell.

167
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,300
设计这么多就为了保密一些姓名和报告吗
All that design just to hold some names and reports.

168
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,000
姓名和报告
Names and reports?

169
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,730
这是政府还是你父亲告诉你们的
Is that informatn from the government,or your father?

170
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,970
小心点
Careful.

171
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,870
右边最上层抽屉

172
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,100
有你感兴趣的东西
It's something that should be of interest to you.

173

174
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,730
你为什么离开
Why did you leave?

175
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
我在一个跨国集团
I took a position

176
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,830
找了一份工作
with a group of multinationals we call

177
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,400
我们称之为"公司"
the Company.

178
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,770
他们决定这个国家的一切
They call every shot this country takes.

179
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,670
你们出生前  我就认识你们父亲
I knew your father since before you were born

180
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,070
你们知道他曾为"公司"卖命
You do know he worked for the Company?

181
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,170
对  他是个数据分析家
Yeah. He was data analyst.

182
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,630
他是这样跟你说的吗
Is that what he told you?

183
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,330
也有道理
Well, it makes sense.

184
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,500
他想保护你们  远离真相
He wanteto protect you from the truth.

185
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,170
我警告你
I'm warning you.

186
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,400
你父亲是个聪明人
Your father was a brilliant man,

187
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,170
但他绝不可能击垮"公司"
but he could never have defeated the Company.

188
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,370
你们没必要像他一样
You don't have to make the same

189
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,200
犯愚蠢的致命错误
misguided, fatal mistake that he did.

190
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,930
你们对"公司"知之甚少
There's so much you don't know about the Company...

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,930
还有锡拉
about Scylla...

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,930
你父亲
about your dad...

193
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,930
还有你母亲
about your mother.

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,230
我发誓  我会杀了你
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

195
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,630
放松点
Let's get through this.

196
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,130
计划是什么
What's the plan?

197
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,430
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self?

198
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,570
进行如何
Where are we?

199
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,500
他们进去大约2个小时了
The men went in about two hours ago.

200
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,200
还不确定他们是否得到锡拉了吗
No confirmation on whether they've gotten Scylla?

201
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,970
还没有  不过我保证  贺勃
Not yet, but I promise you, Herb,

202
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,970
我第一个告诉你  好吧
you'll be the first to know, okay?

203
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,100
一旦得到消息  我会开一辆无牌车
And as soon as I get word, I'm taking an unmarked car

204
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,030
去接头点  然后我再回来
to the pickup location, and then I'm gonna head back over...

205
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,870
不  你直接去达洛斯议员办公室
No. You go directlyto Senator Dallow's office

206
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,330
我会让检察长在那等着
I'll have the attorney general standing by.

207
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,930
我们不能临时改变计划
We can't veer from the plan here.

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,170
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

209
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,300
明白

210
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,300
就快结束了
We're almost at the finish line.

212

我没想到你能查到这么深
I never thought you'd make it this far.

213
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,370
我错了
I was wrong.

214
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,170
我们要做好准备
We need to be prepared to go in

215
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,200
随时待命
as soon as the General gives the order.

216
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,830
你们想要什么
What is it you all want?

217
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,470

向我们撒点钱
throw some cash at us, huh?

我们就会忘掉一切吗
We'll forget everything, call it a day?

225

潘姆需要你  阿历克斯

226
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,500
此刻更是如此
Now more than ever.

为人父母  钱不在话下

现在声音多绝望

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,300
我想要的是
What I want

243
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,770

244

That'll never happen.

261
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,800
最后一次机会

262
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,130
把"锡拉"留下

只管从这扇门出去

你杀了我  然后呢

从19层高的办公室窗户跳下去吗

迈克尔  你杀了我就没了筹码

是我

274
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,200
丽莎

我在枪口上
I'm at gunpoint.

276
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,500
怎么回事
What's going on?

277
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,670

她说  你要是不让迈克尔
She says if you don't

279
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,400
和其他人带着"锡拉"离开  她就杀了我
let Michael and the others leave with Scylla, she'll kill me.

280
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,830
爸爸

将军  我建议你采纳你女儿的建议
I suggest you take your daughter's advice, General.

284
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,230
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

285
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,750
丽莎  你在哪
Lisa, where you are?

286
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,180
让她听电话
Get her back on the phone!

287
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,480
我们离开后你可以跟你女儿通话
You can talk to your daughter after we've left

288
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,050
当然  是带着"锡拉"一起离开
with Scylla, of course.

289
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,780
据说你女朋友
Look, I read enough intel on your girlfriend

290
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,920
连只苍蝇也不会杀
to know that she wouldn't hurt a fly.

291
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,150
3个月前还有可能
Maybe three months ago.

292
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,720
但现在她变了
but she's changed.

293
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,050
我们都变了
We've all changed.

294
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,280
这是你杀的所有人的名单
This is a list of everyone you've killed.

295
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,520
父辈  子女  朋友
Fathers, sons, friends.

296
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,780
你真的认为
Do you really think

297
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,880
你女儿的性命比他们的值钱吗
your daughter's life is worth any more than theirs?

298
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,720
现在只有两个选择
One of two things is going to happen now.

299
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,580
放我们走  或者牺牲丽莎
You're going to let us go, or Lisa will die.

300
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,880
任选其一
Either one is fine with me.

301
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,350
不要伤害她
Just don't hurt her.

302
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,580
只要你信守诺言  我们就不伤人
As long as you hold up your end of the deal, we won't.

303
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,520
你下过令要转移"锡拉"
You ordered Scylla to be moved.

304
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,750
让我们体验一下吧
Show us how.

305
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,350
我跟他们出去
I'm walking them out!

306
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,620
退后
Stand down.

307
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,050
退后
Stand down.

308
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,450
是  长官
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,720
他们肯定找到另外的出路
They must have found another way out.

310
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,580
不可能  那他们就被抓住或者死了
That's impossible. Well, then, they're caught or dead.

311
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,580
我们还要等多久
How much longer are we gonna wait?

312
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,820
是你说斯科菲尔德已经计划好了
You were the one who said Scofield had a plan.

313
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,620
是你用枪指着怀特先生
And you put a gun in Mr. White's face!

314
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,620
他会报警的
He was going to call the police.

315
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,280
别出声  没事的  我是联邦探员

319
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,080
我盯着科尔和那个女人

320
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,820
你们一次两个人溜出去

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,280
为什么不能一起走
Why can't we all go together?

你在这儿  去抓他们
You're here. Go arrest them.

324

我想在他们发现之前
I want to get out as many of you as possible

325
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,580
尽可能多的救你们出去
before they realize what's happening.

326
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,150
帝博格・巴格维尔因谋杀被通辑

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,020
你得一辈子逃命
You're gonna run for your life,

330
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,380
你个白痴
you idiot.

331
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,180

感觉如何
How does it feel, huh?

338
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,580
被迫做不想做的事
Being forced to do something you don't want to do?

339
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,450
但如果你不照做
But knowing that if you don't go through with it,

340
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,320
你关心的人就会遭殃
someone you care about is gonna suffer;

341
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,450
他们会付出代价
they're gonna pay?

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,720
种什么因  得什么果  将军
What goes around, comes around, huh, General?

343

我无法想象你经历的事
I can't imagine what you've been through.

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,780
我无法想象你想做的事
I can't imagine that you'd want to.

346
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,850
不论他们对你做了什么
Whatever they've done to you...

347
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
你就是他们  我的朋友
"They" are you, my friend.

348

不论他们跟你说了什么
Whatever they've told you,

349
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,750

斯科菲尔德和布伦斯是坏人
Scofield and Burws are bad men.

351

他们让你用枪指着一个无辜的女人

你是无辜的

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,150
你只是
You're jus..

357

处理数据
crunching numbers and running data

358
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,280
让世界变得更美好

359
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,050
德巴克夫人
Mrs. Tabak?

360
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,650

You're fine.

361
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,380
你还需要几分钟

370
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,380
而底下的人都要死了
Down on the ground, men and women are dying

371
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,580

那样的话  我就能

坐在办公桌后吗

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,020
你以为你还能坚持多久

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,920
你想拿着MP-5上大街上吗

383
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,920
你不是认真的吧
You can't be serious.

384

他们能认出你  科尔

你是唯一把我跟绑架联系起来的人

温柔点  甜心

也没人跟踪
with nobody trailing us.

398
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,150
公司的探员不只深入到联调局

你永远看不到我们在哪
You'll never see us coming.

402
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,150
实际上  一旦我们把"锡拉"交给正确的人
Actually, once we get Scylla into the right hands,

403
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,250
你所有的探员和行动

404
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,450
都会公之于众
it'll all be out in the open,

405
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,980

想知道你父亲替公司干过什么吗

410
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,480
他是个刽子手

他杀掉所有背叛公司的人
He killed people who defected from the company.

412
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,950
而他训练的人会追杀你们
now the men he trained will be coming after you.

413
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,750
跟我来  有点不对劲
Come on. Something's not right.

414
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,920
德巴克女士
Mrs. Tabak?

415
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,980
德巴克女士
Mrs. Tabak?!

416
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,220
她刚走
She just left.

417
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,480
唐克雷蒂  她肯定没走远
Tancredi.she has to be right outside.

418
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,580
你还好吗
Are you all right?

419
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,980
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

420
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,020

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,520
不  我要你待在安全的地方
No. I want you in a secure location,

422
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,880
有人监护你
under supervision.

423
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,950
你先回家
You go home.

424
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,280
但我必须过去
But I really need to be there.

425
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,820
我们一拿回"锡拉"  就给你打电话
I'll call you once we get Scylla back

426
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,380
我们把那辆卡车的牌照和识别码
We've given the truck's license plate and VIN number

427
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,620
报给当地警局了
to the local police...

428
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,950
一旦斯科菲尔德破解出标准操作程序
We lost our tactical initiative the minute

429
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,880
我们就失去了战术主动权
that Scoeld figured out our SOPs.

430
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,720
我们要打败他
If we want to defeat him,

431
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,520
就必须打破陈规  出其不意
we've got to alter our way operating become unpredictable.

432

是他们  迈克尔  你们在哪

446
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,480

471
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,220
在这么多人面前吗
In front of all these people?

472
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,380
你们不敢这么张扬的
You'd never risk that kind of exposure.

473
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,550
我觉得现在已经很明朗了
I think it's clear by now

474
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,880
你错误估计我们的限度了
that you've miscalculated how far we're willing to go.

475
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,520
把包给我
Give me the bag.

476
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,090
马上就把包给我
Give me the bag. Now.

477
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,260
告诉克兰兹事情还没完
Tell Krantz this isn't finished.

478
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,620
你可以亲自告诉他
Oh, you can tell him in person.

479
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,720
先生  请跟我们来
Sir? Please come with us.

480
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,320
怎么了
Excuse me?

481
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,920
安全检查而已
Just a security precaution.

482
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,520
好吧  没问题
Yeah, sure.

483
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,460
真的有必要吗
Is this really necessary?

484
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,290
请把包里的东西都拿出来
Please empty the contents of your bag.

485
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,160
我包里就一台电脑
Look, all I've got in there is a laptop

486
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,490
和一个外接硬盘而已
and an external hard drive.

487
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,990
告诉你  你们抓错人了
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy.

488
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,820
先生  放开包
Let go of the bag, sir.

489
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,360
[善终为善]
All's well that ends well.

490
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,860
如何
Well?

491
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,090
我们拿着呢
Yeah, we got it.

492
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,590
这么说你一开始就知道我是谁
So you knew who I was from the start, huh?

493
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,560
我的真实姓名  我的记录
My real name, my record...

494
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,960
我看过你的档案  没错
I read your file, yeah.

495
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,620
如果你没看过呢
What if you hadn't?

496
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,220
你想说什么
What's your point?

497
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,060
如果你不知道
What if you never knew

498
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,260
我是杀人犯帝博格・巴格维尔呢
I was Theodore Bagwell, the convict?

499
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,620
你会不会相信我是科尔・普发
Would you have believed I was Cole Pfeiffer?

500
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,420
顶级销售员
Stellar salesman...

501
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,560
天才演说家
talented speaker?

502
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,690
不知道
I don't know.

503
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,920
但你确实骗了不少人
You certainly had a lot of other people fooled, though.

504
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,260
在你拿枪指着他们之前
Till you pled a machine gun on them.

505
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,260
我想这就像是他们在伽特所说的
I guess it's like they said over at GATE:

506
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,660
我们都是自我的俘虏
"We are captives of our own identities,

507
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,690
禁锢在自己创造的监狱里
living in prisons of our own creation."

508
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,960
谁会想到此话
Who would've thought they'd actually

509
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,990
一语中的
be right about something?

510
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,360
你要是把它弄丢了
So if you drop this,

511
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,260
我们是不是都得回监狱
does that mean we all go back to prison?

512
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,720
别担心
Don't worry.

513
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,290
要是让它落入坏人手中
If this doesn't get in the right hands in one piece,

514
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,820
我的处境也会跟你们一样
I'm going to be in as bad a spot as you are.

515
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,190
恭喜你们
Congratulations.

516
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,360
怎样
What now?

517
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,320
我要遵守我之前的承诺
Now, I live up to my end of the deal.

518
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,290
半小时后  有辆车会来接你们
The vans are going to be here in a half an hour.

519
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,020
去驻外办事处
They're going to be sent to a field office

520
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,920
按程序搞掂一切
where you can go through processing.

521
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,490
这是你们的迁移文件
Th is all your transfer papework.

522
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,490
拿这个去找施密特探员
Get this to an Agent Schmidt.

523
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,020
他会护送你们安全离开
He's going to be heading up the convoy.

524
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,690
我很想亲自送你们
I wish I could drive you myself,

525
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,890
但我得尽快赶到达洛斯那边去
but I need to get to Dallow ASAP.

526
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,120
你还好吗
Are you okay?

527
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,120
还好
Yeah, I'm okay.

528
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,120
不  他不好
No, he's not.

529
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,660
他需要去医院
He needs to go to a hospital.

530
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,190
我再安排一辆救护车过来
All right, I'm going to send an ambulance with the vans.

531
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,660
给你安排最好的医疗救治
You're going to get the best medical care available.

532
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,660
谢谢你
Thank you.

533
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,860
不  应该感谢你们才对
No, I should be thanking you.

534
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,220
由于你们的功劳
Okay, because of what you've done,

535
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,260
生活将从此改变
lives are going to be changed forever.

536
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,690
再安排一辆救护车一起过来
Listen, I need a, uh, ambulance to come with the convoy.

537
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,760
长官  下一步怎么办
Sir, what are your orders?

538
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,660
长官
Sir?

539
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,620
我不知道
I don't know.

540
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,620
我们再也没有后顾之忧了
None of us will ever have to look over our shoulders again.

541
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,350
这是最重要的
That's the most important thing.

542
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,180
不管将来如何
No matter what comes next.

543
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,220
迈克尔  你不会有事的
You're gonna make it, Michael.

544
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,950
你做完手术
You'll have the operation and,

545
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,080
就会好起来的
and you'll get through this.

546
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,850
就像我们这一路走来一样
Just like we've gotten through everything else.

547
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,350
她很担心你
She's worried about you.

548
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,680
我很开心下一次想喝酒的时候
It's nice to know that the next time I want to drink one of these,

549
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,150
不用在这破仓库里喝
I won't have to drink it in this crappy warehouse.

550
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,520
没错
Yeah.

551
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,650
我都不记得上次坐在餐厅或去打球
I can't even remember being able to sit down at a restaurant

552
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,050
是什么感觉了
or go to a ball game.

553
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,680
天啊  就像这辈子都在逃亡
God... it seems like I've been running forever.

554
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,750
现在该停下来
But time to stand still.

555
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,780
好好享受了
Take in the sun.

556
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,520
干杯
Salud.

557
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,650
我知道现在应该开心才对
I know I'm supposed to be happy right now.

558
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,350
但我还是很害怕
I'm still scared.

559
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
我害怕经历过这么多
I'm scared we're going to have come all this way

560
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,680
我还会失去你
and I'm going to lose you anyway.

561
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,850
过来
Come here.

562
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,350
过来
Come on.

563
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,750
莎拉
Sara...

564
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,080
别跟我说
Just don't tell me

565
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,580
一切都会好起来
that everything's going to be okay, please.

566
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,620
好的
Okay.

567
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,920
我不会说的
I won't.

568
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,920
你把你的"朋友"带来了
I see you brought your friend along.

569
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,780
格雷琴呢
What happened to Gretchen?

570
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,380
她跑了
Uh, she got away.

571
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,450
就是这个
So here it is.

572
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,880
什么
Wha...?

573
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,850
天啊
Oh, my God.

574
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,020
简直不敢相信
Wow. I can't believe it

575
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,420
接下来呢
So what's next?

576
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,050
找达洛斯议员
Senator Dallow?

577
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,050
不  我还需要处理一些琐事
No, I need to tie up some loose ends.

578
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,680
格雷琴和巴格维尔提过"锡拉"的其他事吗
Did Gretchen and Bagwell say anything else about Scylla

579
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,780
-例如其他买主  -冯
in terms of other buyers? Feng.

580
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,080
他已经死了
He's dead.

581
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,820
他们没和其他人说过吗
They didn't talk to anyone else?

582
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,250
我们要尽量搜集证据
We need to get as many indictments

583
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,480
指控他们
on this thing as possible.

584
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,980
巴格维尔可能知道
Well, Bagwell might know.

585
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,320
只要在审问时给他点甜头
Once we get him in an interview room and offer him a deal,

586
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,780
他就会说的
his mouth will start moving.

587
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,420
还记得我们来的第一天我说的话吗
Remember what I said to you the first day we got here?

588
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,450
记得  你说等这一切结束了
Yeah, you said that when this was over,

589
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,120
我们再做个了断
we were gonna settle up.

590
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,780
我们已经两清了
We're settled.

591
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,620
迈克尔
Michael.

592
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,880
都一个小时了
It's been an hour.

593
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,120
你能给赛尔夫打电话看救护车什么时候来吗
Would you call Self and check on that ambulance?

594
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,450
他不接电话吗
Is he not picking up?

595
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,820
可能是信号不好
Maybe something's wrong with the signal.

596
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,480
你所拨打的电话不在服务区
The number you have reached is not in service at this time

597
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,350
此号码为空号
and there is no new number.

598
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,020
怎么了
What is it?

599
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,220
你做的很好  米里亚姆
You did really good on this one, Miriam.

600
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,750
你很坚强
You really held your own.

601
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,550
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

602
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,680
我能仔细看看那东西吗
Can I take a closer look at that?

603
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,720
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,720
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

605
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,950
赛尔夫
Self.

606
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,720
赛尔夫
Self.
