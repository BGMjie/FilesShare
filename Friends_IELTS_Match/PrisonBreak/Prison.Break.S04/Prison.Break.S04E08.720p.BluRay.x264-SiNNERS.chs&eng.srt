00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,000
《越狱》  前情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,160
如果"锡拉"是一张饼  我们只拿到其中一块
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got is a slice.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,930
"锡拉"不是一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,430
是六张
It's six.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,800
这事发生多久了
How long has  it been happening?

7
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,860
这不是大问题
It's not a big deal.

8
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,960
你13岁的时候  就已是个大问题了
It was a big deal when you were 13.

9
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,560
迈克尔和你说过妈的事吗
Michael told you about Mom?

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,400
-没有  -她小时候经常流鼻血
No. As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

11
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,630
她30多岁时  又开始流鼻血
In her 30s, they started up again.

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,130
你母亲什么时候去世的
How old was your mom when she passed away?

13
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,100
31岁  迈克尔也刚好31岁
31. Michael's just turning 31.

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,700
那个人是谁
Who's that?

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,860
他就是杀我儿子的凶手
That's the man that killed my son.

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,230
他就象个数码黑洞
It's like a digital black hole.

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,760
能接收10英尺内的所有电子数据
It swallows up any electronic data within ten feet.

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,330
格兰先生
Mr. Glenn?

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,800
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

20
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,130
那是干什么用的
What's that do?

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,540
是个电子游戏机的
It's a battery pack

22
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,330
电池组
for a video game console.

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,100
那你只能买个新的了
You'll need to buy a new one.

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,230
锡拉  明天给我的话
Scylla. Get it to me by tomorrow

25
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,300
你就能拿原来报酬的一半
and you will receive 50% of the fee.

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,160
后天  四分之一
Two days, 25%.

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,730
大后天
Three days,

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,000
我让你脑袋开花
I shoot you through the brain.

29
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,660
你是谁
Who is this?

30
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,660
你好  迈克尔
Hello, Michael.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,460
你明白吧
You know what?

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,300
如果格莱布再给我找这样的烂活
If Crab ever throws a psycho at us like this again,

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,000
我就宰了他
I'm going to kill him.

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,530
对  但是我们如果不干的话  格莱布会宰了我们
Yeah, but if we don't get this psycho, Crab's going to kill us.

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,000
把枪准备好
Just have the burner ready.

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,830
准备好了
Got it covered.

37
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,430
做完这个之后  我就洗手不干了
After this job, I'm done, man.

38
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,160
我不能再做下去了
I can't do this anymore.

39
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,030
你觉得格莱布会怎么说
What do you think Crab will say about that?

40
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,200
我不管他说什么
I don't care what Crab says about that.

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,130
如果进监狱的话  我还怎么做个好父亲
How can I be a good father if I'm always in prison?

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,700
我错过了我孩子的童年
I missed out on my kid's childhood.

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,630
我不能再错过他成长的过程
I'm not going to miss out on him becoming a man.

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,460
说实话  就算是你干  这个计划也太大胆了
You know, not for nothing, but this plan is crazy even for you.

45
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,030
你确定这是唯一办法
You sure this is the only way?

46
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,200
没错
Yeah.

47
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,830
快看  他出来了
Hey look. He's coming out.

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,830
他带着箱子
He's got the case.

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,030
系好安全带
Let's buckle up.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,730
把手举起来  把手举起来
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,100
别客气
You're welcome.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,230
快闪
Let's go!

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,260
等等  这就是你的好主意
So wait a minute. This is your brilliant plan?

54
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,860
你打算用自杀的方法去撞将军的车
You're going to pull a kamikaze mission on the General's car?

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,400
你的仪器已经没了
Now that the device is gone,

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,200
你的意见也就不重要了
your opinion doesn't matter.

57
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,800
闭嘴  加你的油
So shut up and pump.

58
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,530
我们知道将军总是轻装行动
We know the General travels light.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,230
一辆轿车  几个保镖
One limo and a couple of guards.

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,860
我不担心那几个保镖  我担心的是撞车
It ain't the guards I'm worried about; it's the crash.

61
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,600
我没说过这会很轻松
Look, I never said this was going to be easy.

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,900
别激动
Just relax.

63
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,660
首先  巴拿马的事是公事公办
First off, Panama was a job.

64
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,060
日后再算账
Some other time.

65
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,300
你要“锡拉“做什么
What do you want with Scylla?

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
那是我自己的事
That's my business.

67
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,900
我们不是在巴拿马
We're not in Panama anymore,

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,230
我也不在监狱里  我再问一次
and I'm not behind a fence, so, again,

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,730
你要“锡拉”做什么
what do you want with Scylla?

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,030
和你一样  打垮公司
Same thing you want: bring down the Company.

71
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,530
很好  那你何不
Great. Then why don't you

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,360
把缺的几页纸给我  然后消失呢
give me those missing pages and disappear?

73
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,230
我很想那么做  你记得那天
I'd love to. You remember that day

74
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,460
我们在罗斯福酒店  惠斯勒复制了Lief的卡
at the Roosevelt when Whistler made off with Lief's card?

75
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,630
你觉得是谁的主意
Who do you think took the fall for that?

76
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,160
我们的名字都在同一张黑名单里
Our names are at the top of the same hit list.

77
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,330
我不知道你们有什么协议
Now, I don't know what arrangement you two have,

78
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,800
我需要一些资金
but I need some traveling money.

79
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,030
我们过会再谈这个
Let's talk about that later.

80
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,330
我们干嘛不谈谈你是在给
Why don't we talk about the kind of scum

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,900
什么样的烂人付钱
you're willing to put on the payroll?

82
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,860
告诉我一个用不到她的理由  我听你的
Give me a way to do it without her, and we'll do it.

83
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,330
我们需要那些纸
We need the pages.

84
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,200
这是个交易
It's a package deal.

85
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,030
我们是拍档了吗
Are we partners?

86
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,030
拍档
Partners.

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,230
我刚刚往机器里投了一个币
Look, I barely dropped a nickel in the slots, right?

88
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
那人就过来了
This guy was all...

89
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,630
我们真应该打死你
We ought to blanket party your ass.

90
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,560
那个仪器呢
Where's the device?

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,700
-能不能拿回来  -快说
Can it be salvaged? Tell him.

92
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,400
赌台老板把它收走了
Pit boss walked off with it.

93
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,030
那好  我们只能让你提前退休了
Okay. Well, we're going to call this your early retirement.

94
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,560
你要么上楼
You can either go upstairs

95
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,200
坐在你的小床上  等我们把事情解决
and sit on your cot and ride out the rest of this thing,

96
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,560
否则  我就给赛尔夫探员打电话
or I can call Agent Self

97
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,700
那你就能慢慢享受刑期了
and you can ride out the rest of your prison sentence.

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,400
你选吧
Your choice.

99
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,930
我要和你谈谈
I need to talk to you.

100
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,360
你哥哥说了你流鼻血的事
So your brother told me about your nosebleeds.

101
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,880
他还说了你妈妈的情况
And he told me about your mom.

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,530
那不是他该做的
That wasn't his place.

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,430
为你担心
To be worried about you?

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,030
妈妈得病时  林肯每天都在医院  握着她的手
When Mom got sick, Linc was at the hospital every day, holding her hand,

105
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,760
看着妈妈去世  他那时才13岁
watching her die, and he was 13.

106
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,030
这件事改变了他  让他对任何事都过头担心
It changed him. It made him overprotective.

107
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,030
现在他开始
And now he's jumping

108
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,130
用错误的原因
to all the wrong conclusions

109
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
得出错误的结论
for all the wrong reasons,

110
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,200
而且都无中生有的
and it's... it's over nothing because

111
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,900
我很好
I'm fine.

112
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,730
你看起来可不好
You don't look fine.

113
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,710
因为我也有些事情要告诉你
Well, maybe that's because there's something I have to tell you.

114
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,700
格雷琴还活着
Gretchen's alive.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,330
她和帝博格一起合作
She's working with T-Bag,

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
他们有几张惠斯勒的鸟类书页
and they have several pages from Whistler's bird book,

117
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,830
他们也想加入找锡拉
and they want in on Scylla.

118
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,830
我们说话的同时  赛尔夫正和他们谈条件
Self is cutting them a deal as we speak.

119
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,060
赛尔夫知道他们有自己的计划
Self knows that they have their own agenda,

120
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,500
但我们也有
but so do we

121
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,400
只要我们拿到那几页纸
and as soon as we get those pages back,

122
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,600
格雷琴和帝博格就会为他们做的事付出代价
Gretchen and T-Bag are going to pay for everything.

123
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,730
他们会得到应有的惩罚
They're going to get exactly what's coming to them.

124
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,060
整件事情和格雷琴无关
This isn't about Gretchen.

125
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,830
也不会牵扯私人恩怨
It's not about any one person.

126
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,230
我们必须结束这一切
And we... we have to finish it.

127
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,130
我想自己呆一会
I need a minute.

128
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,230
可以吗
Please.

129
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,460
我绝对不相信
I can't believe this!

130
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,830
我们有其他选择吗
What choice do we have?

131
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,260
格雷琴加入我们
Gretchen's on the team.

132
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,460
不管喜不喜欢
Like it or not,

133
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,100
我们需要那几页纸
we need those pages.

134
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
我们要和这婊子[西班牙语]合作
Another perra we're jumping in bed with?

135
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,460
对我们来说不是第一次了
Not exactly new territory for us.

136
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,100
我不管我们要和谁合作
I don't care who we gotta partner up with.

137
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,360
我们拿到那些纸  就才可以打入"公司"
We get those papers, we make with the break-in,

138
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,830
就能完成任务
we get this job done.

139
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,860
她也可能和"公司"还有联系  我不确定
She could still have ties to the Company, man. I don't know.

140
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,600
到时候  我们再担心格雷琴
We'll worry about Gretchen when the time is right.

141
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,400
现在  我们要集中在将军身上
For now, let's focus on the General.

142
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,030
格雷琴加入我们也改变不了什么
This thing with Gretchen doesn't change a thing.

143
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,800
我们
We're, uh...

144
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,530
我们还是接近目标
we're still close.

145
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,460
更接近"锡拉"  离怀特却更远了
Closer to Scylla, farther from Wyatt.

146
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,930
这也说不准
You don't know that.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,300
先集中精力  好吗
Just stay focused, all right?

148
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,260
这才是我要集中精力的地方
This is my focus, okay?

149
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,460
我还是做我该做的事
I'm doing the job, okay? All right? All right?

150
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,500
每一天  杀我儿子的凶手就离我更远
Every day, the trail to my son's killer gets a little bit colder.

151
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,030
我能做的就只有集中精力
That's all I do is focus.

152
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,030
你在干什么
What are you doing?

153
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,230
只是
Um... It's just... uh...

154
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,530
我们要把电脑拿楼下用
We're going to need that downstairs.

155
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,400
那我就呆在这好了
Yeah. I'll just, uh... be up here.

156
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,600
多少钱换斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
How much for Scofield and Burrows?

157
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,920
我听说你们俩有了个协议
I see you two have come to an agreement.

158
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,150
放了她 是因为她要工作
She's on work release,

159
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,580
和你一样
just like you.

160
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,150
什么样的工作
What kind of work?

161
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,820
你和那个秘书在办公室里保守秘密
You and the secretary keep things quiet in the office

162
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,420
迈克尔从隧道去找"锡拉"
while Michael tunnels to Scylla.

163
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,480
你真的以为
You really think

164
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,650
斯科菲尔德会遵守他的诺言
Scofield's gonna keep his word, huh?

165
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,650
你把他爱的女人往死里打
You horsewhipped the woman he loves.

166
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,820
迈克尔和我们一样想得到“锡拉”
Michael wants Scylla just as badly as we do.

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,550
没错  他当时也想逃出监狱
Yeah, he wanted out of prison, too.

168
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,180
我们的合作在那之后就结束了
Our partnership lasted long enough for that to happen,

169
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,980
然后  我们就分道扬镳了
and then...  we parted ways.

170
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,880
相信我
Trust me.

171
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,980
先生  请进
Yeah, um, go on in, sir.

172
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,350
斯科菲尔德会利用你
Scofield will use you

173
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,220
为了给他女朋友报仇  他会在你背后来一刀
and then he's gonna bury the knife in your back for what you did to his lady friend.

174
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,820
"锡拉"在哪
Where's Scylla?

175
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,350
早上好  先生
Good morning to you, too, sir.

176
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,350
先生们
Gentlemen.

177
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,150
我给了你3天
I gave you three days.

178
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,680
"锡拉"在哪
Where's Scylla?

179
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,580
我
I...

180
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:44,320
冯先生  别急着下结论
Now, uh, Mr. Feng, let's not do anything rash.

181
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,220
你就是冯
So you're Feng.

182
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,320
我们还没见过面
We haven't actually met in person.

183
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,420
我就是"斑蛇行动"中
I was the liaison between the Company and your

184
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,720
你的雇主和"公司"之间的联络人
Chinese employers on Operation Copperhead.

185
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,320
苏珊
Susan?

186
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,350
没错
That's right.

187
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,180
你从为"公司"卖命
You went from working for the Company

188
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,250
转变为盗取能摧毁他们的证据
to stealing the one thing that could destroy them.

189
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,080
这个转变未免太突然了
That's a tight turn.

190
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,150
从"锡拉"的价格来看
With a price that Scylla commands on the open market,

191
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,150
任何人都会变
anybody would turn.

192
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,280
顺便说一下  值200吧
Which is, by the way, 200.

193
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,080
我们在行动中没有合作过
Our paths never crossed on Copperhead,

194
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,350
但是我确实和你的一个同事合作过
but I did deal with one of your colleagues;

195
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,050
一个不太能干的中间人
a less-capable associate.

196
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,120
他怎么了
Whatever happened to him?

197
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,250
他已经从这个世界消失了
He was skinned and hung from an overpass.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,850
我想起来了
Oh, yes, I recall.

199
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,420
他没有在保证的时间内把东西送到
He couldn't deliver on promises made.

200
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,080
你也可能会想起  他是我的前任
You may also recall that he was my predecessor.

201
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,180
我参加行动后  你得到了你想要的
When I joined Copperhead, you got what you wanted.

202
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,520
我也会得到"锡拉"
You'll get Scylla, too.

203
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,350
如果我拿不到
If I don't,

204
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,780
我就扒了你的皮
I'll peel you like a wet grape.

205
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,220
报酬是100
And the price is 100.

206
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,580
150.

207
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,820
125  别让我失望
125. Don't disappoint me.

208
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,380
你们说的  125
Well, 125...

209
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,150
再乘1百万
Million.

210
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,920
苏珊  格雷琴  不管你名字是什么
Susan, Gretchen, whatever your name is,

211
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,320
我建议你赶快找个方法
I suggest you find a way to bury the hatchet

212
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,820
和迈克尔・斯科菲尔德的女人和解
with Michael Scofield's woman.

213
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,980
我们有的忙了
We got work to do.

214
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,120
我怎么觉得有人早上起来
Why do I get the feeling that some poor bastard woke up

215
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,450
会发现自己的车没了
to an empty driveway this morning?

216
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,450
放松  我们从回收厂找来的
Relax, we got it from a scrap yard.

217
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,250
你们准备就寄望于
And you're pinning the hopes

218
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,980
这堆废铁吗
of the entire mission on that relic?

219
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,520
如果是第一张卡  我不会这么做
If it was card one, I'd say no.

220
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,680
如果是第五张
If this was card five,

221
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,980
我也不会这么做  但这是最后一张
I'd say no, but it's the last card.

222
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,620
我觉得可以假装肇事逃逸
I really think we can stage a hit-and-run

223
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,850
没有人会关注这件事
and get away with it.

224
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,080
好吧  我们知道他在哪上班
All right, we know where this guy works.

225
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,920
我们也知道他的路线
We know his route.

226
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,350
我会在这个十字路口等他
I'm gonna wait for him at this intersection.

227
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,180
他开过来
He drives through.

228
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,780
我开车撞他  拿到卡
I smash him with my car, get the card.

229
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,320
如果你能奇迹般活着离开现场
And if by some miracle you walked away from the crash,

230
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,950
将军就会知道是你偷了卡
the General's gonna know that you ripped him off.

231
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,880
除非我先给他打一针吗啡
Not if I pump him full of morphine first.

232
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,880
将军会第二天在医院醒过来
The General's gonna wake up tomorrow morning in the hospital

233
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,150
一点也不记得到底发生了什么事情
feeling happy as a clam with no idea what happened to him.

234
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,620
当他不省人事的时候
When he's out cold,

235
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,120
我们把卡下载到手提电脑里
we download the card onto the laptop

236
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,550
再把原卡放回去
and put the original back on him.

237
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,420
你以为救护人员来了
And you don't think this is gonna look suspicious

238
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,280
不会怀疑吗
for the paramedics that show up at the scene?

239
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,480
那就要看急救人员是谁了
That depends on who the paramedics are.

240
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,150
现在有四辆救护车
At the federal impound lot downtown,

241
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,850
因走私药品
there are currently four ambulances seized

242
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,050
被扣押在市中心的车管所
in a drug-smuggling ring.

243
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,180
我们只需要一辆
All we need is one.

244
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,880
你去搞定吧
Go make yourself useful.

245
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,960
指挥官会在作战前集结军队
Time was commanders would assemble their troops

246
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,390
并在方形土阵中做排练
before a battle and rehearse schemes of maneuver

247
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,260
用石头代指敌方地点
on a square of dirt using rocks to depict enemy positions.

248
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,890
他们称之为  "划石作战"
They called these rehearsals "rock drills."

249
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,420
老挝就是我们的石头  现在...
Laos was our rock drill. Now...

250
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,990
现在已经箭在弦上了
it's time for the battle to commence.

251
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
格里芬
Griffin.

252
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,120
用伪钞冲刷老挝市场
Flooding the Laotian market with counterfeit kip

253
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,020
非常有效
was highly effective.

254
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,160
到第二阶段  影响将继续扩大
In Phase Two, the effect will take longer,

255
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,490
但结果必然如出一辙
but the result will inevitably be the same.

256
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,890
我正在停止该命令
I'm signing off on the order to open up

257
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,460
以打开下一战区
the next theater of operations.

258
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,790
失陪
Excuse me.

259
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,990
信息来源很难摸透
The message is untraceable.

260
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,590
某人花了很多功夫
Someone went to a lot of trouble

261
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,120
去掩盖他们的踪迹
to cover their tracks.

262
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,360
你怎么知道此人能帮我们找到这两兄弟
How do we know this person can deliver the brothers?

263
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,990
我们不知道
We don't.

264
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,790
引蛇出洞
Bait the hook.

265
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,760
看他会不会上钩
See if he bites.

266
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,160
你好  朋友
Hey-hey, my friend!

267
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,060
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

268
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,920
唐・赛尔夫  国土安全局的
Don Self, Homeland Security.

269
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,020

00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,520
最近怎么样 不错
How's it going? Good.

271
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,690
这可是好东西
This is a grande.

272
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,390
这东西花了我9美金
This thing cost me nine bucks.

273
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,190
正和你加州口味  还有你的极品咖啡
You California types and your gourmet coffee.

274
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,020
我能为你做些什么
Hey, can I help you with something?

275
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,390
这是市车管所  对吗
This is a federal impound lot, correct?

276
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,290
没错
Yeah.

277
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,060
我的意图很明显  菲尔  我需要一辆车
Okay, I think it's pretty obvious, Phil, I need a car.

278
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,990
你告诉莎拉我流鼻血的事
So you told Sara about the nosebleeds, huh?

279
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
我很担心你
I'm worried about you.

280
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,020
你为什么
Well, why don't you stop

281
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,490
哪壶不开提哪壶
starting fires that I have to put out?

282
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
妈妈都没能逃脱病魔  你以为你...
Mom couldn't outrun this. What makes you think you...?

283
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,860
这和妈妈的情况不一样  那是20年前的事
It's not Mom, all right? That was 20 years ago.

284
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,260
这不一样  完全不一样
This is different. It's totally different.

285
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,820
上车
Get in.

286
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,760
我的头头来视察菜鸟们的宿舍
So my section chief comes over to the rookie's stretcher

287
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,460
然后他说  你们的补贴还真不少啊  孩子
and he goes, "You got one hell of a workman's comp claim, kid."

288
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,690
兄弟 我们说正事吧
Hey, uh, let's get that trip ticket started.

289
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,920
看来我能帮你
Looks like I can hook you up

290
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,390
弄辆轿车
with a sedan for your stakeout.

291
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,760
菲尔  我得走了
You know what, Phil? I gotta go.

292
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,920
说什么呢
What are you talking about?

293
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,220
我刚想起来
I just remembered.

294
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,860
我还得给上头们交份文件
I got to give a briefing to a bunch of higher-ups.

295
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,360
我还能回来
Can I come back

296
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,590
再拿车吗
for the sedan?

297
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,720
随你便  赛尔夫
Suit yourself, Self.

298
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,720

我要你帮我传个口信
I need you to deliver a message.

301
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,160
好
Okay.

302
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,320
看来你男朋友不用再享受
I see your boyfriend's no longer sporting

303
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,220
最新的全球定位科技了
the latest fashion in GPS technology.

304
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,090
既然你们都不用戴脚踝监视器

你们应该从这里到墨西哥

去享受逃往的性爱

你只要帮我把他弄上轮床

他直接冲过来  我们中埋伏了

你是说他们知道我们会去那

424
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,920
-那他们也知道这地方了  -我也这么说
Then they know about this place. That's exactly what I'm saying.

-布拉德  我要纱布  -随时会有人过来的
Brad, I'm gonna need some gauze. Somebody could be coming here right now.

426

如果他们知道这地方  那我们早就死了
If they knew about this place, we'd already be dead.

427
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,950
那个格雷琴呢
What about that Gretchen chick?

428
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,890
她有惠斯勒的几张书页
She's got a couple of pages from Whistler's bird book.

429
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,890

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,090
你们起初是排斥我
Okay, first you give me the leper treatment,

436
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,120
现在又说我是告密者

439
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,620
-要去那个交叉口  -告诉你
at that intersection? You know what, just because

440
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,290
别因为我没跟你们一起行动  就说我是告密者
I didn't do time with you guys, it doesn't make me a rat.

441
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,250
对此我的投入
All right? I put just as much into this job

442
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,290
不比任何人少

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,490
就算我犯了个小错
Okay, I make one little mistake

444
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,650
我就成犹大了吗
and all of a sudden I'm Judas?

445
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,220
不  算了
No, you know what? You know, no.

446
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,820
打电话给Self  我回
Call Self, okay, because... because I'm gonna go back

447

我要外部装有安全摄像的
I need the ones with exterior security cameras,

453
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,850
因为我要查个车牌号
'cause I'm looking for a license plate number,

454
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,590
好吗
all right?

455
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,720
为什么不道歉
How about an apology?

456
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,920
斯科菲尔德去哪了
Where the hell is Scofield?

457
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,650
我们全等着他破土动工
We've been waiting for him to break ground all day.

458

他还要处理最后一件事
He's taking care of one last thing.

459
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,820
早上他会来找你
He'll be here in the morning.

460
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,820
莎拉呢  她对会面作何回应
And Sara, what'd she say about our meeting?

461
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,890
她说没兴趣
She's not interested.

462
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,550
行  如果她改变注意  我会在那等她
Okay, well, if she changes her mind, I'll be there.

463
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,090
只想让大家都知道
Just so everyone knows,

464
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,650
这是莎拉做了结的最后机会
this is Sara's last chance to settle up.

465
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,150
我想让大家开诚布公
I want all the grievances out on the table

466
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,190
这样我们才能继续合作
so we can move forward.

467
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,190
听清楚了  美女
Listen to me, skank.

468
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,250
你只是被
You just got your stripes

469
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,920
你的旧老板甩掉的鸟人
ripped off your sleeve by your old boss.

470
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,220
不管以前你在公司里的官多大
So whatever clout you had with the Company,

471
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,220
现在都没了
it's gone.

472
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,920
你现在是我的手下
You work for me now.

473
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,520
所以  你在这个乡巴佬面前怎么摆架子都行
So you can try to pull rank on the hick here all you want,

474
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,250
但别把我的耐心当弱点
but don't mistake my patience for weakness.

475
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,620
你还活着只有一个理由
You're alive right now for one reason:

476
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,420
就是我允许你活着
because I'm allowing you to be.

477
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,850
一旦把锡拉弄到手
So when I get Scylla,

478
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,420
你就可以拿到你的报酬
you'll get your traveling money.

479
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,420
而这一切都结束后
And when this is over,

480
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,250
你要是胆敢踏进
if you step one foot

481
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,450
美国半步  我会用
on American soil, I'm gonna take

482
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,790
这把枪...
this gun...

483
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,050
用子弹在你这里
and I'm gonna put a bullet

484
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,720
开个洞
right there.

485
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,750
你也一样  乡巴佬
And that goes for you, too, Gummo.

486
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,020
听清楚了吗
Are we clear?

487
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,220
听清楚了
We're clear.

488
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,750
给  我做的
Here. I made this.

489
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,650
这个图表记录了
It's a chart of all

490
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,050
所以进出这个办公室的人
the people coming in and out of the office,

491
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,890
显示了哪天  什么时段是最忙的
showing which times of the day are the busiest

492
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,320
以及什么时段可以挖掘
and which are best for digging.

493
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,290
只管听电话就行
Just answer the phones.

494
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,090
我会处理这个
I'll handle this.

495
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,220
-拿到了吗  -等等
- Did you get it? - Hold on.

496
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,850
赶快
Hurry up.

497
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,090
为什么要
Why are we doing

498
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,120
再做一次
this again?

499
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,220
如果她想不付锡拉的账
It's an insurance policy.

500
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,620
这就是我们的救命稻草
If she tries to get out of that big Scylla payday.

501
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,520
有多少钱
How big of a payday?

502
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,020
1百万美元
One million dollars.

503
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,920
你如果再用枪指着我
You put a gun on me again,

504
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,050
我就不会单单会把她的指纹复制下来
and these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.

505
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,690
从现在开始  我们是盟友了
From this moment on, we are allies.

506
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,820
她还在看我们吗
She watching?

507
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,420
是的
Yes.

508
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,990
撑着点
Brace yourself.

509
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,990
干嘛
For what?

510
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,190
没叫你  以后不准再踏进我办公室半步
Don't you ever come in my office again unless you're summoned!

511
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,320
布伦斯在车上
Burrows was in the car.

512
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,450
看来情报是可靠的
It appears our source is dependable.

513
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,420
我说引蛇出洞  可不意味着用我做饵
When I said bait the hook, I did not mean with me.

514
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,090
他们差一点就杀了我
They came that close to killing me.

515
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,790
我不会让这种事情发生
I wouldn't let that happen.

516
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,120
如果你不满意我的方法
But if you're unhappy with my methods,

517
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,850
你大可以让别人来做
maybe you should parcel out the job to someone else.

518
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,020
我不接受辞呈
I don't accept resignations.

519
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,790
和神秘人达成协议
Close the deal with the mystery man

520
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,220
今天就把俩兄弟给我抓回来
and bring the brothers to me today

521
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,620
否则你的解雇金就会变成运尸袋
or your severence pay will be a body bag.

522
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,350
光天化日  在大街上  他们知道你的路线
Broad daylight, city street, and they knew your route.

523
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,920
如果斯科菲尔德的任务是想杀你
If Scofield's mission was to kill you,

524
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,490
他会用更好的办法
he'd have a better way to do it.

525
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,350
-还要其他东西吗  -不用
Sara, you have everything you need? No.

526
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,550
没事
I'm good.

527
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,160
一切顺利  好了
Everything's just fine.Alright.

528
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,550
快好了  费尔南多
Almost done, Fernando.

529
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,960
可以了
Now you go.

530
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,420
医生  如果不是你的话 我就死在这桌子上了
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, Doc.

531
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,220
我会等你付诊金的
Mm-hmm. Just wait till you get my bill.

532
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,720
撑着点  苏克雷
Hang in there, Sucre.

533
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,220
就算"公司"还不知道这个仓库
Even if the warehouse ain't on the Company's radar,

534
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,350
我们很清楚被发现后的结果
we sure as hell are.

535
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,390
-这事完了  -你说不准
This job's over. You don't know that.

536
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,050
我只知道  我不想回福克斯河监狱
I ain't going back to Fox River, I know that.

537
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,520
你觉得赛尔夫发现公司把我们弄成这样
What do you think Self is gonna do

538
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,390
他会怎么做
when he finds out the Company made us?

539
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,150
我们很快就会知道
We're about to find out.

540
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,490
喂
Yeah?

541
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,050
罗兰在哪
Hey, where the hell is Roland?

542
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,090
他的全球定位掉线了
His GPS just went offline.

543
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,500
我到了
I'm here.

544
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
怎样
Well?

545
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,190
开丰田走了
Took the Corolla.

546
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,690
-把他的手提也带了吗  -是的
Take his laptop, too? Yeah.

547
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,150
阿历克斯
Alex.

548
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,120
你还好吗
You doing okay?

549
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,050
-医生  还要多久  -快了
How much longer,doc? Almost.

550
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,220
你能处理这些吗
Hey, you got this covered?

551
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,620
你们还在这干什么
What are you still doing here?

552
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,490
去把那兔崽子抓回来
Go get the son of a bitch.

553
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,020
行了
All done.

554
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,720
把钱带来了吗
You got my money?

555
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,590
我以为这是
Oh, yo, I thought this

556
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,420
公平交易  对吧
was going to be a legit business transaction, okay?

557
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,750
你不给我钱  我就不会
You don't got my money, I don't got

558
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,290
-把俩兄弟的地址告诉你  -他们在哪
the location of the brothers. Where are they?

559
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,250
天啊
Oh, God!

560
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,890
你这是干什么
What are you doing?!

561
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,020
莎拉
Sara...

562
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,490
你好  莎拉
Hello, Sara.

563
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,390
我以前的一个导师给我讲过一个故事
A former mentor of mine once told me a story

564
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,450
我觉得很适合这个情况
that I think applies to this situation.

565
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,030
内战结束时  格兰特的联军
At the end of the Civil War, Grant's Union Army

566
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,450
在阿波马托克斯战胜李的联军
had Lee's Confederate soldiers outflanked at Appomattox.

567
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,150
李明白更多流血事件的无益
Lee understood the futility of more bloodshed,

568
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,090
所以他请求停战
so he requested a cease-fire.

569
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,020
他想结束战争
He wanted to bring an end to the fighting.

570
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,350
当天早上还在互相厮杀的士兵
Soldiers that had been killing each other that morning,

571
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,250
下午首次穿过战线
walked across the lines that afternoon

572
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,650
成为同盟
for the first time as allies

573
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,320
互相交换北方的咖啡和南方的烟草
to trade Northern coffee for Southern tobacco.

574
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,520
现在  我不期望我们互换礼品
Now, I don't expect us to exchange gifts,

575
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,890
但不意味着我们不能成为盟友
but that doesn't mean we can't be allies.

576
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,220
当然  你不会和解
Of course, you can't have a cease-fire

577
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,320
除非双方
without both parties

578
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,390
达到各自目的
getting what they want.

579
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,590
你有5分钟
You have five minutes.

580
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,720
随你尽管在我背上加伤疤
Put as many scars on my back as possible.

581
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,450
我不想催你  但只剩4分钟了
I don't want to rush you, but you have four minutes left.

582
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,050
她叫什么名字
What was her name?

583
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,620
只有这一次机会  莎拉
This is a one-time deal, Sara.

584
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,850
你要血债血还  现在就动手
You want your pound of flesh, you take it now.

585
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,320
-她叫什么名字  -谁
What was her name? Who?

586
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,650
看守的人
The guard--

587
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,050
你射杀  死在我怀里的人
the one you shot and left to die in my arms.

588
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,250
就为这个
That's what this is about?

589
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,090
一个不尽职的看守人
A guard that couldn't do her job?

590
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,490
她叫什么名字
What was her name?

591
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,520
她叫什么名字
What was her name?

592
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,920
泰勒
Taylor.

593
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,690
她的姓呢
Her first name?

594
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,190
米歇尔  我想
Michelle... I think.

595
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,990
你应该清楚  这不是为我
You should know that this isn't about me.

596
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,320
我能忍受你在我背上留的伤疤
I can handle the scars you put on my back,

597
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,850
但你对米歇尔的作为
but what you did to Michelle...

598
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,720
我得服从命令  她想帮你逃跑
I had orders. She tried to help you escape.

599
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,720
她帮我逃脱了  她不是想
She did help me escape. She didn't try.

600
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,020
莎拉
Sara...

601
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,420
你只想着用她来杀鸡儆猴
You were too busy making an example out of her

602
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,320
没想到找她留给我的钥匙
to find the key that she left with me.

603
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,750
她也得到应有的惩罚了
Then she got what she deserved.

604
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,090
她救了我
She saved my life.

605
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,420
而你杀了她
And you took her's.

606
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,620
你达到目的了
You proved your point.

607
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,890
我们扯平了
We're even.

608
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,090
我们还离扯平远着呢
We're a long way from even.

609
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,390
等这个结束了  你会为米歇尔付出代价
And when this is over, you'll pay for Michelle.

610
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,790
他们在哪
Where are they?

611
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,350
在膝盖骨上中一枪
The thing about a gunshot to the kneecap--
