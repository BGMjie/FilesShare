我们尽可能的优化了图像
We refined the image the best we could,

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,530
但是我们还是需要
but we're going to need

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,130
你的专家们把图像做的更清晰
one of your specialists to sharpen the video

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,900

既然他和你在一栋大楼里  你就能接近他了
Well, if he's in your building you can get close to him.

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,900

就说阿凯达组织偷了很多债券
Something about Al Qaeda using stolen bearer bonds

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,290
来资助地下活动  随便你

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,000
不是吧  编造虚假言论
Come on, making false claims

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,700
损害政府威信
in matters affecting government?

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,430
那可是要判五年刑的
That's up to five years in prison.

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,700
欢迎成为我们的一员  赛尔夫探员

我一直想出来见你
I would have come out to see you,

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,160
但是我不能走太远
but I can't travel that far...

43
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,000
不好意思
I'm sorry...

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,530
你说你有些照片要给我看
but you said that you had some pictures to show me.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,530
就是他
That's him.

46
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,600
我会尽快和你联系
I'll get in touch with you

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,000
一旦我...
as soon as...

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,500
一旦我查出是谁干的
as soon as... I find out.

49
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,630
不是你的错
You didn't do this.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,060
你其实一直是个好人
In your heart, you are a really good man.

51
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,660
因此我嫁给你
That's why I married you.

52
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,830
因此我和你成家
That's why I started a family with you.

53
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,060
还记得你经常带着文件回家
Remember when you used to bring your files home

54
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,960
我总是求你把那些东西留在办公室
and I would beg you to leave that stuff at work?

55
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,030
但是当你看到了坏人
But when you have a monster in your sights...

56
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,130
只有抓到他
you can't focus

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,000
你才能在意你身边的人
until you get him.

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,400
我以前很恨你那样
I used to hate that about you.

59
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,760
现在只有一件事能安慰我自己
Right now it's the only thing that lets me sleep,

60
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,800
那就是我相信
because I know...

61
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,330
你会抓到凶手
you're going to get him.

62
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,860
你在干什么
What are you doing?

63
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,360
你好啊 布伦尼
Hey there, Blauney.

64
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,660
只是
Just, uh...

65
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,630
做一些调查
doing a little research.

66
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,300
关于伽特公司的
Gate-related?

67
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,530
这样才更能让我发挥实力
I'm adding a little flourish to my pitch.

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,100
我不能像笼中之鸟一样
"Like the caged macaw

69
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,830
无法展翅翱翔
who cannot spread her wings."

70
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,130
其实  科尔
You know, Cole...

71
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,630
我一直在想你应该少花点时间空想
I was thinking maybe you should spend a little less time

72
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,760
多花一点时间做点实事
practicing and a little more time actually pitching.

73
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,700
我的意思是  世界第一的销售员
I mean, number one salesman in the world?

74
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,160
我们一直盼望着
We're all just waiting with bated breath

75
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,000
你能做点什么
to see what you can do around here.

76
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,830
唉
Ouch.

77
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,660
我知道
I know.

78
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,860
我们看见了他在那里
We saw him right here.

79
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,930
嘿
Hey.

80
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,030
嘿
Hey.

81
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,000
你见过莎拉吗
You haven't seen Sara, have you?

82
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,700
没有
No.

83
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,600
你想回福克斯河
You want to end up back in Fox River,

84
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,600
就回去吧
you just go right ahead.

85
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,700
嘿  怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

86
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,560
-他想去找T-bag  -算你说对了
0He wants to look for T-Bag. -You're damn right.

87
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,130
我就是要找他  我们知道他有那本书
I want to look for him.We know he's got the bird book.

88
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,030
也知道那本书里写着打入内部的计划
We know the bird book's got the plan for the break-in.

89
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,430
而且我们今天在这儿看见那个混蛋了
And we saw that snake right here today.

90
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,930
我的意思是  我们是逃犯
All I'm saying is, it ain't safe

91
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,900
所以  我们来找另外一个逃犯
for a member of the Fox River Eight to be out there looking

92
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,730
-是非常不安全的  -没错  但是
-for another member of the Fox River Eight. -Yes, but...

93
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,030
贝里克  你和苏克雷一起去
Bellick, I want you to go with Sucre,

94
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,860
仔细查查这个地区  看看你能不能找到他的线索
canvass the area, see if you can get a lead on him.

95
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,200
那里有六栋大楼
There are like six big buildings over there.

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,630
他可能在任何一个里面
He could be in any one of them.

97
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,260
所以我说仔细查查
That's why it's called canvassing.

98
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,030
你知道吧  这可是在财政部里行动啊
You do realize this is the Treasury Department, right?

99
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,800
你让赛尔夫下几层楼
You tell Self to go down a few floors,

100
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,960
只要能看到那几台重要电脑
walk past the right computers

101
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,360
我们就会变成大富翁了
and we are billionaires.

102
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,600
拜托  我只要那张卡
Just the card, please.

103
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,000
当・赛尔夫  国土安全局
Don Self, Homeland Security.

104
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,660
-我需要马上与奥林先生会面  -他现在不在
-I need to see Mr. Oren right away. -He's not available.

105
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,960
我需要马上见他
Ma'am, I need to see him

106
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,660
否则的话  成千上万美国人
right away, otherwise hundreds of American lives

107
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,100
的生命将会受到威胁
will be in jeopardy.

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,600
当・赛尔夫  国土安全局
Don Self, Homeland Security.

109
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,930
去和大厅里的安吉拉说
Talk to Angela down the hall.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,260
长官  对不起我闯了进来
Sir, I'm sorry to barge in here,

111
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,330
但是这事很紧急
but this is urgent.

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,660
我知道
I'm sure it is.

113
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,200
去和大厅里的安吉拉说
Talk to Angela down the hall.

114
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,030
长官  我们听说有一些债券被偷了
Sir,we are hearing chatter about some stolen bearer bonds,

115
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,060
而且我们也相信这个事情和阿凯达组织有关
and we have reason to believe that Al Qaeda operatives...

116
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,560
你有债券的号码吗
You have serial numbers?

117
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,430
我没有
No, I do not.

118
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,730
介意转过去吗
Mind turning around?

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,100
不介意
Not at all.

120
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,030
六小时后  我要去亚洲
I leave for Asia in six hours.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
他找到了
He's got it.

122
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,760
在那之前
Until then...

123
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,400
我要和几个部门主管开会
I've got meetings with the bureau chiefs

124
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,830
包括联邦调查局  中情局  国土安全局
of the FBI, the CIA and Homeland Security.

125
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
信号没了
It's gone.

126
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,360
如果你现在告诉我的事情真的重要
If what you tell me is actually important,

127
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,830
我会从你的上司那里知道
I'll hear about it from your boss.

128
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,300
除非那样
Until then...

129
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,560
否则一切事情去和大厅里的安吉拉说
talk to Angela down the hall.

130
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,830
而且  你如果在没有我的允许下
And if you set foot

131
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,960
再进入我的办公室
in my office again without my prior consent,

132
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,960
我会让你在阿拉斯加
I will see to it that you spend the rest

133
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,730
边防站呆到退休
of our career running border security in Alaska.

134
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,030
拿到了吗
Did we get it?

135
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,200
怎么了
What happened?

136
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,430
什么怎么了
What do you mean what happened?

137
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,560
只有几秒钟信号  然后就没了
We had it for two seconds and then it disappeared.

138
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,600
一定是在保险箱里
It's in the safe.

139
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
他办公室里有个超安全的保险箱
He has this crazy safe in his office.

140
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,230
信号肯定是被保险箱屏蔽了
That must have been blocking the transmission.

141
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,960
我确定卡就在那里放着
I'll bet you that's where he keeps the card.

142
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,360
那我们就要想办法打开保险箱
So we need to get into that safe.

143
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,930
相信我  绝对没办法打开的
Trust me, there's no way to crack that thing.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,830
过几个小时  我就会有其他持卡人
Look,I'll have the enhanced images of the other

145
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,860
清晰的照片了  我们再从那里入手
cardholders in a couple of hours,we'll go from there.

146
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,430
你能找到大楼的图纸  对吧
You can access the building's blueprints, right?

147
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,800
我不能再回去了
I can't go back up there.

148
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,860
没让你回去  我们来处理这个问题
No one's asking you. We'll take care of that.

149
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,530
算了吧  你们连正门都进不去
Come on, you'll never get past the front door, okay?

150
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,060
就算他们不认识你们
Even if they don't recognize you,

151
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,100
你还要有出入的通行证  上面有...
you need a security card that matches...

152
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,130
找到图纸  然后来找我  好吗
Get the blueprints and get back here, all right?

153
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
好吧
Yeah...

154
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,600
莎拉  出什么事了
Sara, what happened?

155
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,430
我很好  但是有人跟踪我
I'm fine, but someone was following me.

156
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,360
我在离这一英里左右的地方甩甩掉了他
I lost him about a mile back.

157
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,330
我觉得他不可能跟着我到这里了
I don't think there's any way he could have

158
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,160
-我很确定  -他长什么样子
-followed me here.I made sure of that. -What'd he look like?

159
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,300
很高  黑人  还有胡子
Uh, tall, black. He had a beard.

160
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
是这个人吗
Is this the guy?

161
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,430
是的
Yeah.

162
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,730
这是谁
Who's that?

163
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,230
是他杀了我儿子
That's the man who killed my son.

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,230
现在冲着我们来了
Now he's coming to kill us.

165
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,520
你第一次是在哪里看见的他
Where were you the first time that you saw him?

166
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,420
第一次
The very first time?

167
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,680
回家的时候
Walking home.

168
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,350
他有没有在街上和你打招呼
He didn't just run into you on the street?

169
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,350
那你之前在哪里
Where were you before that?

170
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,050
提朗格
The Towne Lounge.

171
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
是不是酒吧
Is that a bar?

172
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,550
有什么问题吗
Do you have a problem with that?

173
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,780
不是  我只是想知道你在那里待了多长时间
No, I just want to know how long you were there.

174
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,820
莎拉
Sara,

175
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,350
我要找到这个人  而且我需要你的帮助
I need to find this guy and I can't do it without your help.

176
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,520
我不管你为什么要去那个酒吧  或者你干了什么
I don't care why or what you were doing in the bar.

177
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,280
我就是想知道你在那里待了多长时间
I just really want to know how long you were there.

178
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,880
好吧  几个小时
Okay. A couple hours.

179
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,480
谢谢你  他肯定留下了什么蛛丝马迹
Thank you. So something must have tipped him off.

180
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,650
你付的是现金  对吗
You paid cash, right?

181
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
当然了
Of course.

182
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,950
但是布鲁斯给我的信用卡没了
But the credit card that Bruce gave me is gone.

183
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,050
什么信用卡
What credit card?

184
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,220
这些是安全检查点
These are the security checkpoints.

185
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,150
如果你没有这个  你一处也过不去
You can't get past one of those unless you have one of these.

186
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,480
我们能不能伪造几个
Any way we can forge it?

187
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,680
当然了  如果你有两个星期
Sure, if you have two weeks and access

188
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,680
并且能进入大楼的主机
to the building's mainframe maybe.

189
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,050
好像十楼没有
Well, doesn't look like there are any security checkpoints

190
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,050
-安全检查点  -是的
-on the tenth floor. -No, just that

191
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,550
只有能到十楼的几个地方有
all the access points to the tenth floor.

192
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,080
但是  如果你能神奇的
But if you could somehow magically appear

193
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,220
出现在大厅的中间  你就安全了
and wind up in the middle of the hallway, you'd be fine,

194
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,050
不过那里到处都是政府官员
except for all the government officials who'd be swarming

195
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,750
他们一眨眼就能把你抓住
around and who would arrest you in a heartbeat.

196
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,720
如果你把我们带到停车场
And if you can get us into the parking structure,

197
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,750
保安会查我们的车吗
will security check our van?

198
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,150
当然了  车里可以藏罪犯  为什么不查
Sure. Transporting known felons, why not?

199
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,750
那么  停车场
So, the parking garage.

200
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,350
就是我们进去的地方
This is our point of entry.

201
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,980
我们需要关于保险箱的细节
We need the details to the safe.

202
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,120
有一个徽章在保险箱上面
Okay, the, um, the safe has an insignia on it.

203
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,550
看起来和这个很像
It looks something like this.

204
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,550
你要用点这个
You're gonna need some of this.

205
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,680
我在洛杉矶找到了莎拉・唐克雷蒂
I got a positive ID of Sara Tancredi in Los Angeles.

206
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,080
这意味着迈克尔・斯科菲尔德也在
That means Michael Scofield was here.

207
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,820
还有林肯・布鲁斯  为什么
That means Lincoln Burrows is here. Why?

208
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,850
莎拉  是吧
Sara, huh?

209
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,580
她就是一个狡猾的小贱人
She's a slippery little bitch, isn't she?

210
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,550
你没什么时间耍滑头了  格雷琴
Time is not on your side, Gretchen.

211
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,220
可能你一直没注意
Maybe you hadn't noticed,

212
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,750
既然你可以一直
but since you seem to be somewhat immune

213
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,780
抵抗对你身体的折磨
to physical coercion,

214
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,550
我们决定换个方式
we've decided to move on.

215
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,950
鼻子是一个进化的奇迹
The nose is an evolutionary marvel.

216
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,250
我们的大脑会告诉我们
Our brain has been constructed so that certain aromas...

217
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,880
咖啡豆  蓝莓的气味对我们的身体是有益的
...coffee beans, blueberries that are helpful to our body,

218
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,680
我们可以感觉到这些东西是令人舒适的
we perceive as pleasant.

219
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,580
相反的  有一些气味以为着死亡
Whereas other smells that signify death,

220
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,520
疾病
disease.

221
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,350
开始的症状有恶心  头晕
Initial symptoms include nausea, dizziness,

222
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,650
红眼  所有你现在所感受到的
burning eyes, all of which you are experiencing right now.

223
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,580
如果长时间接近会造成眩晕
Prolonged exposure will lead to faintness,

224
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,820
快速的失去意识
rapid degradation of your mental faculties.

225
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,250
告诉我
Tell me.

226
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,150
我什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

227
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,180
再给你一天时间
You've got one more day.

228
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,450
上等货色
Top of the line.

229
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,880
根据生理特征设计
It's a biometric design,

230
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,220
而且只有奥林的指纹可以打开
and only Oren's fingerprint will open it.

231
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,450
那我们就从他碰过的东西上取下他的指纹
So we lift his prints off something he touched.

232
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,480
触摸器知道皮肤触摸的感觉
The pad knows what human skin feels like.

233
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,980
如果我们骗它  它就会拉响警报
If we try to trick it, we'll set off the alarm.

234
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,980
而且还有12位的密码设计
And then there's the 12-digit key code.

235
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,250
那铰链呢
What about the hinges?

236
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,250
链接着警报
Wired to the alarm.

237
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,680
那我们就钻吧
We drill it.

238
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,750
可能可以从金属的外层钻
Through the outer layer of steel maybe,

239
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,450
但是这个东西是由7.5英寸厚
but the bones of this thing are three-quarters inch

240
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,920
钴合金做成的
of cobalt alloy hard plate.

241
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,480
我们没时间用钻的方法
Drilling's not gonna work, not in our timeframe.

242
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,280
简单来说  我们有办法进入停车场
All right, so basically, we have a way to get you

243
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,420
但是你们别忘了
into the garage, which, in case you guys forgot,

244
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,420
这样的话会给我多加四项罪名
that puts me on the hook for another four charges.

245
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,720
而且你们还没有办法到十楼
But no way to get you up to the tenth floor.

246
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,580
就算你们到十楼了
But let's say you do get up to the tenth floor.

247
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,880
你们还要在光天化日之下  在奥林的办公室里
Then we need to get you into Oren's office for an hour

248
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,020
待一个小时
during the middle of the day.

249
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,020
接着我们就要期盼
Then, we need to hope

250
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,480
奥林的同事不会听到
that not one of Oren's co-workers is gonna hear

251
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,350
因为要打开保险箱使用的
the extremely loud drill that you're gonna be using

252
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,580
巨大的钻机的声音
to break into a safe that I'm telling you

253
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,020
而且这个保险箱我们是不可能打开的
cannot be broken into.

254
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,720
你知不知道  还有
Do you understand there are Homeland agents

255
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,050
由安全局的探员设计的保安措施
whose sole job is to design safety measures

256
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,220
以确保这个地方是坚不可摧的
to make this structure impregnable.

257
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,350
以前在福克斯河也是这样
Yeah. They had those guys Fox River, too.

258
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,550
这个办公室是谁的
Whose office is this?

259
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,750
山姆・米尔顿  司法部的
Sam Middleton, Department of Justice.

260
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,280
这面墙正好在米尔顿和沃勒的中间
This wall separates Middleton from Warren.

261
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,420
我需要一些工具
I'm gonna need some supplies.

262
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,280
信用卡在10点32分的时候在酒吧用过
The credit card was used at the bar at 10:32.

263
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,650
你什么时候看到他的
What time did you see him?

264
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,880
大概11点的时候
About 11:00.

265
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,580
你当时走了多长时间了
And how long were you walking at that time?

266
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,280
10 15分钟
Ten, 15 minutes.

267
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,780
我们假设他在家接到了电话
Let's assume that he was at his place when we received the call.

268
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,680
开车18分钟
That's an 18-minute drive

269
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,880
才能到圣佩德罗的提朗格酒吧
from the Towne Lounge Bar in San Pedro.

270
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,880
如果按平均30英里每小时计算
Averaging 30 miles an hour the whole way,

271
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,450
大概就是9英里的范围
that's a, that's a nine-mile radius.

272
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,120
那他就是在这个圈里
So he's gonna be somewhere around the perimeter of that circle.

273
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,120
他肯定是在高速公路附近
He's got to be mobile

274
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,080
半英里以内的地方
within a half mile of a major freeway.

275
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,450
10号  110号  405号
The 10, the 110, the 405.

276
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,020
没有固定住址  那我们就找旅店  对吗
No permanent address, so we're looking for hotels, right?

277
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,220
对  不要找帮客人停车的旅店
Yeah, but nowhere where you need to valet your car.

278
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,250
因为他要随时使用汽车
It's got to be readily accessible at all times.

279
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,780
而且  不要找
And somewhere you don't need

280
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,080
用信用卡付钱的地方  明白吗
to put a credit card down for incidentals. You got that?

281
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,920
我看看我能不能找到
I'll see what I can do.

282
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,480
快点
Hurry.

283
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,620
崔什娜  我要一杯柠檬茶
Trishanne, I'm gonna need a mug of tea with lemon.

284
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,150
抱歉  科尔  我现在走不开
I'm sorry, Cole. I can't leave the desk right now.

285
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,650
好帮手还真难找
Good help is so hard to find.

286
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,820
有什么可以效劳的吗
May I help you?

287
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,120
我们是高谷保险的人
We're with Upper Valley Insurance.

288
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,920
这人继承了一份10万美金的遗产
And this man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

289
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,920
我们找不到他  所以现在提供
We can't track him down, so we're offering

290
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,920
百分之十的费用
a ten percent finder's fee

291
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
给提供线索的人
to anyone who can point us in his direction.

292
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,020
天啊  什么  1万美金
Oh, my gosh. What, $10,000?

293
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,880
对
Yeah.

294
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,850
抱歉  我不认识他
I'm sorry. I don't recognize him.

295
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,880
好的  如果你见到他  麻烦打电话给我们
Okay,so if you do see him,would you please give us a call?

296
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,280
谢谢
Thank you.

297
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,520
伽特
"GATE"?

298
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,480
成功通向卓越
"Greatness Achieved Through Excellence."

299
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,880
做玩具吗
A toy?

You want to try to explain this?

不  我知道你安排了庭审
Yeah. No,I just,I know you have these trial dates coming up

305
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,380
我们只是想确认你们有确凿的证据
and we just want to make sure you have everything

306
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,680
给这帮混蛋定罪
you need to convict these bastards.

307
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,450
太好了
Okay, that's terrific.

308
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,350
好的  待会见
All right, I'll see you then.

309
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,950
好的
All right,

310
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,350
我们约好吃午餐

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,120
我会尽量拖延他
I'll keep him out of his office for as long as I can.

313
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,420
好的
All right.

314
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,820
-喂  -有他的消息吗
-Hello. -Hey, any sign of him?

315
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,320
没有  我们查了10栋楼了
No, we checked about ten buildings,

316
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,680
但没发现什么
but nothing so far.

317
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,820
算了吧  我们要找下一张卡
Well, scrap it; we're going after the next card.

318
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,320
在圣摩尼卡和西世纪街角等我
Meet me on the corner of Santa Monica and Century West.

319
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,650
你好  查理
Hey, Charlie.

320
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,920
美国队昨晚又输了
Yankees lost again last night.

321
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,880
对  至少粉丝们在
Yeah, well, at least our fans show up

322
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,450
第5局前到了  对不对
before the fifth inning, right?

323
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,850
祝你愉快  查理
Have a good day, all right, Charlie?

324
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,480
你也是  赛尔夫先生
You, too, Mr. Self.

325
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,750
我跟你们说清楚
I'm letting you guys know right now.

326
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,480
你们要是被抓了  别提我的名字
If you get buzzy,don't mention my name.

327
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,720
准备好了
We're ready.

328
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,920
开始
Now.

329
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,950
1  2  3
One, two, three.

330
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,520
嗨
So...

331
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,950
两个邋遢鬼来过
a couple of scruffy guys walk in,

332
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,520
说他们是保险公司的
tell me they're from the insurance company

333
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,820
如果我说出你的下落  他们就给我1万美金
and they offer me $10,000 if I know where you are.

334
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,450
直觉告诉我
Something tells me

335
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,220
这里有更高的报酬
there's a better offer on the table.

336
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,880
当然  崔什娜
Well, I'll be, Trishanne.

337
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,880
你刚刚抓了个小精灵
You just caught yourself a leprechaun.

338
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,580
就像传说那样
And as the legend goes,

339
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,420
你能实现一个愿望  任何愿望
you got yourself one wish, anything in the world.

340
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,280
是吗
Oh, really?

341
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,720
我会帮你实现
And I am bound to grant it.

342
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,480
-是吗  -恩
-Yeah? -Mm-hmm.

343
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,250
你的分红支票还在我台面
Well, your commencement check's sitting on my desk

344
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,750
等你签收
waiting to be signed.

345
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,550
这倒是个不错的报酬
That's a pretty nice pot of gold.

346
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,180
在你开口前...
Before you say another word...

347
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,180
告诉你
Now, it's true

348
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,050
精灵不会拒绝捕获者的要求
leprechauns cannot refuse their captor's demands,

349
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,380
但一旦他们认为
but if they deem her

350
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,520
她是个贪婪之徒
to be greedy or covetous,

351
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,950
不管她要求什么  都会伴随着
whatever she desires will certainly be accompanied

352
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,720
可怕的诅咒
with disastrous tidings.

353
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
这也是传说
Or so the legend goes.

354
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,850
只要分红的百分之三
Three percent of your commission

355
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,050
然后一笔勾销
from here on out.

356
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,720
成交
Done.

357
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,480
当・赛尔夫来找你
Don Self to see you.

358
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,220
你可以进去了
You can go right on in.

359
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,580
-谢谢  祝您愉快  -你也是
-Thank you. Have a great day. -You too.

360
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,750
嘿  山姆
Hey, Sam.

361
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,750
很高兴见到你
Great to meet you.

362
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,780
我也是
Same here.

363
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,420
谢谢你能临时
Oh, thanks again for squeezing me in

364
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,450
挤出时间给我
on such short notice.

365
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,620
我想我们倒是
I figure we had so much

366
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,820
还有很多时间  这是最好的办法
to get through, this'd be the best way.

367
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,780
我以为我们出去吃
I-I thought we were going out for lunch.

368
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,550
有问题吗
Is there a problem?

369
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,120
实际上...
actually, um...

370
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
我是吃素的
I'm a vegetarian.

371
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,120
新的减肥食谱  不过楼下
It's a new diet, b-b-but there's

372
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,920
倒是有个不错的地方
a great place down the street,

373
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,620
我请客
and it'll be my treat.

374
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,950
伊利斯
Elise.

375
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,950
是  先生
Yes, sir?

376
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,880
我出去吃饭
I'm heading out for lunch.

377
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,320
抓好
Hold it there.

378
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,820
不好意思  我想取些
Sorry, I was just coming in to...

379
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,280
女洗手间没有手纸了
There's no more TP in the ladies room.

380
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,550
我们一会就送去
We'll get right on that.

381
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,580
能不能现在就要
How about you get it right now?

382
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,080
这是这里最好的了
Best we got in here.

383
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,950
你们干活应该有点条理
You guys need to get better organized.

384
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,950
搜索到了53家旅馆
53 hotels match the search criteria.

385
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,080
你知道我刚才
You know I read, I read this article

386
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,380
看了一篇文章
a little while ago, right?

387
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,450
讲的是先天所有和后天培养的关系
About the whole, uh, nature versus nurture thing,

388
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,550
每个人之所以生得不同
and it turns out, it's all kind of a mishmash

389
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,320
是因为DNA早就决定了一切
because DNA trumps everything.

390
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,550
我很信这个
And I believe it, because

391
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,080
因为我和我哥我姐生在同样的家庭
I mean, I grew up in the same house,

392
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,080
我和我哥上同样的学校
uh, went to the same school as my brother,

393
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,750
他现在是数学系教授
who's a math professor,

394
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,120
我姐也是个儿科医生
My sister's a pediatrician.

395
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,020
我却是个贼
And I'm a thief who blows his money

396
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,150
把钱都花在妓女身上了
on hookers and coke.

397
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,620
同样  斯科菲尔德是天才
So, like the same way Scofield's hardwired to be a genius,

398
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,120
你生来就是执法的
and you are always gonna be a lawman, right?

399
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,450
我想说的是  无论是谁
I mean, whoever this guy is,

400
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,920
都不想变成杀人犯吧
you think he wanted to grow up to be a murderer?

401
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,920
不会吧
Probably not.

402
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,550
说话小心点
Be very careful choosing the next words

403
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,080
别张嘴就来
that come out of your mouth.

404
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,320
我只是想说
I... I'm just saying.

405
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,320
我们就是我们自己
We are who we are.

406
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,750
杰克  现在到1018办公室来
Jake. I'm gonna need you in front of room 1018. Now.

407
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,150
-怎么了  -抱歉  女士
-What's going on?  -I apologize, ma'am,

408
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,580
我们要妨碍到你了
but we're gonna be in your way

409
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,380
大概得弄一个半小时
for the next 90 minutes or so.

410
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,350
-布莱克  -来了
-Black? -Yeah.

411
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,750
不好意思  女士
Excuse me, ma'am,

412
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,750
有没有插座
but where can I plug in?

413
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,250
你现在可以用办公室里的
For now, you can go in there,

414
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,980
但我老板吃完午饭回来后
but when my boss gets back from lunch,

415
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,280
你就...
you're gonna...

416
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,080
保险箱应该在这面墙后面
The safe should be somewhere behind this wall.

417
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,520
你钻穿保险箱之后
As soon as you're through the steel,

418
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,780
我的铝热剂也准备好了
I'll have the thermite ready.

419
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,880
怎么了
What is it?

420
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,920
你这样多久了
How long has it been happening?

421
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,680
小事一桩
It's not a big deal.

422
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,780
你13岁的时候这可不是什么小事
It was a big deal when you were 13.

423
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,580
跟我保证不要告诉莎拉
Just promise me you won't tell Sara.

424
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,020
莎拉是医生  她能帮你的
Sara's a doctor. She can help.

425
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,880
我只是不适应这边燥热的天气  行么?
Look, I acclimating to the warmer climate, all right?

426
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,480
拜托  我们还有活干呢
Come on. We've got work to do.

427
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,780
开始吧
Let's go.

428
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,050
我不知道这个公司是干什么的
I don't know what this company is up to, but it sure

429
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,150
但看上去涉及一大笔钱
sounds like there's a whole lot of money involved.

430
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,080
不清楚
I don't know.

431
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,320
丽莎・特巴克刚刚飞到老挝对吧?
Lisa Tabak just hopped a flight to Laos, didn't she?

432
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,420
好像是
Yeah, I guess.

433
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,650
而且格里芬・奥林刚说过
And now Griffin Oren just said

434
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,820
他要去亚洲
he was going somewhere in Asia.

435
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,720
打到里层了
Down to the cobalt.

436
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,180
好的
Right.

437
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,650
想喝点什么
What can I get you?

438
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,280
耽误你一点时间
Just a moment of your time.

439
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,380
我是私人侦探
I'm a private investigator,

440
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,650
我为一个叫做
and I'm working with a woman

441
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,820
莎拉・唐克雷蒂的女人工作
named Sara Tancredi,

442
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,850
她之前来过你这
and she was recently a patron of yours.

443
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,350
我不想被扯进来
I don't want to get involved.

444
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,050
她为了躲这个人
She moved all the way across the country

445
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,820
从东部躲到西部来
to get away from this guy.

446
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,550
帮我  不要让这个人找到她
Help me find him before he finds her.

447
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,680
莎拉和你聊过很多吧
Last time, Sara had a broken jaw.

448
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,650
他走的时候我在前门
I was standing by the front door when he left.

449
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,380
之后看到他经过
A second later I saw him come past,

450
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,620
从他的车里拿了些东西出来
take something out of his car.

451
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
你记得不记得是什么样的车
Do you remember what the car looked like?

452
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,480
灰色轿车  很像租车公司的车
Gray. A sedan,sort of like one of those rental cars,you know?

453
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,750
有什么事么

如果我听到他坐下的声音的话
If I could hear him sitting down, there's no way

487
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,220
他不可能听不到钻的噪音

-完了  -是的
-100. -Yeah.

567
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,420
我不清楚你如何吃下那只螃蟹的  当
I don't know how you eat that crap, Don.

568
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,250
-那个叫什么来着  豆豉吗  -是啊

569
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,120
我看你很勉强才把他吞下去的
It looked like you could barely choke it down.

570
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,150
这个需要三思而后行
Yeah, well, it's an acquired taste.

571
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,150
打扰一下
Excuse us.

572

很高兴和你一起

575
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,020
很显然  有数以万计的假钞在市场中泛滥
Apparently, billions in counterfeit currency flooded the economy,

576
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,050
是什么引起这些问题呢
which is what caused it all.

577
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,050
我所不明白的是为什么
What I don't understand is why?

578
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,880
那些持卡人
I mean, so far all the cardholders

579
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,420
都是他们所在领域的专家
have been experts in their fields, right?

580
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,880
无论是在能源方面  物流方面
In-in energy, and logistics,

581
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,880
还是金融方面
and finance.

582
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,480
我是说  他们看起来
I mean, it looks like

583
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,480
想要摧毁这个国家
they're trying to tear the country down.

584
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,480
然后通过重建来获取利益
And then they profit by rebuilding it.

585
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,520
所以问题是  接下里会是什么
So the question is: what's next?

586
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,450
几天前我在一个酒吧里
I was at a bar earlier.

587
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,050
我没有喝酒  也没有发生任何的事情
And nothing happened, and I didn't drink.

588
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,780
听着  如果这让你很难受
But... Look, if-if this is too much for you...

589
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,250
不  不
No. No.

590
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,650
那么我们忘了它好了
Because, say the word, and we'll scrap the whole thing.

591
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,080
我答应你  以后不会再发生了
That's a promise. It's not going to happen again.

592
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,220
如果我不和你说的话  那么这就是一个谎言了
But it would be a lie not to tell you, and I...

593
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,920
我想你知道  我永远也不会欺骗你
want you to know that I'll never lie to you.

594
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,720
对不起
I'm sorry.

595
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,880
有人找你
Somebody's here for you.

596
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,880

东西在哪里

我赶很远的路过来的  普发先生
I've traveled a long way, Mr. Pfeiffer.

606
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,720
我的忍耐是有限度的
My patience is wearing thin.

607
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,880
耍小把戏对我们都没有好处
Playing games is not going to be good for either of us.

608
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,380
锡拉在哪里
Scylla. Where is it?

609
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,520
普发先生  我现在在工作
Mr. Pfeiffer? I'm at work.

610
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,650
我没有多余的时间和你交谈
It's not exactly like I can talk freely, you know.

611
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,320
我直接进入主题吧
Just-just tell me the latest.

612
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,350
主题 对吗
The latest?

613
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,350
如果你在截止日期之前
If you deliver it

614

把东西交给我
to me by the end of the day,

615
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,780
我会按我们约好的金额付款给你

如果你明天给我
Get it to me by tomorrow

618

619
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,420

620
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
大后天
Three days,

621
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,920
那么我就打爆你的头
I shoot you through the brain.

622
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,950
这就是主题
That is the latest.

623
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,750
没问题
No problem.

624
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,480
看起来这些尿不新鲜了
I thought that urine might be getting a little stale.

625
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,520
所以我给你带了一些新的来
So I brought you some more.

626
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,420
增强了影像的视频恢复了
Hey, the image enhancement for the video came back.

627

我发给你的收到了没
Did you get what I sent over?

628
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,580
三位持卡人吗
All three cardholders?

629
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,950
是的  前面两位持卡人
Yeah, well, for the first two,

630
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,280
我们可以获得一切我们想要的资料
we have names, addresses--

631
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,550
例如  名字  地址等等
everything we need to grab them.

632
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,980
莎拉
Sara.

633
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,520
但我们得不到任何有关将军的资料
But for the General... we got nothing.

634
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,350
这个家伙像石头里蹦出来的一样
This guy's a ghost.

635
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,320
你还好吧
You all right?

636
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,680
在巴拿马发生的大部分事情  我都不太清楚
Look,most of what happened to me in Panama is a total blank.

637
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,920
但
But, um,

638
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,520
当我被挟持的时候
when I was being held, I could hear

639
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,820
我隐约听到格雷琴在隔壁讲电话
Gretchen talking on the phone, in the next room.

640
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,850
她在接受
And she was taking orders

641
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,620
老大的指令
from the guy in charge.

642
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
她称他为将军
And she called him the General.

643
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,380
任务的指挥者吗
In charge of the mission?

644
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,720
不  我认为是公司的大老板
No, I think in charge of the Company.

645
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,620
我早告诉过你
I told you...

646
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,120
有机会时我们就应该杀了格雷琴
we should have killed Gretchen when we had the chance.

647
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,020
她会回来的
She'll come home.

648
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,320
她一直如此
She always has.

649
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,280
希望你是对的
You better be sure about that.

650
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,280
打扰一下
Excuse me, sir?

651
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,280
怎么了
What?

652
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,280

Someone at Homeland Security

653
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,280
通过增强影像搜索了你
did an enhanced image search on you today.

654
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,980
然而我们不知道原始图片...
We couldn't tell where the original picture...

655
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,780
谁
Who?

656
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,550
搜索人的名字
The guy who ordered it...

657
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,750
叫做当・赛尔夫
his name is Don Self.
