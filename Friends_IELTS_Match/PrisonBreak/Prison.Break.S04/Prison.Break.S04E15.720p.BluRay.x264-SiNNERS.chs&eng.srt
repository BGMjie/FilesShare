额外奖励

克兰兹已经安排了世上最好的医生

00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,400
这是我们唯一的选择

不  我怀疑你的目的
No. I'm questioning your motives.

35
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,430
当一个人正遭受痛苦的折磨
When a fellow human being is suffering,

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,230
我们为什么不能帮他一把
why would we not want to lend a hand?

同情  莎拉
Empathy, Sara,

38
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,400

手术进行的同时
For the duration of the surgery,

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,430

斯科菲尔德先生  虽然你会被麻醉

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,060
而且不会感到任何明显的疼痛
and should feel no significant pain, we will need to keep

47
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,500
但是  我们需要你在手术中保持清醒
you awake for the duration of the procedure.

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,100
为安全起见  我们需要一直监视
As a safety precaution, we'll need to continually monitor

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,060
你的语言和感知能力  这样才能确定
your speech and sensory activity to insure the tissue

50
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,160
病体被去除的同时  不会给你带来任何后遗症
being removed will not leave you impaired in any way.

51
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,130
这是什么医院
What hospital is this?

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,460
不用担心  这有最好的医生
Don't worry about it. You've got some good doctors

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,300
为你治疗

54
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,630
我要拿回"锡拉"
I have to get Scylla.

55
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,160

现在不行
Not now.

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,330
林肯在哪
Where's Linc?

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
他也在这
He's here.

59
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,060
他很好
He's just fine.

60
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,260
迈克尔手术完成前  我是不会离开的
I'm not leaving until Michael has his surgery.

61
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,230
如果你不履行我们之间的承诺
And I'm not starting surgery until you prove

62
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,500
我是不会让他们给迈克尔动手术的
you can hold up your end of the deal.

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,100
我们说话之际  "锡拉"就离我们越来越远了
Scylla's slipping through our fingers as we speak.

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,960
我们和你弟弟都没有时间了
Time is not on our side, nor on your brother's.

65
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,000
你能从我这里
Now, you'll get full cooperation

66
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,800
得到全力支持
from my office.

67
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,930
需要什么帮助  就打这个号码
If you need anything, just call this number.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,960

69
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,260
化名  所有信息
Aliases, whatever you got.

70
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,360
共犯如何
How about an accomplice?

71
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,000
如果你想要
Now, if you're gonna want...

72
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,200
闭嘴
Shut up.

73
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,460
如果你告诉我他们在那里
You can save yourself a lot of pain

74
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,460
你就可以不用受苦
and the embarrassment of begging me to stop

75
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,230
也不用到时求我住手
if you just tell me where they are.

76
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,630
格雷琴和叛徒特工
Gretchen and Agent Turncoat?

77
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,830
是的
Yeah.

78
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,700
这样的情报
Information like that seems like it could be

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,730
可是有一定价值的
of a certain intrinsic value.

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,530
如果你能答应
If there were offers made,

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,630
给我点好处  我认为
carrots dangled, I could see...

82
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,430
我觉得我应该拿点好处
Look, I deserve some kind of something here,

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,160
毕竟  我也付出不少心血
all the work I put in.

84
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,260
如果不是我找到惠斯勒的书
If it wasn't for me finding Whistler's bird book then...

85
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,530
你只配给你个机会
The only thing you deserve is the opportunity

86
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
保全你的牙齿和手指甲
to keep your teeth and fingernails.

87
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,330
不  你
No. You...

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
我不会告诉你任何事情
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

89
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,930
我会把你的牙齿一颗颗拔出来
I'm gonna pull out every single tooth, every single one.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,230
怎么样
How about it?

91
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,500
我刚才只是开玩笑
Look, I was just fooling...

92
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,030
好吧
All right!

93
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,900
阿林顿码头  阿林顿码头
Arlington Pier! Arling... Arlington Pier!

94
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,400
什么时候
When? What time?

95
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,730
三点
Three o'clock.

96
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,800
这是最后一针麻醉药
This is the last of the anesthetic

97
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,230
从现在开始  你应该感觉不到任何疼痛  斯科菲尔德先生
From here on out, you shouldn't feel a thing, Mr. Scofield.

98
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,730
我会一直待在那里
I'm going to be right over there the whole time.

99
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,930
我会一直待在这里
I'll be right in here the whole time.

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
我们准备好了
We're ready.

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,260
我不会离开你的
I'm not going to leave you, okay?

102
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,260
你也不准离开我
Don't you dare leave me.

103
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
你们小组用过几次伽玛刀治疗
How many surgeries has your team performed using the gamma knife?

104
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,660
伽玛刀治疗
The gamma knife has

105
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,760
有13%的复发率
a recurrence rate of over 13 percent.

106
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,430
我们用的技术更先进
We'll be using a technique that's more advanced.

107
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,530
迈克尔怎么样了
What's going on with Michael?

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
他们马上要动手术
They're gonna operate.

109
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,060
就这样  他们答应做了
Just like that, they agreed to do that?

110
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,930
我跟他们说迈克尔知道"锡拉"买家是谁
I convinced them Michael knew who was gonna buy Scylla.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,760
我们怎么办
What are we gonna do?

112
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,230
先下手为强
Get our hands on it before they do.

113
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,500
-然后给谁  -我还在想
And give it to who? I'm still working on that.

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,830
林肯  我要知道我们要做什么
Linc, I need to know what we're doing.

115
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
-我们了结这件事  -真的吗
We finish this! Really?

116
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,960
我倒觉得我们会先完蛋
'Cause it feels like it's finishing us.

117
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,230
你和我  只剩下我们了  兄弟
You, me... we're the only ones left, bro.

118
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,700
再多一天  我们就搞定了
One more day and we're done.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
没有你  我做不到
I can't do this without you.

120
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,200
买家来了之后
When the buyer gets here,

121
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,760
由我来谈
why don't you let me do the talking.

122
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,030
为什么
For what?

123
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,130
我策划了整件事情  格雷琴
I engineered this whole thing, Gretchen.

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,430
我能自己处理
I can handle my business.

125
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,830
是吗  那你干嘛
Oh, yeah? Why don't you start

126
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,860
不先把你脑门上的汗
by handling that river of nerves

127
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,600
擦干净再说
that's running down your forehead.

128
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,700
你以为这次会更简单吗
Did you think this would be easier?

129
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,860
我想过
I hoped.

130
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,100
但我知道
But I guess I always knew

131
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,030
总会有一大堆尸体出现在面前
it was going to come down to a pile of bodies.

132
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,730
我从不认为你是个杀手
I never pegged you for a killer.

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
我也从不认为你会是母亲
Yeah, well, I never pegged you for a mom.

134
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,460
你觉得我还能是什么  唐
Is there anything that you'd like to peg me for, Don?

135
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,360
行了  别丢人现眼了
Oh, stop. Okay. Don't embarrass yourself.

136
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,860
对其他人可能有用  但是现在
That may work on everyone else, but right now,

137
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,600
我脑子里只有那1.25亿
the only thing I'm thinking about is that $125 million.

138
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,830
把你的上衣系好  睁大眼睛
So close up your blouse and open your eyes,

139
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,360
因为买家就要来了
because the buyer's on the way.

140
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,630
我可不想他来的时候  我们措手不及
And I don't want any surprises when he gets here.

141
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,160
还要多久
How much longer?

142
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,430
一小时左右  耐心坐着吧
Another hour or so. Just sit tight.

143
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,300
我要上厕所
I need to use the men's room.

144
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
好极了
Congratulations.

145
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,000
你以为我想干什么  逃跑
What do you think I'm gonna do, run?

146
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,260
我就是这么想的
That's exactly what I think you're gonna do.

147
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,100
在这你还想让我坐冷板凳吗
You want me to go in the back seat, right here?

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
你最好能尊重一下
I want you to have a little bit of respect

149
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,500
我的智商  阿历克斯
for my intelligence, Alex.

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,660
我尊重你  所以我知道你不会违反
I do, which is why I know you wouldn't violate

151
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,000
法则42-13-72B条  规定了
Code 42-13-72B, which states that an individual

152
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,500
被司法代表押送的个人
being transported by a representative

153
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,230
如果押送时间超过3小时
of the criminal justice system must be afforded the opportunity

154
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,660
必须提供
to relieve himself

155
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,960
上厕所的机会
if the duration of the transport is more than three hours.

156
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,600
我确信有那么长时间了
And I do believe we're creeping up on that time.

157
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,200
好吧  我尽量
All right, I'll see what I can do.

158
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,130
但我也要提醒你一条
But I'm going to remind you of a code.

159
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,500
如果罪犯企图在押送途中逃跑
The one that says if a prisoner attempts escape during transfer,

160
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,600
陪同的特工有权
the accompanying agent has the right to shoot them

161
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,030
在背后开枪射击
through the back of the head.

162
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,530
你确定不想再憋一会吗  阿历克斯
You sure you don't want to hold it, Alex?

163
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,860
我确定
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

164
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,600
有任何疼痛或不适吗  斯科菲尔德先生
Any pain or discomfort, Mr. Scofield?

165
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,300
没有
No.

166
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,930
那些针  是起稳定作用的吗
Those needles, they're for... stabilization?

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
不全是  手术期间  迈克尔大脑皮层的
Not exactly. Throughout the surgery, different portions

168
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,100
不同的区域会受到刺激
of Michael's cerebral cortex will be stimulated,

169
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,830
会触发控制
triggering the areas

170
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,730
听觉  嗅觉  记忆的区域
that control senses like hearing, smell, memory.

171
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,460
这就是为什么
That's why some people,

172
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,460
有些人在死之前  经常会说
right before death, often speak of...

173
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,730
人生在眼前一闪而过
Their life flashing before their eyes.

174
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
正是
Exactly.

175
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,230
如果大脑缺氧的话
When oxygen is cut off to the brain,

176
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,860
会过度工作  寻找所有资源
it kicks into overdrive, tapping into every resource

177
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,000
以维持身体运作
to continue operating the body.

178
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,660
结果就是  所有感官同时打开
As a result, all of the senses fire off at once.

179
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,900
所有你曾了解  感受  相信过的东西
Everything you've ever known, felt, believed...

180
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,260
都会从眼前闪过
it all passes in a blink of an eye.

181
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,000
你好  迈克尔
Hello Michael

182
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,330
查尔斯
Charles?

183
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,270
我觉得  你现在可以叫我DB了
I guess you can probably call me DB now.

184
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,000
答案是否定的
The answer is no.

185
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,370
答案
The answer?

186
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,400
你在想  你是不是死了
You're wondering if you're dead.

187
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,170
答案是否定的
The answer is no.

188
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,400
那我为什么在这里
Then why am I here?

189
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,700
我相信这是
I believe that's a question

190
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,730
我们都需要寻找的答案
we all need to find the answer to.

191
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,230
看来这是执法史上
This is officially now the most secure bathroom break

192
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,670
最安全的解手时间了
in the history of law enforcement.

193
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,130
确实如此
Yes, it is.

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,630
如果你想拷我  堵住所有出口
Hey, look, if you want to cuff me, block off all the exits,

195
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,800
就赶快  如果这样能让你开心的话
take it out and give it a tap, if it makes you happy.

196
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,100
你会开心吗  阿历克斯
Would that make you feel happy, Alex?

197
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,170
我听说监狱能改变人
I hear prison can change a man.

198
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,600
我们能不能赶快做正事
Can we just get this over with.

199
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,670
安全
All clear.

200
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,530
给你15秒
You have 15 seconds.

201
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,590
还行吧
Wasn't so bad now, was it?

202
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,500
你应该相信我
You should've trusted me,

203
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,770
就像我相信你一样
like I trusted you.

204
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,730
好了
All right.

205
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,930
我们可以开始隔离肿瘤了  斯科菲尔德先生
We're ready to begin to isolate the tumor now, Mr. Scofield.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,870
就像我们说过的
As we talked about,

207
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,670
我要你慢慢地背诵字母
I'm going to ask you to slowly recite the alphabet.

208
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,300
如果你想不起字母
If you have any trouble finding a letter,

209
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,830
或说不出字母
any problem saying a letter,

210
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,130
就告诉我们  好吗
you let us know. All right?

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,300
好的
All right.

212
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,200
好的
Okay.

213
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,470
准备好了吗
Ready?

214
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,930
开始
And begin.

215
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,630
对不起  查尔斯
I'm sorry, Charles.

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,830
为什么
For what?

217
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,700
一切
For everything.

218
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,800
我所说过的谎言
For all the lies I told.

219
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,430
我所造成的痛苦
For all the pain I caused.

220
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,270
你是在寻求我的宽恕吗
Are you asking for forgiveness?

221
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,670
我觉得我不配得到宽恕
I'm not sure I'm entitled to it.

222
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,030
我觉得这由不得
I guess that's for a power

223
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,330
我们决定  不是吗
higher than us to decide, isn't it?

224
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,430
我只是无法相信  我们输了
It's just hard... hard to believe we've lost,

225
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
一切都白费了
that it was all for nothing.

226
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,100
可以不必这样
It doesn't have to be.

227
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,300
看来
It looks like

228
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,300
肿瘤长到海马体后面了
the tumor is nestled behind the hippocampus.

229
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,000
你知道答案  迈克尔
You have the answers, Michael.

230
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,170
问题是什么
What are the questions?

231
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,100
我不知道  但你知道
I don't know, but you do.

232
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,570
你只是还没有意识到
You just haven't realized it yet.

233
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,930
前面右转
Up here, make a right.

234
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,570
不  左转
No, no, left, left, left.

235
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,770
我们还有10分钟  你觉得呢
We got ten minutes, what do you think?

236
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,930
有点紧
It's gonna be tight.

237
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,530
他们随时会来
All right, any minute now.

238
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,230
没看到他
There's no sign of him.

239
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,470
查一下怀肯的掌上电脑
Check Vikan's PDA.

240
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,800
看看买家有没有留消息
See if the buyer left him a message.

241
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,130
这个东西坏了
Oh, this thing is broken.

242
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,500
肯定是他摔倒时砸坏了
It must have cracked when he hit the ground.

243
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,270
还能看见号码吗
Can you still see the contact number?

244
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,630
可以  是迈阿密的区号
Yeah, it's a Miami area code.

245
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,530
读一下  我记到我手机里
Okay, read it out. I'll put it in mine.

246
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,000
不  我不会读给你的
No, no, I'm not reading out anything.

247
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,100
我暂时保留这个号码
I'm gonna keep that number

248
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,530
你不介意的话
for now, if you don't mind.

249
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,630
是谁
Who is it?

250
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,100
我姐姐
It's my sister.

251
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,870
不许接
Don't answer it.

252
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,470
我说了不许接
I said don't answer it.

253
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,800
开枪吧
Shoot me.

254
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,570
喂
Hello?

255
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,570
我们自由了
We're free.

256
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,570
他走了
He's gone.

257
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,570
什么
What?

258
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,000
那个
The... the guy

259
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,970
有只假手的人  他放了我们
with the, uh, fake hand... he let us go,

260
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,000
所以我们穿过街  跑到普特的屋子里
so we, uh... we ran across the street to the Patels' house,

261
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,630
几分钟之后  我往窗外看
and a couple minutes later, I looked out the window,

262
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,630
看到
and I saw these, uh...

263
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,430
两个人
these two guys in, uh...

264
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,100
穿着西服  把他拖进货车了
in these suits, and they, uh, dragged him off

265
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,200
行了  格雷琴  让巴格维尔接电话
into some van. All right, Gretchen, put Bagwell on the phone.

266
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,930
-他不在那  -格雷琴  我可没开玩笑
He's not there. Gretchen, I'm not playing anymore...

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,630
唐  "公司"的人抓住他了
Don, the Company took him.

268
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,470
艾米丽怎么样了
How's Emily?

269
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,800
她没事
She's... She's fine.

270
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,500
听着  格雷琴
Listen, Gretchen.

271
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,130
你得离我们远点
You need to stay away from us.

272
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,470
为了所有的人
For everyone's sake.

273
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,970
给  宝贝
Here, baby.

274
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,100
再见  阿姨
Bye, Auntie.

275
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
别管巴格维尔那个乡巴佬
Forget that hick, Bagwell.

276
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,270
不  不行
No, I can't.

277
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,900
他知道交易地点
He knows the location of the exchange.

278
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,170
如果他知道我们在这
If he knows we're here...

279
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,130
那么"公司"也知道
then the Company does, too.

280
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,830
那就是
Hey, that's it.

281
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,570
就在那  阿林顿码头
Right there-- Arlington Pier.

282
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,630
靠边停
Pull over.

283
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,370
血  兄弟
Blood, papi.

284
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,930
我们刚刚错过了
We just missed them.

285
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,900
我去附近看看
I'll go look around.

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,100
指挥部
Operations.

287
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,900
将军说  如果有需要就打这个电话
The General said to call this number if I needed help.

288
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,730
请说您的通行码
Your clearance code, please.

289
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,430
通行码
Clearance code?

290
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,730
我是林肯・布伦斯  你将失去"锡拉"如何
How about I'm Lincoln Burrows and you're about to lose Scylla?

291
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,500
通过
Proceed.

292
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,030
我要追踪这条线
I need to trace this line.

293
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,170
我们试过了
We've already tried.

294
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,400
你所在的区域
You're in a zone

295
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,730
无法进行视频监控
where visual surveillance is an impossibility.

296
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
那就在区域外
Well, how about you look

297
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,970
查找过去15分钟内
outside the zone and check for a vehicle leaving

298
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,270
离开的车辆
in the last 15 minutes.

299
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,430
如果有  核对一下  再给我电话
If you see one, get a match and call me.

300
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,700
没发现
Nothing.

301
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,170
没有痕迹  不过我找到这些
No tracks, but I found these.

302
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,230
他们知道我们在找他们
They know we're onto them.

303
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,100
我们要在他们分开前找到他们
We got to find these people before they split.

304
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,900
有人在  但不是卖方
Someone's here, but it's not the seller.

305
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,270
我该怎么做
What do you want me to do?

306
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,830
我只是很好奇  朗格
I'm just curious, Lang.

307
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,230
你什么时候决定背叛我的
When did you decide to turn your back on me?

308
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,030
估计在你决定
Probably about the same time

309
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,330
变成逃犯的同时吧
you decided to become a fugitive.

310
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,200
我没跟你说话
I wasn't talking to you.

311
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,170
我立过誓要维护法律  阿历克斯
I took an oath to uphold the law, Alex.

312
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,700
为了升职吗
Did you do it for a promotion?

313
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,130
为了抓我  他们答应你什么了
Did they promise you anything to serve me up?

314
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,230
我只想让你安全  阿历克斯
The only thing I ever wanted was your safety, Alex.

315
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,330
你逃跑时间越长
The longer you're on the run,

316
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,700
我实现目标的机会就越少
the lower my chance of getting what I want.

317
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,730
你往外看什么  阿历克斯
What you looking for out there, Alex?

318
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,070
那里
There.

319
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,770
我是惠勒特工  有个嫌疑犯
Agent Wheeler. I've got a suspect

320
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,600
在拘禁期间逃跑
fleeing custody off Route 14

321
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,000
格林伯格以南3公里14号公路
about three miles north of Greenburg.

322
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,400
请求空中支援
Requesting backup and air support.

323
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,900
我不是有意吓你
I didn't mean to startle you.

324
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,700
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

325
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,430
客户服务
Customer service.

326
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,070
质量控制
Quality control.

327
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,800
我希望能掌控一切
I like to keep a hand in all our theaters of engagement.

328
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,770
说得就像个军人
Spoken like a military man.

329
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,800
把人命看得跟演戏一样简单
So easy to discuss lives in the balance when it's just theater.

330
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,930
我很欣赏你的忠诚  莎拉
I admire your devotion, Sara.

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,470
我最看重这个
It's an attribute I value above all others,

332
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,370
但我想知道
but I wonder...

333
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,970
你忠诚的是信仰
is it the cause

334
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,430
还是这个人
you believe in or the man?

335
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,130
我是说  你是个空想家呢
I mean, are you an ideologue

336
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,400
或者只是个难得有人垂青就死缠烂打
or just a silly schoolgirl following the brooding boy

337
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,600
的傻女学生
who finally noticed her?

338
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,130
我是个寻找
I'm the girl whose father was murdered,

339
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,230
谋杀我父亲的混蛋的女生
who's looking for the bastard responsible.

340
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,500
你希望我打几个电话
Would you like me to make a few phone calls,

341
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,170
看能否帮你
see if I can point you

342
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,900
指点迷津
in the right direction?

343
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,600
你放心  他接受的
You can relax, he's receiving

344
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,730
是最好的治疗
the best possible care.

345
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
是吗
Is he?

346
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,700
因为我从没看到这种仪器
Because I've never seen this equipment before,

347
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,470
也从没见过这种方式
and I've never seen this procedure.

348
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,830
这是实验性的  对吗
It's experimental, isn't it?

349
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,270
可以这么说  但以前用过一次
Well, you could say that, but it has been used once before.

350
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,900
那个病人活了多久
How long did the patient live?

351
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,230
唐克雷蒂医生
Dr. Tancredi,

352
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,100
我知道你怎么看我们的做法  但是记住
I know your opinion of the work we do here, but know this.

353
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,170
要看事情的本质
Not everything is as it seems.

354
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,800
而且  这个手术
And for what it's worth,

355
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,500
让那个病人过得很好  很久
the patient lived a long, happy life.

356
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,670
你在干什么
What are you doing?

357
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,770
结构工程师的责任是
It is the job of a structural engineer

358
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,930
让他所有创造的东西
to make sure everything he creates is designed

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,930
能承受附加在上面的重量
to withstand the weight placed upon it.

360
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,470
我在这建造的
What I've built here...

361
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,570
不够牢固
does not hold up.

362
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
如果你发现
If you discovered

363
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,700
你建造的东西有缺陷
that a structure you built was deficient,

364
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,830
你会拆了它
would you tear down the building

365
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,800
还是设法修整它
or find a way to fix it?

366
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,170
我试过修整
I've tried to fix it.

367
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,770
我试过让事情按部就班
I've tried to make things right.

368
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,970
但我做的只是加大重量
All I've done is add more weight to it.

369
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,430
现在
And now...

370
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,900
我也承受不住了
...now I can't take anymore.

371
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,930
我想做的只是救我哥哥
All I wanted to do was save my brother's life.

372
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,900
你做到了吗
Did you do that?

373
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,030
是的
Yes...

374
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,930
但是有多少人
but how many other people

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,330
为了这件事而失去生命
lost their lives in the process?

376
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,770
现在知道了
Knowing that now,

377
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,530
你还会让他死吗
would you have let him die?

378
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,000
不会
No.

379
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,870
因此你觉得自己是个杀人凶手吗
And that makes you feel like some kind of murderer?

380
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,530
可能吧
Perhaps.

381
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,200
杀十个人  你是个连环杀手
Take ten lives, you're a serial killer.

382
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,230
杀一千个人  你就是战争英雄
Take thousands, you're a war hero.

383
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,700
这不是战争
This isn't war.

384
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,400
你确定吗
Are you sure?

385
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,070
只不过是"公司"的小黑名单而已
There's nothing more than the Company's little black book.

386
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,870
名字  数字  行动报告
Names, numbers, operation reports.

387
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,570
事情不能只看表面  迈克尔
Not everything is as it seems, Michael.

388
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,200
但你知道
But you know that...

389
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,730
不是吗
don't you?

390
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,670
好了  我们得和买家
All right, look, we need to reestablish contact

391
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,730
重新取得联系  告诉他发生了什么事
with the buyer, explain to him what happened,

392
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,900
重新选个交易地点
and then set a new location for the exchange.

393
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,600
我得说
I got to say...

394
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,900
我很惊讶  唐
I'm amazed at you, Don.

395
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,170
那么长时间  你从没想过了解
Yeah, all this time, and you never once asked to see

396
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,300
-"锡拉"里的信息  -因为我不在乎信息
the information in Scylla. That's 'cause I don't care

397
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,130
我只关心它的价值
about the information; I just care what it's worth.

398
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,470
也许你担心  要是知道里面的信息后
Maybe you're just worried if you actually knew what was on it,

399
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,370
你会想  买家是什么样的人
you'd have second thoughts about who you're selling it to.

400
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,430
喂
Hello?

401
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,700
布伦斯先生  我们有目标的情况
Mr. Burrows, we have a hit on the targets.

402
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,600
路况监视器显示他们进了一家便利店
Traffic camera picked them up entering a convenience store

403
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,870
在威利街14号
on Valley and 14th.

404
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,300
看来他们留下蛛丝马迹了
Looks like they left a footprint.

405
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,200
不许动
Don't move.

406
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,800
干得不错  朗格特工
That's a hell of a job, Agent Lang.

407
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,530
是你教我如何看穿
You're the one who taught me how to read the mind

408
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,730
逃犯的思想  记得吗
of a convict on the run, remember?

409
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,700
如果你把我带走  我就是死路一条
If you take me in, I'm as good as dead.

410
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,700
你知道的
You know that.

411
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,130
所以
So...

412
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,170
我现在要逃走了
I'm gonna run now.

413
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,930
如果你要阻拦我
And if you need to stop me,

414
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,370
你就必须杀掉我
you're gonna have to shoot.

415
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,170
别逼我
Don't make me do this.

416
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,970
对不起
I'm sorry.

417
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,930
他时他方再见  费丽舍
Another time, another place, eh, Felicia?

418
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,700
我会扣下扳机
I will pull this trigger.

419
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,030
发生什么了
What happened?

420
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,030
他跑了
He got away.

421
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,300
你看到他了吗
Did you have him?

422
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,300
我
Uh, yeah, I...

423
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,030
我以为看到他了
I thought I had him unless I...

424
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,530
但是跟丢了
I just missed.

425
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,830
你看到他往哪跑了吗
Did you see which way he went?

426
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,200
还是连这个也跟丢了
Or did you just miss that, too?

427
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,030
他朝东去了
He went east.

428
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,460
-伙计  -怎么了
Hey, buddy. What's up?

429
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,530
我在找一名高个黑色头发的女人
I'm looking for a, a tall chick with black hair

430
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,700
一个男人  高个
and a guy-- tall guy, uh...

431
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,400
看上去就像波仔小丑
He looks like Bozo the clown.

432
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,660
你知道波仔和埃尔韦拉吗
You know, Bozo and Elvira?

433
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,830
你们
You guys

434
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,260
是警察还是什么
cops or somethin'?

435
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,360
不是
Not even close.

436
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,230
有印象吗
So how 'bout it?

437
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,530
我不记得见过这些人
I don't remember anyone like that.

438
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,130
现在呢  臭小子
How 'bout now, you punk?

439
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,460
-现在呢  -好的  我说
-How 'bout now?! -Okay! Okay!

440
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,800
他们买了个手机
They bought a phone, man.

441
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,030
给我收据
I want the receipt.

442
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,060
好的
All right.

443
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,660
他们在路上
On their way.

444
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,400
你知道买家是谁吗
You have any idea who the buyer is?

445
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,960
不知道  也永远不会知道
No. And we never will.

446
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,130
任何想盗取"锡拉"里的信息的人
Whoever's walking away with the information that's on Scylla

447
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,460
都会不惜一切
will do whatever it takes

448
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,460
避开公司的雷达
to stay below The Company radar.

449
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,460
而且  你要是搞了别人的老婆
Besides, would you screw some guy's wife

450
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,100
会把名片放在他的枕头上吗
and then leave your card on his pillow?

451
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,100
你不就是这么对将军的嘛
Isn't that what you just did to the General?

452
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,260
说嘛
Come on.

453
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,500
我们经历了这么多
After all we've been through,

454
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,960
就不能互相坦诚吗
we can't be honest with each other?

455
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,430
你的小照片
Your little photo shoot.

456
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,460
还有想偷第6张卡的馊主意
And your weak ass attempt at the sixth card.

457
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,600
你就想让他知道你参与了  对吧
You wanted him to know you were involved, right?

458
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,600
说吧  他惩罚过你
Come on. He punished you,

459
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,060
对待垃圾一样对你  就像你父亲那样
treated you like crap-- just like your real daddy.

460
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,900
你希望至少其中一人付出代价  不是吗
You want at least one of them to pay for it, right?

461
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,900
说吧  格雷琴
Come on, Gretchen.

462
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,060
我了解你
I-I know you.

463
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,460
我查了很多资料
I did my homework.

464
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,730
天啊  唐  你
Gee, Don, you...

465
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,760
你完全挖出了我的恋父情结啊  厉害
you just cracked my whole Electra complex wide open.Kudos.

466
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,800
但并不是只有你一个人查了资料
But you're not the only one who did their homework.

467
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,130
只是想让你知道
Just so you know.

468
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,960
-是吗  你还想说什么  -现在
-Yeah? You got something to say? -Right now,

469
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,760
我们得为即将来临的一切做好准备
we need to be ready for whatever's coming.

470
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,530
你最好眼观六路  唐
You better watch your six, Don.

471
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,560
好的
Okay.

472
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,100
-你找我吗  -是的
-You wanted to see me? -Yeah.

473
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,700
我从显示器上没看明白
I-I can't quite tell from the monitors,

474
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,260
但我觉得那个肿瘤
but from what I can see, the-the growth,

475
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,000
看起来并不只是在下丘脑
it looks like it isn't just on the hypothalamus.

476
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,230
我知道这只是初步诊断
I understand that was the initial diagnosis,

477
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,100
但是进入里面后  发现也扩散到
but once we got in there, it appears to have spread

478
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,100
海马体了
to the hippocampus as well.

479
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,430
好的
Okay. Um,

480
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,300
如果肿瘤切除后  会丧失记忆吗
so with the removal, will there be any memory loss?

481
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,100
像这种情况
Well, in cases like this,

482
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,330
有小部分组织必须移除
where small portions have to be removed,

483
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
但基本不会影响到大部分记忆
it hardly ever affects what's referred to as "net memory."

484
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,060
我们将一生的经历
We're all tapped into such small portions

485
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,700
都储存在这一小部分
of what we've experienced in our lifetime.

486
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,200
大部分只是储存在里面
The bulk of it's just kept in storage,

487
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,300
很少被意识所承认
rarely acknowledged by the conscious mind.

488
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,330
所以即使有部分记忆丧失
So while there may be some gross memory loss,

489
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,860
他也不会知道
he won't ever know it's gone.

490
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,030
因为他根本不知道那些记忆的存在
Because he'll never know it was there.

491
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,330
护士
Nurse?

492
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,030
血压在下降  90/60
BP's dropping, 90/60.

493
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,930
怎么回事
What's going on?

494
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
我不知道
I don't know.

495
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,430
把多巴胺的输液速度调到12.5
Increase dopamine delivery rate to 12.5.

496
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,660
时机成熟了  我们再用"交易"
We'll use the Bargain when the time is right.

497
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,700
现在就是最好的时机
The time is now.

498
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,700
"交易"  "交易"
Bargain. Bargain.

499
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,500
时机成熟  再用
We'll use time--  time is right.

500
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,100
时机成熟了  我们再用"交易"
We'll use the Bargain when the time is right.

501
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,430
或许现在就是最好的时机
perhaps the time is now.

502
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,960
脑电图达到峰值
EEG's spiking.

503
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,060
大脑活动异常
Brain activity's all over the place.

504
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,600
动脉压值55
MAP's at 55.

505
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,030
血压不稳定  在下降
BP's erratic. Dropping.

506
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,460
85  84
85, 84.

507
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,100
给他注射1毫升阿托品  迈克尔
Give him one mil of Atropine. Michael?

508
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,460
能听见我们说话吗
Are you still with us?

509
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,860
由世上最聪明的人设计出的安全系统
The best minds in the world designed this system,

510
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,060
你几乎把它打破了
and you almost beat it.

511
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,900
但只要我们有
But as long as we have...

512
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,230
但只要我们有
...we have-- as long as we...

513
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,160
你听说
So what are you hearing, uh,

514
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,000
锡拉价值多少
Scylla's worth?

515
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,330
我听说值上百万
Me, I'm hearing millions.

516
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,230
前几天
Things have happened

517
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,600
发生的事
in the past few days that

518
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,130
让我感觉不安
have made me uneasy.

519
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,660
但只要我们有"锡拉"  我们就有"力量"
But as long as we have Scylla,  we have power.

520
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,160
很抱歉  迈克尔
I'm sorry, Michael.

521
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,330
他快不行了  78  急救
We're losing him. 78. Get the crash cart.

522
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,130
-喉镜  得插管  -不
Laryngeal scope. we need to intubate. No.

523
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,500
怎么了
What's going on?

524
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,960
该走了
It's time to go.

525
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,630
迈克尔
Michael?

526
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,460
迈克尔
Michael?!

527
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,470
迈克尔  怎么回事  他怎么会这样
Michael! What's going on? Why's he crashing?

528
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,240
唐克雷蒂小姐  你不能
Ms. Tancredi, you cannot...

529
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,940
没事  没关系
No, it's okay.

530
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,440
迈克尔  别这样
Michael, don't do this.

531
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,070
不要这样
Don't do this.

532
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,100
不要这样
Don't do this.

533
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,140
不要离开
Don't go.

534
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,600
我们还没完成呢
We're not finished with this.

535
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,940
还没完成呢
Not finished yet.

536
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,200
迈克尔  对不起
Michael, I'm sorry.

537
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,240
是时候了
It's time.

538
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,140
求你了  查尔斯
Please, Charles.

539
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,440
迈克尔  别这样
Michael, not like this.

540
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,570
别这样
Not like this.

541
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,840
不能这样
It doesn't happen like this.

542
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,440
你答应过我要一起完成的
You promised me we would finish together.

543
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
没关系
It's okay.

544
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,270
你已经完成了你该做的
You've done your part.

545
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,770
我还没弄明白呢
I haven't figured it out yet!

546
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,440
你已经弄明白了
Yes, you have.

547
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,800
你能做点什么吗
Would you do something?

548
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,000
我在努力
I'm trying!

549
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,340
放松点
Relax.

550
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,970
你可能认为这不好
You might think it's bad,

551
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,770
实际上不是的
but it's not.

552
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
死亡
Dying?

553
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,740
不是
No!

554
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,600
不要放弃
Don't give up.

555
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,770
不要放弃
Don't give up.

556
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,900
不要放弃
Don't give up.

557
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,400
事情不能只看表面
Not everything is as it seems.

558
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,370
再见  迈克尔
Good-bye, Michael.

559
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,540
查尔斯
Charles.

560
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,840
迈克尔
Michael?

561
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,170
迈克尔  不要离开我
Michael, don't leave me.

562
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
你也不准离开我
Don't you dare leave me.

563
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,570
莎拉
Sara.

564
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,640
公司追踪了收据上的序列号
Company tracked the serial code off the receipt.

565
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,600
格雷琴五分钟前打了一个电话
Gretchen just placed a call five minutes ago

566
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,270
-序列号相符  -在哪打的
matching the tracking number. From where?

567
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,370
两英里外
Two miles away.

568
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,970
据我所知  你们应该有三个人
I was told there'd be three of you.

569
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,270
现在没有了
Well there aren't.

570
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,270
你拿了钱吗  那么小的盒子
You have the money? Because that's a small case

571
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,270
-可装不了1.25亿  -我们不用现金交易
for $125 million... We don't deal in cash.

572
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,300
一旦我确定东西是真的
Once I verify the validity of the item,

573
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,800
钱就会打到你提供的账户上
the funds will be wired to an account number you provide.

574
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,170
请把东西拿出来
The item, please.

575
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,300
不行  我看不到钱
No, no, no, you're not gonna see the item

576
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,240
你就不能看东西
until I see the money, okay? You'll have to

577
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,970
恕我不能相信一个有几个按钮的亮盒子
forgive me if I don't trust a shiny case with some buttons.

578
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,270
我要确定数据是否完整
I need to confirm that the data is intact.

579
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,270
不然的话  你手里的东西
Without it, the item you possess

580
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,600
不过也就是个靓盒子
is nothing more than a fancy box.

581
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,670
谈到这点
Speaking of...

582
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,240
把东西给他
Give this man the item.

583
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,740
不  我谁也不给
No, I'm not giving anyone...

584
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
他是个商人
This is a businessman

585
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,070
在做商务交易
making a business transaction.

586
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,640
你拖的时间越长
One with the longer you take,

587
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,140
我们就越危险
the more danger you put us all in.

588
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,340
你能读出里面的数据吗
Can you read what's on there?

589
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,470
最好是这样
You better hope so.

590
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,400
他们不会轻易把锡拉给我们的
They're not just gonna give us Scylla.

591
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,540
你应该明白吧
You know what that means, right?

592
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,770
我们分头行动
Let's split up.

593
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,450
看上去不像"公司"的黑名单
That doesn't look like a company's black book.it's...

594
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,630
更像是
It looks more like a...

595
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,000
我确信你们明白
I'm sure you understand

596
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,100
不能让人知道"锡拉"的去向
no one can know where Scylla's going to.

597
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,370
算你走运  甜心
It's your lucky day, sugar.

598
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
你可不走运
Not yours.

599
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,240
放下枪
Drop it.

600
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,800
看住她
Cover her.

601
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,400
-他在哪  -我不知道
Where is he? I don't know.

602
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,870
他在哪
Where is he?

603
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,440
-我不知道  -跑了
I don't know!  Gone.

604
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,600
"锡拉"被偷了
Stolen.

605
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,600
谁干的
By who?

606
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,440
谁
By who?

607
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,470
我要是死了  你永远都别想知道
If I die... you'll never know.

608
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,270
你真漂亮
You look beautiful.

609
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,100
撒谎
You're a liar.

610
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,070
怎么样了
How'd it go?

611
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,170
他们还在做一些测试
They're still running some tests,

612
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,770
不过他们确信已经搞定了
but they feel pretty confident they got it all.

613
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,230
这是哪
And what is this place?

614
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,070
你得了解一下你的手术
You need to know something about your surgery.

615
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,170
手术是"公司"的医生做的
It was performed by Company doctors,

616
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,570
将军安排了这一切
and the General made all the arrangements.

617
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,830
为什么
Why?

618
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,300
我不知道
I don't know.

619
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,100
林肯在处理这件事
Lincoln's handling it.

620
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,400
他说他有个计划
He says he has a plan.

621
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,670
说实话  我唯一关心的
I'll be honest. Right now, you're alive,

622
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,070
就是现在你还活着
and that's all I care about.

623
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,930
你肯定会笑的  我做了个有关"锡拉"的梦
You're gonna laugh, but I had a dream about Scylla.

624
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,770
我们了解的只是赛尔夫的片面之词
The only thing we really know about it is what Self told us.

625
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,030
你需要休息
You need to rest.

626
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,800
我是认真的
I'm serious.

627
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,030
如果它不只是"公司"的黑皮书呢
What if it's not just the Company's little black book?

628
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,230
万一是
What if it's...

629
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,430
事情不能只看表面
Not everything is as it seems.

630
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,070
别的什么呢
...something more?

631
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,970
比如
Like what?

632
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,070
一些好的东西
Something good.

633
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,570
为什么要费这么大周折
Why go to so much trouble

634
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,570
保护过去的信息
to protect information about the past,

635
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,930
"公司"随时都可以
information the Company could just delete

636
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,930
删除这些信息
any time they wanted to?

637
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,730
将军说
The General said...

638
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,970
只要我们有"锡拉"  我们就有"力量"
As long as we have Scylla, we have power.

639
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,300
我认为他说的力量
I don't think he was talking about power

640
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,870
并不是控制或影响
like control or influence.

641
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,930
我觉得他说的是能源
I think he was talking about energy.

642
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,970
硼
Boron.

643
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,300
氩
Argon.

644
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,800
镓
Gallium.

645
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,530
铟
Indium.

646
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,000
交易
Bargain.

647
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,070
理论上而言  如果有办法
There's a theory that if you can find a way

648
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,800
把这些元素结合到太阳能电池设计中
to combine these elements into the design of a solar cell,

649
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,830
就能百分之百地利用太阳能
you can harness 100% of the sun's energy.

650
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,600
一旦拥有这种能量
With that kind of power,

651
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,970
没有什么是不可能的
possibilities are limitless.

652
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,300
这就是为什么"锡拉"会受到重重保护
It would certainly explain all the security around Scylla.

653
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,970
他们不是保护过去
They're not protecting the past.

654
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,400
而是为了保护未来
They're protecting the future.

655
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,070
真不知道还有什么
Wonder what else is on it.

656
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,300
我是说  他们为你提供的医疗设备
I mean, the equipment you were treated with,

657
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,870
还有药物
and the drugs they gave you.

658
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,330
都是在公共市场买不到的
none of it exists on the open market.

659
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,430
所以才会有人愿意
Which would explain why some people are willing

660
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,670
支付数百万以获得"锡拉"
to pay hundreds of millions to get their hands on Scylla.

661
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,500
他们不是为了搞垮"公司"
It's not about taking down the Company.

662
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,700
而是
It's about

663
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,030
想成为"公司"
becoming the Company.

664
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,370
他们想了解一切
It's about knowing what they know,

665
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,530
控制一切
controlling what they know.

666
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,370
我们该怎么办
What do we do now?

667
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,170
下一步计划是什么
So, what's the next move?

668
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,570
我先去看迈克尔
I'm gonna check on Michael.

669
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,230
不  我是说  在那之后
No, I mean, after that.

670
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,800
我是说  "锡拉"在某处
I mean, Scylla's out there somewhere.

671
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,630
我们真的要继续寻找它的下落吗
Are we really gonna keep chasing it?

672
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,770
我不知道  以后再说
I don't know. We'll figure it out later.

673
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,870
不
No.

674
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,570
我不会来了  林肯
I won't be here, Linc.

675
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,100
我不能再这么做了
I can't do it anymore.

676
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,070
莎拉说迈克尔已经没事了
Sara said Mike was okay,

677
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,270
我只关心这个问题
and that's all I needed to know.

678
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,900
但是我有自己的生活
But now I got to go live my life.

679
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,800
不用整天看见别人死去
And that's a life where I can go a day without seeing

680
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,230
甚至自己都死了
a dead body, or-or almost becoming one.

681
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,400
我不是想逃避  哥们
I'm not running away, papi.

682
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,900
我只是想继续生活
I'm-I'm just... I'm just moving on.

683
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,200
这本来就与你无关
This was never about you.

684
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,570
你为我们做的一切
Everything you did, you did for us.

685
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,730
我此生难忘
I'll never forget that.

686
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,070
我知道
I know you got

687
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,370
你有要事在身
something cooking, so...

688
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,970
无论如何  小心点  好吗
whatever it is, just be careful, okay?

689
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,800
好
Yeah.

690
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,330
谢谢
Thank you.

691
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,100
等你和迈克尔安顿下来
And when you and Mike get down below

692
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,270
开一家冲浪店
and open that surf shop...

693
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,600
潜水店
Scuba shop.

694
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,100
潜水店
Scuba shop.

695
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,600
要招人时记得叫我
Maybe there will be a job there for me.

696
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,800
没问题
You can count on it.

697
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,570
你知道谁拿走了"锡拉"吗
Do you know who took it?

698
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,300
不  但赛尔夫和格雷琴知道
No, but Self and Gretchen do.

699
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,570
好
Good.

700
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,870
你有合作伙伴了
Then you've got your team.

701
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,900
我不会为他们卖命的
I'm not working for them.

702
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,830
我得对我的命令
You'll work with a basset hound in a birthday hat

703
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,400
唯命是从
if that's what I tell you to do.

704
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,400
这是一个雇员的职责所在
That's what being an employee means.

705
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,230
你必须接受命令并全力以赴
You're determined and dedicated.

706
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,100
但是你简历中的空白
But there are holes in your resume

707
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,000
格雷琴或赛尔夫  甚至巴格维尔都能填补
that Gretchen or Self or even Bagwell can fill.

708
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,570
你们都从我这儿拿了东西
Now, you all took something from me,

709
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,400
你们必须物归原主
and you're all going to get it back.

710
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,400
而且
Besides...

711
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,430
你一个人是搞不定的
you can't handle this by yourself.

712
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,800
我觉得你应该知道
And deep down, I think you know that.

713
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,300
让他们在外面等我吧
Have them meet me outside.

714
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,770
谁知道呢
Who knows?

715
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,170
你可能会喜欢上这里
You may find that you like it here.

716
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,770
怪事接踵而至
Stranger things have happened.

717
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,270
在你家都发生过
They've certainly happened in your family.

718
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,970
现在
Now,

719
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,600
关于迈克尔
about Michael.

720
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,930
你会告诉他吗
Are you going to tell him,

721
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
还是我去
or should I?

722
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,270
你拿到了吗
Do you have it?

723
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,770
拿到了
In my hand.

724
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,930
好  你知道该怎么做
Good. You know what to do.

725
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,600
我上次去医院看你
Last time I saw you in a hospital,

726
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,070
是在少年棒球队时  你弄伤了胳膊
you busted your arm in Little League.

727
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,970
是的  滑二垒时
Yeah, some bruiser knocked me down

728
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,170
几条大汉把我撩倒了
sliding into second.

729
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,330
真遗憾
Sorry about that.

730
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,530
但你恢复得很好  对吧
But you healed good, though, right?

731
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,230
是的
Yeah.

732
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,030
这次也一样
This will, too.

733
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,030
无论你有什么计划
Look, whatever plan you're working on

734
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,570
把我们从这弄出去  我们最好有所行动
to get us out of here, we better make a move on it.

735
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,700
你出不去了  迈克尔
You're not getting out of here, Michael.

736
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,230
什么意思
What do you mean?

737
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,530
我做了个交易
I made a deal.

738
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,430
用"锡拉"换回你的命
Your life in exchange for Scylla.

739
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,700
你为什么这么做
Why would you do that?

740
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,770
就像当初你刺满纹身
Same reason you covered your body in tattoos

741
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,330
入狱救我一样
and-and broke into Fox River.

742
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,200
这事不仅关乎你我
This is not just about us...

743
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,600
就是我们的事  一直如此
That's exactly who it's about. It's all it's ever been about.

744
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,730
我们为"公司"摆平这件事
We do this one thing for the Company,

745
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,630
然后我们重获新生
then they set us up for life.

746
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,130
你真的相信他们吗
And you actually trust them?

747
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,130
我还能信谁
Who else am I gonna trust?

748
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,130
政府  唐・赛尔夫那种人
The government? Guys like Don Self?

749
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,500
我不想再看到挚爱亲朋离去  迈克尔
I'm done watching loved ones and friends die, Michael.

750
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,070
"锡拉"并非我们所想的那样
Scylla isn't what we thought it was.

751
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,770
-完全不同  -我不在乎
Not even close. I don't care.

752
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,900
我不明白你怎么这么说
I don't understand how you can say that.

753
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,200
因为唯一值得打拼的是家庭
'Cause the only thing worth fighting for is family.

754
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,270
我会尽一切努力结束这一切
I'm gonna do everything and anything I can to end this,

755
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,900
你  我  所有人
so you, me, all of us

756
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,430
才能继续我们的生活
can get on with our lives.

757
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,930
就凭你对"公司"的了解
You think you can do that

758
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,630
你以为你能做到吗
knowing what you know about the Company?

759
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,630
你想知道我对公司的了解吗
You want to know what I know about the Company?

760
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,100
妈妈生前一直为他们卖命
Mom worked for them before she died.

761
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,730
我只是继承家族事业
I'm just moving on in the family business.

762
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,930
林肯  别这么做
Linc, don't do this.

763
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,930
已经说定了
It's done.

764
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,900
林肯  林肯
Linc? Linc!
