我叫迈克尔・斯科菲尔德  我是一名逃犯
My name is Michael Scofield, I am a fugitive.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,190
三周前  我被关在巴拿马的一所监狱里
Three weeks ago, I was incarcerated In a Panamanian prison.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,850
在那里...
While I was there...

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,250
公司找到了我
I was approached by the Company...

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,820
公司是一个腐败堕落的...
The company is a corrupt organization...

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,350
渗透到行业和政府中各个层面的组织
Involved in all levels of industry and government.

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,150
他们给了我两个选择

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,840
帮助他们的人詹姆斯・惠斯勒越狱
Break one of their men. James Whistler out of that prison.

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,240
否则就杀了我最爱的女人

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,470
莎拉・唐克雷蒂医生
Dr. Sara Tancredi.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,020
我遵守了承诺  帮助惠斯勒成功越狱
I held up my end of deal and I broke Whistler out.

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,690
但公司...
But the Company...

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,190
还是杀了莎拉
They killed Sara anyway.

16
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,190
我不知为何公司要詹姆斯・惠斯勒越狱
I don't know why the Company wanted James Whistler out of prison.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,050
但我跟踪他来到了洛杉矶
But I've tracked him here to Los Angeles.

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,350
他和一位叫格雷琴的公司的特工在一起
He's with an another company agent I know only as Gretchen.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,990
就是杀害莎拉的那位特工
The same agent who murdered Sara.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,150
这一切要在今天了结
This ends today.

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,750
我来这里寻求公正
I came here seeking justice.

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,290
当前司法系统无法提供的公正
The justice that I now know the system cannot provide.

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,490
所以如果你在读这封信的话...
So if you're reading this letter...

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,220
你就明白我为给莎拉报仇在所不惜
You'll know I died avenging Sara's death.

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,460
拿到数据卡之后
You get the data card.

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,020
我们立即把卡送达  然后马上离开
We drop it off in the racing form, and we get the hell out of there.

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,260
我们要把它交给谁
Who's the contact we're leaving it for?

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,760
公司要拿回数据卡  就这样
The Company wants the card back, period.

你不用担心
Don't you worry about that.

33
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,860
只要你们尽快回来就行
You worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,760
如果你做成这件事  可以到我的房间...
If you pull this off, you can come up to my room later...

35
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,460
我是绝对不会拒绝的

竞争对手

48
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,260

很快回来
Be right back.

54
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,790
这块小塑料卡里有很多秘密

公司为了夺回它会不惜一切代价

59
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,260
我难道不知道吗

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,660

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,980
我们得马上离开这里

62
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,360
我要把枪藏好
I need to hide the gun.

63
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,250
把枪带在身上
Take the gun with you!

64
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,250
快呀
Come on.

65
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,350
她在哪
Where is she?

66
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,180
迈克尔  你不明白
Michael, you don't understand.

67
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,210
给格雷琴打电话  让她马上来这儿
Call Gretchen, get her in here now.

68

你得相信我

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,350
我不是你的敌人  迈克尔
I'm not your enemy, Michael.

70
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,750
詹姆斯

我们得快离开
We need to leave.

72

知道吗  无论如何...
You know, despite everything...

73
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,450
即使现在莎拉还活着 她也会让我别杀你
If Sara could weigh in right now. She'd tell me not to kill you.

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,650
她就是这样的人
That's the kind of person she was.

75
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,310
你就是把这样的人从我身边夺走了
That's the kind of person you took from me.

76
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,650
詹姆斯  难道你没告诉他吗
James, didn't you tell him?

77
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,250
-他刚刚才...  -闭嘴
-He walked in five... -Shut up!

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,580
格雷琴  看着我

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,350
这个为了莎拉
This is for Sara.

80
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,750
我没杀莎拉
I never killed Sara.

81
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,650
我就知道你这样的人是不会坦然承认的
I wouldn't expect someone like you to take this with dignity.

82
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,160
我发誓她还活着
I swear to God she's alive.

83
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,450
别侮辱我  也别侮辱她
Don't insult me and don't insult her.

84
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,910
她逃掉了
She escaped.

85
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,350
我们清楚如果你知道  我们就没有任何筹码了
We knew if you found out we wouldn't have any leverage.

86
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,450
我编造了整件事
I fabricated the whole thing.

87
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,260
我哥哥看到了...
My brother saw... 

88

箱子里的人头 是另一具尸体上的

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,750
-听她说  迈克尔  -别对我撒谎

91
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,280
我没撒谎  林肯上当了
I'm not lying to you. Lincoln bought it...

92
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,180
你也上当了  骗局成功了
You bought it, it worked.

93
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,180
迈克尔
Michael.

94
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,450
那她在哪
Then where is she?

95
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,980
我们出去后  我就告诉你
I'll tell you when we get outside.

96
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,080
现在  我们要先离开这里
Right now, we need to get out of here.

97
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,280
他们发现尸体了

98
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,750
-把枪给我  -她在撒谎
-Give me the gun. -She's lying.

99
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,910
是吗
Is she?

100
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,780
如果你扣动扳机  就永远不会知道答案了
If you pull that trigger, you'll never know.

101
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,710
杀了他  詹姆斯
Kill him, James.

102
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,780
闭嘴
Shut up.

103
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,010
她在哪
Where is she?

104
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,550
莎拉在哪
Where is Sara.

105
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,080
迈克尔
Michael.

106
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,210
如果你不把枪给我
If you don't give me that gun.

107
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,210
我就打爆你的头
I'm going to shoot you in the head.

108
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,830
我们走
Let's go.

109
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,630
我们在罗斯福酒店发现两具尸体
We got a double homicide at the Roosevelt Hotel.

110
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,490
莎拉
Sara

111
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,730
莫哈维沙漠  加州
Mojave desert, california.

112
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,390
你知道完美成功的行动和失败的行动...
Do you know the difference between a perfectly executed operation...

113
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,190
之间的区别吗
And a failed mission?

114
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,650
-长官  -取决于小团队的领导力
-Sir? -It's small unit leadership.

115
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,490
盟军用了两年半时间...
The Allies spent two and a half years...

116
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,550
策划进攻诺曼底
Planning the invasion of Normandy.

117
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,490
但在登陆日那天  一排滩头上的...
But on D-Day it came down to a handful of men...

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,820
一小股部队...
On a strip of beach...

119
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,250
来决定整个世界的命运
To decide the fate of the world.

120
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,760
格雷琴  我想说的是...
What I'm getting at, Gretchen...

121
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,420
即便是最好的计划...
Is even the best plan is only as good...

122
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,290
也需要有人去执行才会成功
As the moving parts on the ground executing it.

123
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,560
-将军  我们拿到了数据卡  -有什么问题吗
-General, we got your card. -what's the problem?

124
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,820
我们什么都没拿到  这是赝品
We have nothing. It's a duplicate.

125
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,220
几乎一模一样  但是个赝品
Almost flawless, but a duplicate.

126
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,560
这不可能  我看到...
That's impossible, I saw...

127
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,360
你知道夺回数据卡对我来说...
You know how important the retrieval of this card...

128
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,120
有多重要  格雷琴
Is to me, Gretchen.

129
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,960
你知道这是一个很可能...
You know that this is a security breach...

130
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,960
对公司产生灾难性的后果的安全隐患
that could have catastrophic ramifications for the Company.

131
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,420
我想唯一的可能就是...
The only thing I can think of...

132
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,720
当惠斯勒灭口的时候  有段时间可以做手脚
There was a blind spot when Whistler was hitting the target.

133
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,590
他可能复制了一份  并且还保留着原件
Maybe he made a duplicate and he still has the original.

134
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,390
你雇用了他
You hired him.

135
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,930
你对他委以重任
You kept him at the tip of the spear.

136
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,490
你坚持要把他从索纳监狱捞出来
You insisted that we get him out of Sona.

137
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,960
我们别无选择
We had to.

138
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,060
他当时已经和目标联系上
He had already made contact with the target.

139
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,190
当时  他是唯一的选择  长官
At that point, it was him or no one, sir.

140
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,790
你能从这件事中得到什么好处
What's your stake in all of this?

141
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,730
这件事与我无关  是惠斯勒一手策划的
I had nothing to do with it, Whistler acted on his own.

142
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,090
我向你发誓
I swear to you.

143
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,790
将军  我会补救的
General, I can fix this.

144
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,330
你训练了我
You trained me.

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,860
显然训练的不够好
Not well enough, apparently.

146
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,860
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

147
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,760
求求你
Please.

148
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,760
我在迪拜有一个帐户
I have a bank account in Dubai.

149
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,530
存有眼镜蛇2次行动中的贿金  是你的了
Left over from a slush fund from COBRA II, it's yours.

150
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,860
不  求求你  求求你
No, please, please.

151
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,860
巴拿马城  巴拿马
Panama City, Panama.

152
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,230
你好
Hello.

153
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,490
是我
Hey, it's me.

154
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,760
你在哪  兄弟
Where are you, man?

155
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,930
洛杉矶
Los Angeles.

156
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,930
你还好吗  迈克尔
You okay, Michael?

157
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,530
是的  我很安全
No, I'm, I'm safe.

158
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,360
谢天谢地
Thank God, thank God.

159
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,130
LJ和索菲亚怎么样
How's LJ and Sofia?

160
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,290
他们...我正看着他们呢
Yeah, they're...I'm staring at them right now in fact.

161
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,990
他们很好
They're fine.

162
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,230
听说索纳监狱的事了吗
You hear about Sona?

163
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,190
怎么了
What about it?

164
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,530
三天前被囚犯夷为平地了
Burned down three days back by the inmates.

165
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,530
囚犯暴乱了  没有贝里克  蒂博格和苏克雷的迹象
They rioted. no sign of Bellick, T-Bag, or Sucre.

166
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,260
苏克雷
Sucre?

167
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,930
他被抓了  我不知道原因
He got popped, I don't know how.

168
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,360
报纸上登出了囚犯名单...
I mean, the papers listed the names of the inmates...

169
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,760
监狱烧毁之前他在里面
And he was in there when it went down.

170
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,930
我找到惠斯勒和格雷琴了
I found Whistler and Gretchen...

171
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,860
格雷琴说...
Gretchen said...

172
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,030
她说莎拉还活着
She said Sara is still alive.

173
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,790
你究竟看到了什么  林肯
What did you see, Linc?

174
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,590
你是什么意思  迈克尔
What do you mean what did I see, Michael?

175
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,860
我要你告诉我  你到底看到了什么
I need you to tell me exactly what you saw.

176
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,190
迈克尔  莎拉已经死了
Michael, Sara's gone.

177
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,160
你说是在一个车库里  对吗  所以那一定很暗
You said it was in a garage, right? So it was dark.

178
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,290
对  是很暗
Yeah, it was dark.

179
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,530
但是如果你是在问  我是否拿起头...
But if you're asking me if I picked up the head...

180
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,090
检查是不是莎拉  不  迈克尔  我...
To check to see if it was Sara, no, Michael, I-I...

181
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,490
LJ说他...
LJ said he...

182
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,260
他只是听到他们杀了莎拉  对吗
He only heard them kill Sara, right?

183
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,430
你快回来吧  拜托
You just got to come back, please.

184
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,090
回来吧  我们一起...
Come back. Let's just...

185
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,660
一起开始新生活
Let's just start a new life.

186
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,090
替我向索菲亚问好
Tell Sofia I said hi.

187
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,890
告诉LJ...
And tell LJ...

188
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,890
告诉他  他叔叔很爱他
Tell him his uncle loves him.

189
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,060
迈克尔  别这样  求你了
Michael, don't do this, please.

190
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,830
亚利桑那沙漠  距离墨西哥边境5公里
Arizona Desert, 5 miles from the mexican border.

191
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,430
出来  出来
Out, out!

192
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,860
你该换一个好点的通风设备  朋友
You need some better ventilation back there, amigo.

193
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,130
想要翻译一下吗
Want to translate that?

194
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,090
不用了
Don't worry about it.

195
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,260
谢谢
Gracias.

196
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,830
你妈妈在哪儿
Where's your mom?

197
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,760
她会来的
She'll be here.

198
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,960
她回来的是什么意思
What do you mean she'll be here?

199
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,060
我们没时间了
We're running out of time.

200
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,660
-我得赶过去  -别担心
-I got to be up there. -Don't worry.

201
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,030
我妈妈不会让我失望的
My mom wouldn't let me down.

202
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,930
至少  目前还没有
At least, she hasn't yet.

203
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,230
布莱利  这里
Bradley, over here!

204
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,860
妈妈  妈妈
Mom! Mom!

205
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,190
我告诉过你的  别担心  你会准时到的
I told you! Don't worry, you'll make it there!

206
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,190
网址是什么
What is it called?

207
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,230
EuropeanGoldfinch.net
EuropeanGoldfinch.net

208
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,730
我们可以用它联系
It's what we can all use to communicate.

209
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,260
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德  我有莎拉的消息
MS: I have info on Sara.

210
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,530
迈克尔
Michael

211
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,260
别紧张  我是一个人
Don't worry, I'm alone.

212
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,560
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

213
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
你最好的朋友在哪
So where's your new best friend?

214
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
我不知道
I don't know about that.

215
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,500
但惠斯勒并不是你想的那样
But Whistler's not who you think he is.

216
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,200
我们在联手对付公司
We're working together against the Company.

217
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,000
-是吗  -是的
-Yeah?  -Yeah.

218
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,500
那格雷琴呢
And what about Gretchen?

219
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,500
她也是同你一起的
She working with you?

220
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,530
他需要她来强化他的计划
He needed her to further his plan.

221
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,800
听着  如果他是公司的人  上次见面的时候...
Look, if the guy was Company, he'd have shot you dead...

222
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,430
他就该照她说的杀了你
Back at that conference like she wanted him to.

223
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,200
你到底有没有莎拉的消息
Do you have any information about Sara or not?

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,900
我们找个僻静一点的地方
Let's go somewhere a little more private.

225
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,260
我要你现在就告诉我
I want you to tell me right now.

226
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,500
我要你告诉我  就现在  就在这里
I want you to tell me right now, right here!

227
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,940
或者我们可以给格雷琴挂电话
Or we can get Gretchen on the phone.

228
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,400
格雷琴死了
Gretchen's dead.

229
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
她一直没出现
She never showed up.

230
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,300
来和我谈谈  拜托
Come and talk to me, please.

231
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,700
惠斯勒和我去会面为的是拿一张数据卡
Whistler and I were at that conference to get a data card.

232
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,400
那就像是公司的黑名册
It's like the Company's black book.

233
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,700
记录着他们所有的特工和行动
And it lists all their agents, all their operations.

234
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,530
他们称之为...
They refer to it as...

235
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,200
锡拉
"Scylla."

236
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
惠斯勒拿到手了
Whistler's got it.

237
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,160
阿历克斯  跟我谈谈莎拉的事
Alex, talk to me about Sara.

238
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,260
我只关心这点
That's all I care about.

239
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,530
我理解
I understand that.

240
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,530
我也只想回家跟妻儿团聚
I want nothing more than to get home to my wife and my son.

241
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,600
但只要公司在追杀我们...
But that's not gonna happen for either of us...

242
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,030
对我们来说  这都是可望不可求
With the Company out there trying to kill us.

243
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,960
你根本就没有莎拉的消息  对吧
You don't know anything about Sara, do you?

244
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,930
惠斯勒有  他告诉他知道
Whistler does, he tells me he does.

245
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,560
他想告诉你
And he wants to tell you.

246
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,960
但他要东西来交换
But he wants something in return.

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,100
什么  他想要什么
What? What does he want from me?

248
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,360
同你见面
To talk to you.

249
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,000
对于那晚的事  我很抱歉
I'm sorry about all that the other night.

250
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,100
当时如果有时间的话  我会解释的更清楚
If I had more time, I would've explained myself better.

251
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,160
当然
Sure.

252
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
我们来这做什么
What are we doing here?

253
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,260
-阿历克斯告诉你锡拉的事了  -是的
-Alex told you about Scylla? -Yes.

254
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,030
在我这里
I have it.

255
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,560
还差一步就可以读取里面的数据了
There's one last step involved in order to read the data.

256
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,730
要完成这一步  需要闯入一个戒备森严的地方
And that step involves breaking into a secured structure.

257
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,830
所以你需要我帮忙
So now you need my help.

258
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,030
对
Yeah.

259
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,800
我的书  我在索纳监狱丢的那本鸟类书...
My book, the bird book, the one I lost in Sona...

260
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,850
里面有能帮我们更容易的闯入的信息
Contained information that would've helped facilitate the break-in.

261
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,430
但即便没有  我们也能做到
but it can still be accomplished,

262
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,850
在你的帮助之下
With your help.

263
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,000
莎拉在哪
Where's Sara?

264
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,900
我唯一能确定的是...
The only thing I know for sure...

265
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,900
一周前  有消息吐露
A week ago, some information came through the wire.

266
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,330
莎拉在圣达菲买了一张巴士票
Sara may have bought a bus ticket in Santa Fe.

267
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,560
开往哪的
Headed where?

268
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,700
芝加哥
Chicago.

269
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,100
迈克尔  如果莎拉在芝加哥  她并不安全
Michael, if Sara's out there, she's not safe.

270
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,200
我们大家都不安全
None of us are.

271
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,000
公司知道原始数据卡在我们手里
The Company knows we still have the original card.

272
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,900
这就是格雷琴死了的原因
And that's why Gretchen was the first to go.

273
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,200
我想我们没什么好谈的了
I think we're done here.

274
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,100
迈克尔  我们只有这一次机会
Michael, We have a chance for once

275
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,900
将锡拉交给那些想搞垮公司的人
To get Scylla to people that want to take the Company down.

276
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,530
我不想再逃了  我们都不必再逃了
I don't want to run anymore. We won't have to run anymore.

277
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,700
之前的一个月  我一直沉浸在失去莎拉的痛苦和...
I spent the last month thinking Sara was dead...

278
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,230
害死莎拉的自责之中
and that it was my fault.

279
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,460
如果她在芝加哥  我要去找她
If she's out there, I'm gonna find her.

280
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,000
我只关心这个
That's all I care about.

281
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,900
只要一周就能搞定
This can be done within a week.

282
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,400
不到一周
Less.

283
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,000
至少让我给你们...
At least let me show you...

284
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,220
巴拿马城  巴拿马
Panama City, Panama

285
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,520
我会想念这对美腿的  美女
Oh, I'm gonna miss these gams, girl.

286
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,150
别走
Don't go.

287
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,410
这里可不是来自阿拉巴马的白人的家
This ain't no home for a white boy from Alabama.

288
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,150
他们到了  先生  行李都准备好了
They're here, seur, the bags are packed.

289
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,810
你遵守了对我的诺言
You kept your word to me.

290
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,710
你是第一个做到这点的人  谢谢
You're the first that's ever done that. Gracias.

291
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,610
你为何一定要找这个人
Why must you go after this man?

292
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,450
你可以选择不去的
You could choose not to.

293
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,700
在我的家乡  有个词叫做宿敌
Where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.

294
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,070
明白吗
Comprende?

295
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
是的
Yes.

296
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,770
结果是迈克尔・斯科菲尔德...
Michael Scofield left me for dead...

297
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,730
很多次的都对我见死不救
One too many times, as it turns out.

298
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,570
"小天使"用西班牙语怎么说
What is Spanish for "little angel"?

299
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,300
Angelita
Angelita.

300
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,750
再见  小天使
Adios, angelita.

301
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,970
确定合法吗
Is this legit?

302
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
当然  先生
Oh, Sí seur

我在找莎拉  然而现在...

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,820
他曾是一位为公司工作了...
He was an independent contractor.

413
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,880
差不多10年的独立签约人
Who worked for the Company for about ten years.

414
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,180
公司派他追寻遗失的锡拉的下落
He was assigned to retrieve Scylla once it went missing.

415
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
你知道锡拉是什么吗

416
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,120
是公司的黑名册
It's the Company's little black book.

417
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,240
他本该拷贝一份交给我
So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me.

418
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,440
你想要我做什么

你觉得如果让你摆脱干系...
So how would you like to walk away from it all...

422
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,520
全身而退如何

00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,520
-用什么交换  -锡拉

对不起  她的事不归我管  我只管锡拉
I'm sorry, she's not my department, Scylla is.

428
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,720
那你自己去找吧
Then go find it yourself.

429
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,720
在我看来...
It seems to me...

430
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,820
美国政府应该比要被判以重罪的人...
The U.S. government should have a little more reach...

431
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,920
更有手段
Than someone who's looking at major time.

432
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,950
如果要找莎拉的话  迈克尔

不同部门领导的签名才行

438
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,780
听起来很复杂
It sounds complicated.

439
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,420
交易告吹
I'll take a pass.

440
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,080
我提供给你的是一个免除15年刑期的机会...
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail...

441
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,880
更不用说你哥哥所面临的了
Not to mention the time that your brother's facing.

442
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,480

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,620
很显然
Apparently.

446
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,080
但我刚刚同...
But I just made a deal...

447
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,480
巴拿马当局达成协议...
With the Panamanian authorities...

448
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,580
让他返回美国服刑
For him to serve out his time in the U.S.

449
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,580
他随时可能到达
He should be touching ground any time now.

450
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,450
你能认出这笔迹吗
You recognize this handwriting?

451
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,320
是你父亲的
This is your father's.

452
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,880
在他生命的最后两年里...
He spent the last two years...

453
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,480
一直在追查这件事
of his life going after this very thing.

454
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,180
你相信命运吗  迈克尔
Do you believe in fate, Michael?

455
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,850
我要跟我哥哥谈一谈
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.

456
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,420
不
Oh, no.

457
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,750
不
Oh, no.

458
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,620
怎么回事...
What's going...?

459
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,820
站住  站住  你不能进去
Stop! Stop! You don't want to go in there.

460
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,220
你不能进去
You don't want to go in there.

461
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,220
我们很遗憾
We're sorry, sorry.

462
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,880
天啊  她...
God, she's...

463
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,780
莉拉・玛丽亚・苏克雷
Lilah Maria Sucre.

464
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,620
她用了我的姓
She gave her my name?

465
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,420
我是你爸爸哦
Soy tu papa.

466
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,380
你出卖我
You're setting me up?

467
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,950
苏克雷  你不能再拖累玛丽克鲁兹了
Sucre, you can't keep bringing Maricruz down.

468
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,020
你不能再这样对她了
You can't do this to her anymore.

469
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,020
-没事的  -等等  别...
-It's OK. -Wait. Don't...

470
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,720
苏克雷  不要
Sucre, don't...

471
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,120
快  快
Go! Go!

472
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,550
天啊
Oh, boy.

473
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,320
我们完蛋了
We're screwed.

474
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,350
你们知道为什么斯科菲尔德...
You know why Scofield...

475
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,250
在我身边的时候总是苦恼不堪吗
Gets all twisted up when he's around me?

476
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,420
我们很相似  可他却不想承认这一点
We're the same, and he just can't stand it.

477
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,560
这让他近乎疯狂
Drives his ass crazy.

478
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,160
我们有同样聪明的头脑
We got the same brilliant mind.

479
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,020
同样与生俱来的领导能力
the same natural-born leader tendency.

480
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,260
同样万里挑一的个人魅力  对吧
the same one-in-a-million-type charisma, yes?

481
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,190
他却总是看不起我
He just gonna look down his nose at me?

482
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,290
你要怎么找到他
How you gonna find him?

483
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
这个
This.

484
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,290
你们都喜欢鸟
You're both into birds?

485
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,720
不
No, no.

486
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,090
它要么带我找到他  要么就是他找到我
It's either gonna take me to him, or he to me.

487
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,990
我就知道
I just know it.

488
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,160
如果我是你  我就忘掉斯科菲尔德
If I was you, I'd forget about this Scofield.

489
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,020
你有大把的钱  瞧  我是说...
You have plenty of money. See? I mean...

490
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,120
你包里装了多少钱
How much money you have in that bag?

491
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,520
为何不管好你们自己的事
Why don't you just mind your own beeswax, huh?

492
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,920
你就把这破车...
You just keep pointing...

493
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,320
一直往北开就行  好吗
this jalopy northbound, all right?

494
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,190
带我回美国
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.

495
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,720
当然
Of course.

496
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,520
准备好了
Ready.

497
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,360
政府只有几个人知道这次的行动
Only a few people in government will know of the operation.

498
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,820
必须得这样...
It has to stay that way...

499
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,590
否则大家都会处于危险之中  包括我
Or people's lives will be in danger, mine included.

500
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,020
把公司搞跨听起来不太像是两个人的工作  对吧
Taking down the company sounds a little bit more than a two-man job, no?

501
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,290
我会找人帮助你们
I'm going to get you help.

502
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,340
你不是说你不能相信任何人吗
I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody.

503
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
是  不过也许你们可以
Yeah, but maybe you can.

504
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,160
你们的两个朋友...
All right, two of your cohorts...

505
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,760
费尔南多・苏克雷和布拉德・贝里克被捕了
Fernando Sucre, and Brad Bellick were arrested.

506
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,220
他们都面临牢狱之灾
They're both facing time.

507
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,120
亚历山大・马宏在科罗拉多的监狱里
And Alexander Mahone is in a Colorado jail cell.

508
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,060
很好  就让他待在那好了
Good, let him sit there.

509
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,760
想要成功  我们需要马宏
You're going to need Mahone if you want to make this happen.

510
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,660
他曾经和惠斯勒合作过
He was working with Whistler.

511
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,560
我也会加入
And you'll have me.

512
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,120
如何  无论你们需要什么  我都会提供
Okay? Whatever you need, I'll provide.

513
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,220
惠斯勒还提过第二步计划
Whistler also said something about a second step,

514
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,120
关于闯入某个地方
Something about a break-in.

515
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,520
是的  卡里储存着所有的数据
Yeah, the card has all the data on it.

516
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,160
但是被加密了
But it's encrypted.

517
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,490
一旦你开始行动
Once you get your hands on it.

518
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,820
你就必须找到一个进入...
You're going to need to find a way to break...

519
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,320
公司总部的办法
Into the Company's headquarters.

520
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,990
这是解密那张卡的唯一办法
It's the only way to unlock what's on the card.

521
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,990
总部在哪
Where's the building?

522
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,590
-洛杉矶  -洛杉矶的哪里
-L.A. -Where in L.A.?

523
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,920
我不清楚
I don't know.

524
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,260
所以  我们要找到不知在何处的数据卡
So, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere.

525
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,660
然后闯入一个...
And we've got to break into a building...

526
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,690
确切地址不明的总部大楼
The location of which has yet to be determined.

527
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,260
很简单
Simple enough.

528
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,590
你曾经两次成功越狱
You've broken out of two penitentiaries.

529
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,390
我想闯入一座总部大楼...
I'm thinking, uh, breaking into a building...

530
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,760
对你来说应该不是太难吧
Isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.

531
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,160
你怎么知道我们父亲的
How do you know our dad?

532
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,320
他通过线人了解到我可以信任
He heard from contacts that I could be trusted.

533
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,890
你爸爸是个好人
Your father was a good man.

534
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,460
为什么是现在
Why now?

535
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,590
听着  我已经追查公司5年了
Look, I've been going after the Company for five years.

536
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,320
好吗  昨天惠斯勒被杀后...
Okay? When Whistler was killed yesterday...

537
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,860
整个调查行动都应该停止了
The plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation.

538
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,960
但是...
But, uh...

539
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,490
我说服我的上司再试最后一次
I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance.

540
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,760
这就像是你的保住饭碗行动
So this is like job security for you?

541
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,760
什么
What's that?

542
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,820
所以当我们冲锋陷阵的时候...
Well, when we go out there and risk our necks...

543
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,320
你就能确保你的退休金了
You can collect your pension.

544
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,790
不  不  林肯
No, no, no, Lincoln.

545
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,560
有些人关心的是自己的工作
Okay, some people still care about their job.

546
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,520
有些人是在为这个国家而奋斗
Some people still fight for this country.

547
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,420
也许你太过于...
Maybe you've been a little too distracted...

548
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,720
固执己见  一意孤行了
Boosting car stereos and breaking heads to remember that.

549
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,190
如果我们参加的话...
If we do this deal...

550
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,620
事成之后
After it's done.

551
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,320
你就可以去找莎拉了  如果她还活着
You can look for Sara, if she's alive.

552
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,490
如果我们参加  在我有机会...
If we take this deal, we'll both be dead...

553
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,920
找她之前  我们就都会死的  林肯
Long before I get the chance, Linc.

554
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,390
你们一定有些有权有势的朋友
You guys must have some big-time friends.

555
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,720
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

556
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,120
有人刚刚交了一笔...
Somebody just posted...

557
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,060
数额可观的保释金替你们保释
A significant amount of bail for both of you.

558
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,160
谁
Who?

559
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,920
我不知道  他们在外面
I don't know, but they're outside.

560
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,020
你们可以走了
You're free to go.

561
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,690
拿着  带上你爸爸的文件  里面有我的电话
Here, take your dad's file. My number's inside.

562
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,120
-我们不参加  -拿着吧
-We ain't doing this. -Just take it anyway.

563
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,820
这文件对我来说已经没有用了
This file, it means nothing to me anymore.

564
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,620
布鲁斯・班尼特
Bruce Bennett.

565
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,760
我们走吧
Let's go for a drive.

566
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,540
我以为再也见不到你了
I thought I'd never see you again.

567
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,970
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

568
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,500
好啊
Okay.

569
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,440
你忘记这个了
You left this behind.

570
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,040
你把玫瑰找回来了
Is that what this is about?

571
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,270
是这个意思吗
You just getting me my rose back?

572
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,900
是的  我想我完成任务了
Yeah. I guess I'm done now.

573
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,100
我可以退休了
I can retire.

574
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,170
你会入狱多久
How much time are you looking at?

575
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,640
他们说要15年
They're saying 15 years.

576
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,700
我得确定一下
I have to find out for sure.

577
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,640
我听林肯说有个什么交易
I heard Lincoln say something about a deal.

578
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,140
不必坐牢
No jail time.

579
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,840
条件是弄跨公司
In exchange for taking down the Company.

580
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,970
如何弄垮
How?

581
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,070
这就是问题所在
Exactly.

582
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,500
我爱你
I love you.

583
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,000
我现在只知道这一点
That's all I know right now.

584
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,670
你难道不会向万能的主屈服吗
"Will you not yield to the immortal gods?"

585
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,070
噩梦不会觉醒
"That nightmare cannot die."

586
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,740
永不休止的罪恶
"Eternal evil itself."

587
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,440
没人能打败她  没有
"There is no fighting her, no."

588
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,170
没有力量能打败她
"No power that can fight her."

589
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,240
听我说  现在由你们自己做主了
Now, listen to me, it's up to you now.

590
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,400
逃跑是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

591
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,100
抱歉  我没想吓你
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

592
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,270
对不起
I'm sorry.

593
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,100
想跟我聊聊吗
Do you want to talk about it?

594
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,870
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

595
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,400
不是
It's not.

596
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,540
告诉我是怎么回事
Tell me what happened.

597
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,270
是公司
It's just the Company.

598
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,700
这就是他们的所作所为
It's just what they do.

599
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,370
不仅是我
It wasn't just me.

600
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,700
上帝  你和LJ...
God, it was you and LJ and-and

601
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,540
还有林肯
Lincoln.

602
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,270
他们不会罢手的
And they won't stop.

603
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,640
我不知道该怎么办
and I don't know how to deal with that.

604
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,070
过来
Hey, come here.

605
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,900
过来  到我这儿来
Come here. Come here.

606
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,600
我们走!
Let's go!

607
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,170
你没事吧
Are you okay?

608
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,340
难以置信他们这么快就找到我们了
I can't believe they found us so fast.

609
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,170
我是不是该打电话给布鲁斯
Should I call, should I call Bruce

610
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,740
叫他找个安全的地方
And-and get some place safe?

611
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,640
没有地方是安全的
No place is safe.

612
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,740
除非我们弄垮公司  否则他们不会罢休的  林肯
They're not gonna stop unless we stop them. Linc?

613
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,370
你和我想的一样吧  让我们结束这一切
You are thinking what I'm thinking? Let's end this.

614
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,470
我不会再次丢下你不管的
But I'm not gonna leave you behind again.

615
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,170
喂
Yeah?

616
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,940
我们加入了
We're in.

617
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,300
你好  兄弟
Hey, papi.

618
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,170
林肯
Linc.

619
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,270
我不知道如何表达你让我加入的感激之情
I can't tell you how grateful I am for you including me.

620
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,900
是苏克雷给你担保的  贝里克
Well, Sucre vouched for you, Bellick.

621
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,670
他说在巴拿马 你是因为他才被抓的
He said you came through...For him down in Panama.

622
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,070
阿历克斯
Alex?

623
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,170
迈克尔
Michael.

624
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,940
你准备好了吗
You ready for this?

625
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,970
是的  我准备好了
Yeah. I am.

626
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,040
我听说惠斯勒的那本鸟类书籍里...
So I hear Whistler's bird book...

627
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,100
有我们要偷的东西的详细资料
Has details about what we need to steal.

628
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,670
是的
Yeah.

629
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,200
你知道在谁手里  对吧
You know who's got it, right?

630
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,840
求你了
Please.

631
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,340
我们会死在这里的
We'll die out here.

632
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,370
谢谢你的钞票  外国佬
Thanks for the cash, gringo.

633
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,600
全程头等服务
First class all the way.

634
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,080
你知道帝博格在哪儿吗
Do we have any idea where T-Bag is?

635
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,850
谁知道那狡猾的家伙在哪
That snake could be anywhere.

636
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,070
在洛杉矶  我们可以像犯人一样思考
When we're in L.A., we can think like convicts.

637
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,270
但却不能那样行事
We just can't act like them.

638
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,270
如果那么做  我们就死定了
If we do, we're done.

639
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,650
显而易见...
It goes without saying...

640
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,950
现在是退出的最后机会
This is your last chance to back out.

641
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,280
因为我无法保证的事情中...
'cause first on the list of things...

642
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,680
最重要的一点就是你们的命
I cannot guarantee you is your safety.

643
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,780
我们偏离原先的初衷...
We're all a long way...

644
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,050
太远了
From where this started.

645
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,250
但我向你保证的是...
But what I can guarantee you...

646
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,180
如果我们成功的话
Is that if we do this thing right.

647
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,980
就距离我们的目标更近了
We'll be close to where it ends.

648
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,320
就是自由
Freedom.

649
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,480
最终的自由
Finally.

650
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:22,000
你们俩  我们走吧
You two, let's go.

651
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,200
麦克
Hey, Mike?

652
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,600
莎拉怎么样了
What about Sara?

653
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,200
莎拉加入了
Sara's in.

654
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,040
好的  我们明天出发
All right, we're heading out tomorrow.

655
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,500
离开之前我要最后确认一些事
I have to finalize a few things before we go.

656
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,540
不玩阴谋  不耍花招
No games and no stunts.

657
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,870
否则的话  我保证...
Otherwise, I promise...

658
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,000
你会看到我完全不一样的另一面
You're gonna see a whole different side of me.

659
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,100
我们也是
Likewise.

660
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,640
假身份证
Fake IDs.

661
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,240
不错的开始
It's a good start.

662
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,340
但有些东西无法作假
But there are some things you can't fake.

663
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,900
有些东西...
And there are some things...

664
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,100
无法隐藏
You can't hide.

665
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,040
明白我的意思吗
Know what I mean?

666
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,970
你对痛觉的忍受度有多高
How high is your threshold for pain?

667
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,840
你确定不用镇痛剂吗
You sure you don't want a sedative?

668
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,570
现在是最痛的时候了
We're gonna go into the night.

669
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,600
感觉如何
How do you feel?

670
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,100
不知为何  变轻了
Lighter somehow.

671
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,700
我都不知道该如何搞垮公司
Look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down.

672
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,570
我甚至不知道他们的身份
I don't even know who they are.

673
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,770
我只知道一件事...
But I do know one thing...

674
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,870
公司将为他们对你的所作所为付出代价
The Company's gonna pay for what they did to you.

675
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,570
我们走吧
Let's go.

676
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,240
你确定你要加入
You sure you're up for this?

677
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,900
如果我们...
If we can...

678
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,940
能一起的话  是的
do it together, yeah.

679
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,670
-好  -当然
-OK. -Absolutely.

680
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,340
AC-130运输机  他们要干什么...
AC-130? What do they want...

681
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,500
难道让我们跳伞吗
Want us to parachute out of this thing?

682
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,100
那家伙找了空军协助
This guy called in a favor to the Air Force.

683
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,340
我们总不能坐民航飞机  对吧
It's not like we can be flying commercial, you know?

684
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,100
如果你们成功拿到锡拉
If you're successful with obtaining Scylla.

685
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,200
不仅可以免除牢狱之灾  而且你们会为...
You'll not only avoid jail time, but you can take great pride...

686
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,940
铲除对这个国家民主的最大威胁...
In knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat...

687
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,800
而感到自豪
To its own democracy.

688
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,700
如果在执行任务过程中身亡...
If you're killed while doing so...

689
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,540
将会被赋予体面的葬礼
A proper funeral will be provided.

690
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,700
但如果你们试图逃跑...
But if you try to escape...

691
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,340
不但没有葬礼
You will have no funeral.

692
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,700
什么都不会得到
You will have nothing,

693
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,670
你们会被追捕...
And you will be apprehended and buried where...

694
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,170
并被就地处决
We find you.

695
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,340
我衷心希望我们能互相理解
I sincerely hope we understand each other.

696
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,470
你最好信守诺言
You better hold up your end of the deal.

697
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,740
我们走
let's go!

698
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,270
洛杉矶  加利福尼亚
Los Angeles, California.

699
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,910
他们答应您的要求了  将军
They are in projection you asked for, general.

700
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,420
线路安全  说吧
You clear, go ahead.

701
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,150
事情有些复杂了
There has been a complication.

702
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,450
布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德已经被转移到...
Burrows and scofield had been transferred to...

703
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,400
我看过报纸了
I read the newspapers,

704
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,900
你不必告诉我头版头条的新闻
You don't have to tell me what's in the headlines.

705
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,540
他们到底被关在哪座监狱还不得而知
The exact penitary where they are been held is under disclosed.

706
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,900
不过肯定是联邦级的  重型监狱
But you can guarantee it'll be the federal, supremax.

707
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,960
不必再汇报了
No more updates.

708
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,410
干掉他们后再给我电话
Call me when they are dead.

709
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,410
欢迎来到洛杉矶
Welcome to Los angles.

710
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,140
问题是  越狱过不止一次的人...
As it turns out, Men who have escaped not one...

711
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,130
被认为是有一定的潜逃隐患的
But two penitaries are considered as a bit of flight risks.

712
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,670
所以我们需要时刻了解...
So we need to know where you are...

713
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,230
你们的位置和行动
And what you're doing at all times.

714
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,770
这些是脚踝全球定位跟踪器
These are GPS ankle monitors.

715
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,000
现在过来拿一个带上
Now step up, take one and put it on.

716
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,930
我不带
I ain't wearing that.

717
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,930
让我们说清楚
Let's make this clear.

718
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,270
我是你们的盟友
I'm your ally.

719
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,430
但更重要的是  我是你们的老板
But more importantly, I'm your boss.

720
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:27,770
也就是说  如果这次行动失败
Which means if this fails.

721
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,100
和你们比起来 我会面临更大的麻烦
It's my ass on the line as much If not more than yours,

722
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:30,870
所以从现在开始
 so from this point on.

723
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,500
我让你们做什么  你们就做什么
If I ask you to do something, you do it.

724
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,030
我让你们说什么
If I ask you to say something.

725
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:35,970
你们就说什么
You say it.

726
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,870
我让你们带上跟踪器
And if I ask you to put on a monitor.

727
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,670
你们就带上跟踪器
You put on a monitor.

728
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,030
目前为止所有人都认为...
As far as the general public is concerned...

729
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,130
你们被关押在美国境内某个重型监狱里
You're being contained in a supermax facility somewhere In the United States

730
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,030
所以要避免无谓的解释
So to avoid any messy explanations.

731
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,330
避免被公司发现
And stay off the Company's radar.

732
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:13,400
你们要低调行事并且保持警惕
You need to keep your heads down and your ears open.

733
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,830
我们提供了手机  衣物和洗漱用品
We've provided cell phones, clothing, and toiletries.

734
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,900
所有的基本必需品都已准备好了
All the basic necessities to get you up and running.

735
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,030
你让这些家伙进来之前都搜过身了吧
You patted these guys down before you let them in, right?

736
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,830
我可不想被暗算
Cause I can't be getting shanked or shivved.

737
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,830
他是谁
Who's this?

738
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,030
他是罗兰・格伦
This is Roland Glenn.

739
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,100
他会协助你们
He'll be assisting you.

740
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,300
我们的队伍已经满员了
We've already got our team.

741
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,770
不是  斯科菲尔德  这是我的队伍
No, Scofield, see, this is my team.

742
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,730
罗兰和你们一样...
And Roland's working off...

743
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,070
也要干活来免除牢狱之灾
A sentence just like the rest of you.

744
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,970
事实上  就对锡拉保安的严密程度而言...
In fact, with the amount of security that's gonna be around Scylla...

745
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,170
罗兰的专长是必要的
Roland's expertise will be a necessity.

746
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,230
所以  如果没有其它问题
So, if no more questions.

747
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,700
我们开始寻找锡拉的工作吧
Let's get to work on finding Scylla.

748
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,830
那个第二步怎么办
What about that second step?

749
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,200
闯入的问题呢
What about the break-in?

750
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,670
我来负责第二步  好吗
You let me worry about step two, okay?

751
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,130
你把精力放在寻找锡拉就好
You just worry about finding Scylla.

752
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,800
关于从哪入手  我有个想法
I've got an idea where to start.

753
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,230
非常棒  亚历山大
That's excellent, Alexander.

754
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,700
你瞧  还有人在思考
See, there's a man who's thinking.

755
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,230
好了  大家开始工作吧
All right, let's let these men get to work.

756
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:00,700
祝我们大家都好运
Good luck, to all of us.

757
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,330
既然我是第一个到的...
Since I was here first I think I'll...

758
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:07,470
如果大家没意见  那个最舒服的房间就归我了
Just go ahead and grab that S.S. bedroom, if that's cool.

759
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,800
-莎拉  -怎么
-Sara. -Yeah?

760
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:12,000
那个位置归你
You take the bunk.

761
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,530
当这一切结束以后
You know, when this is, when this is all done.

762
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,830
你和我  我们要做个了断
You and me, we're gonna settle up.

763
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,630
很明显
All right, obviously.

764
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,070
这里的恩怨很多
There's a lot of history in this room.

765
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,430
这显而易见
That's a given.

766
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,530
但如果我们要完成任务
But it we're gonna pull this off.

767
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,470
需要所有人的努力
It's gonna take all of us.

768
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,700
我们要团结一致
We got to work together.

769
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,030
如果谁有问题  现在就说出来
So if anyone has a problem, get it out now.

770
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,000
谁想要和别人解决恩怨...
You want to clear the air with someone...

771
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,870
就是现在了
Now's the time.

772
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,400
好的
All right.

773
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:52,900
我们开始干活吧
Let's get to work.

774
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,970
惠斯勒的任务是把数据卡...
Whistler's assignment was to drop off this data card...

775
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,400
锡拉交给一名公司高管
This 'Scylla' to a Company Executive.

776
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,570
一个被他称为"持卡者"的人
Someone he referred to as "The Cardholder."

777
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,830
他的任务是保护数据卡
And his job was to-to protect it.

778
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,230
保证它的安全
To keep it safe.

779
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,630
目前  我还不知道他是谁
Now, I didn't see who he was.

780
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,000
不过我见过他的司机
But I got a look at his driver.

781
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,100
他的司机
His driver?

782
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,730
你想描绘这家伙的脸...
You want to sketch this guy's face...

783
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,300
再和一千万洛杉矶人比对吗
And match it up to 10 million people in Los Angeles?

784
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,900
这太有才了
Well, that's just great.

785
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,470
我不仅看到了他的脸
I saw more than just the guy's face.

786
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,730
当其他的司机都在胡扯闲聊的时候
All the drivers were hanging around, talking shop.

787
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,630
但这个家伙  独自站在旁边
But this guy, he was standing by himself.

788
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,070
两腿微分  双手背后
Legs apart, hands behind his back.

789
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,930
静止不动  他是位退伍军人
At rest, he's former military.

790
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,200
他车的底盘比其他的都低
His car rides a little lower than the rest of 'em.

791
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,970
也许是由于注重安全性的...
Probably signifies private security...

792
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
防弹玻璃增加车身重量的原因
Weighed down by bulletproof siding.

793
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,970
他的衣服  仅凭警察的工资或...
His suit, you don't buy a suit like that...

794
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,870
周末兼职司机的外块  是买不起的
On a cop's salary or pulling weekend gigs as a driver.

795
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,470
说明他是全职
That means he's full-time.

796
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,530
高薪
He's highly paid.

797
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,070
如果请我们的朋友  赛尔夫先生查一下...
You ask our friend Mr. Self to run tax records...

798
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,700
生活在洛杉矶45至55岁之间的...
On the 45- to 55-year-old white males...

799
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,270
领取军方退休金  并且从私人保安公司赚取...
In Los Angeles drawing a military pension...

800
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,300
6位数以上年薪的白人男性税务记录的话...
And taking six figures from a private security company...

801
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:59,030
就能把范围从1000万人缩小到大概50人
And you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50.

802
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,100
然后我就能从中找出那个家伙了
And then I can pick the guy out from there.

803
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,100
找到司机  就能找到持卡者
Find the driver, you find the Cardholder.

804
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,100
墨西哥沙漠  距美国边境60英里
Mexican Desert, 60 miles south of US border.

805
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,630
我们已经好几天不吃不喝了
We haven't ate or drank anything for days.

806
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,770
我不想死在这里
Oh, I don't want to die out here.

807
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,770
我们不会死的  桑乔
We ain't gonna die, Sancho.

808
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,200
-我们不会死的  -好的
-Hey, hey, we ain't gonna die. -OK

809
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,270
我们只需要找到...
We just gotta find...

810
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,270
那个叫什么  仙人掌指南针就好
What's called, a compass cactus.

811
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,100
因为仙人掌总是向南倾斜的
Due to the fact it always leans toward the south.

812
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,000
里面是鲜美的果肉  我们可以填饱肚子
Inside there's delicious fruit which'll fill our bellies.

813
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,770
而且  我们会知道哪边是南
Plus, we find out which way is south.

814
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,570
我们得找到哪边是北才行
We're gonna find out which way is north.

815
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,530
明白吗
Comprender?

816
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,270
这样吧
Tell you what.

817
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,930
我们在这休息一会如何
Why don't we rest here for a while, huh?

818
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,400
等晚上凉快一点再走
Travel at night when it's cooler.

819
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,670
对  这主意不错
Si, that sounds good.

820
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,570
我们到那之后怎么办
What are we gonna do when we get there?

821
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,400
到圣地亚哥
To San Diego.

822
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,000
你是说等迈克尔为他...
You mean after Michael pays...

823
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,200
对我所做的卑鄙无耻的事付出代价之后吗
For the vile he's transgressed upon me?

824
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,870
我还在考虑这是什么意思
I'm still trying to figure that out.

825
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,400
和国土安全局合作真不错
Nice to work with Homeland.

826
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,730
联邦调查局想得到这些信息得大费周折
The FBI would take days to gather this intel.

827
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:31,970
联邦调查局该雇用我
Well, the FBI should'a hired me

828
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,670
无论什么资料  我都能在25分钟内搞到手
Cause I could've gotten whatever info you wanted in 25 minutes tops.

829
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,170
你是黑客吗
Are you some kind of hacker?

830
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,700
我以设计硅光刻为生
I design silicon lithography for personal gain.

831
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,070
他是个身份窃贼
He's an identity thief.

832
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,400
他是个蠢货
He's a douche.

833
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,870
你坐一边去
Hey, why don't you sit in the corner.

834
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,270
需要你的时候我们会叫你
And we'll get you when we need you.

835
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,330
就是他
This is him.

836
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,100
他就是那个司机
That's the driver.

837
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,230
现在怎么办
Now what?

838
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,170
他能带我们找到持卡者
Well, he takes us to the Cardholder.

839
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,970
持卡者能带我们找到锡拉
And the Cardholder takes us to Scylla.

840
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,570
你可以把我扔在监狱里不管的
You could have left me there, in jail.

841
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,230
是可以还是应该
Could have or should have?

842
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,800
也许都是
Maybe both.

843
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,330
你是在感谢我吗  阿历克斯
Are you thanking me, Alex?

844
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,900
-我不知道  -别在意了
-I don't know. -Don't bother.

845
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,900
我们是需要你来
You're here because we needed you.

846
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,670
-不是想要你来  -就是他
-Not because we wanted you. -That's him.

847
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,100
就是家伙
That's the guy.

848
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,370
那是什么  看起来像是私人保镖
What's that, looks like private security?

849
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,300
这里就像是城堡一样
It's like a fortress.

850
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,370
慢点  慢点
Slow down, slow down.

851
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,830
我们在找的东西
This thing we gotta get.

852
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,570
在里面吗
It's in there?

853
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,470
运动传感器  警报系统
Motion sensors, alarm systems.

854
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,330
武装保安
Armed guards.

855
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,430
神不知鬼不觉的进去再出来
In and out of that place without anybody knowing.

856
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,300
你最好做个完美的计划  迈克尔
You better have one hell of a plan, Michael.

857
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:02,270
所以基本上根本无法潜入那个地方
So, basically there's no freaking way to break in to the place.

858
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,100
不可能那么快  不可能不被发现
Not quickly, not without being seen.

859
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,400
周边建筑呢  有什么地方我们可以...
What about the neighbors, somewhere we can be staged from...

860
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,070
挖地道钻过去
You know, go under and up?

861
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,100
最近的一处在这里  路对面
Closest neighbor is here, across the street.

862
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,630
就算这样也要数周时间
And even that would take weeks.

863
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,570
政府放出我们被关押在重型监狱的假消息...
The government's story about us being held in a supermax...

864
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:19,430
不会隐瞒太久
Will only last so long.

865
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,770
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

866
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,970
我是说  如果有人发现事实怎么办
I mean, then what if somebody finds out we're not.

867
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,470
或许我们不需要闯入那所房子
What if we don't have to be in the house?

868
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,770
如果那个数据卡  锡拉如此重要
If the card, this Scylla is so important.

869
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,370
也许那家伙是随身携带的
Maybe the guy is carrying it on him.

870
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,830
根据政府公共记录
Well, according to public records.

871
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,130
该物业的主人名为斯图亚特・塔克豪恩
The owner of the estate's name is Stuart Tuxhorn.

872
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,870
他是一家名为斯皮克托利姆公司的总裁
And he's a CEO of a company called Spectroleum.

873
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,400
这样的大人物一定是24小时有保镖贴身保护的
Heavy hitter like that's gonna have security 24-7.

874
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,430
我们要在神不知鬼不觉的情况下...
And we gotta get this thing...

875
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,770
把数据卡偷走  对吧
Without anyone knowing it's gone, right?

876
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,970
就算他随身携带  我们如何行事
So even if he's got it on him, how do we get it off him?

877
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,400
我们不必偷走数据卡
You don't steal the card.

878
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,870
复制一份就行
You copy it.

879
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:53,070
现在你们对我的话感兴趣了  对吧
Oh, now you're interested in what I gotta say, right?

880
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,670
复制一份更难做到
Copying it will make it harder.

881
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,970
不止要偷
Not only do you have to steal it.

882
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,170
而且要还  天才
You have to return it, genius.

883
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,070
有我便不必了  哥们
Only if you don't got me, hombre.

884
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,300
那是什么
What's that?

885
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,630
我就是因为这个被抓的
This is the reason I got busted.

886
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,870
你偷了个手机吗
Oh, you stole the cell phone?

887
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,230
不  不
Oh, yeah, yeah, no.

888
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,870
偷手机就要被关重型监狱  你开玩笑吧
I'm looking at federal time cause I stole a cell phone, seriously?

889
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,570
我发明了这个
I invented this

890
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,130
所以我不必去偷
So that I don't have to steal.

891
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:20,370
它看起来像是个手机  但实际上它...
It looks like a cell phone but it's really like...

892
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,630
像是个数码黑洞
A digital black hole.

893
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,200
这是可以接受10英尺内所有电子数据的...
Wireless hard drive that swallows up any electronic data...

894
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,330
无线接收器
Within ten feet of it.

895
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,400
比如
Like what?

896
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,670
可以接收在星巴克...
Like the account info...

897
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,230
无线上网的人的帐户信息
Of anyone at Starbucks with a latte and a laptop.

898
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,270
可以接收加油站使用信用卡的顾客的密码
Like the PIN number of any credit card used at a gas pump.

899
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,330
用它我可以轻轻松松的用一只手...
I can walk out of here and get the identities...

900
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:37,270
在十分钟内得到十个人的...
And financial statements of ten people in ten minutes...

901
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,770
身份及账户信息
On a slow day, with one hand on my junk.

902
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,070
锡拉里面的信息呢
And the information embedded in Scylla?

903
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,370
只要能接近...
If we can get close enough...

904
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,370
就是我们的了
It's ours.

905
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,130
这个数目  你能接受吗
Is this number acceptable to you?

906
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,130
1万人
10,000 people?

907
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,830
-可以  -很好
-Yes. -Good.

908
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,270
现在你加入了
Now that you're on board.

909
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,030
我们今天就可以传达行动命令了
We can issue the op-order today.

910
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,440
他上路了
He's on his way.

911
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,610
好的  稍等
All right, hold on.

912
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,880
莎拉  是我
Sara, it's me.

913
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,580
大家都已就绪
Everybody's on.

914
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,480
在我运行装置的时候
Now, while I'm monitoring the device.

915
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,640
我无法知道...
I'm not gonna be able to see...

916
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:54,710
拷贝的具体内容
Exactly what data's being copied.

917
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,180
但就像从网上下载A片一样
But, like downloading quality porn from the Internet.

918
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:00,130
进度条会显示什么时候会传输完毕
Progress bar's gonna tell me when it's time to rock and roll.

919
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,880
他们需要待在范围内多久
How long do they need to stay in range?

920
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,680
像这样的加密数据需要至少2分钟
Encrypted data like this is gonna take at least two minutes.

921
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,340
他来了
Here he comes.

922
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,110
苏克雷  该你了
Sucre, you're on.

923
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,680
好运
Good luck.

924
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,780
先生  您可否不要靠近车
Sir, would you mind stepping away from the vehicle?

925
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,340
怎么样了  罗兰
Talk to me, Roland.

926
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,580
我什么都没收到  伙计
I got nothing, man.

927
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,310
上次我这么努力的还是在...
Last time I had this little action...

928
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,840
艰难的通过五年级考试的时候
I was dry humping my way through fifth grade.

929
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,180
冷静点
Calm down.

930
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,810
先生
Sir.

931
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,340
先生
Sir.

932
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,840
离车远点
Step away from the vehicle!

933
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,640
好的  哥们  放松点  我们不必如此激动
Okay, bro, just relax, we don't have to get all excited.

934
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,780
现在你会说英语了
You speak English now.

935
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:50,410
只会一点  但是...
Only a little, but...

936
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,540
现在怎么样了
How about now?

937
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,580
不行
Nada.

938
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,110
试着再靠近一点儿
Try to get closer to them.

939
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,740
再靠近  他就得进车里了
If he was any closer, he'd be in the car.

940
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,640
我知道你的小把戏了  混蛋
I get your little act, Pedro.

941
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,910
故意撞车
Hit the brakes.

942
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,440
让有钱人赔钱  你就不用修车了
let the rich guy pay for damage you don't intend to fix.

943
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,280
给他点钱我们好走
Just give the man some money so we can leave.

944
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,280
恭喜你
Congratulations.

945
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,040
他在那  我想塔克豪恩在车里
He was there, I think Tuxhorn was in the car.

946
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,140
-我们到底收到没有  -没有
-So did we get it or not? -Nope.

947
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,480
什么都没有
Nothing.

948
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,110
我能效劳吗
Can I help you?

949
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,680
你怎么找到我的
So how did you find me?

950
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,340
我一直在跟踪你
I never lost you.

951
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,940
新鼻子让我有点吃惊  但是...
The, uh, the new nose threw me a bit, but...

952
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,710
你想要什么  当
What do you want, Don?

953
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,110
我还有客人
I got customers.

954
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,380
从前  你和公司合作的时候...
Look, back in the days, when you worked with the Company.

955
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,410
为公司卖命
Well, for the Company.

956
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,910
我负责公司的经营预测
I did economic forecasts of their operations.

957
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,680
我是说  我不是那些人中的一员...
I mean, I wasn't one of the guys...

958
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,680
但你有人脉
But you had access.

959
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,310
得了吧  上次我帮你
Come on, the last time I helped you.

960
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,780
除了花10万美金做个手术以外...
The only thing I got out of it...

961
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,140
我什么都没有得到
Was plastic surgery and a $100,000 pay cut.

962
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:14,080
所以  要么你买一辆大马力的顶级豪华车
so either you buy one of these exceptional family cars

963
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:15,780
要么你就滚蛋
Or you leave me the hell alone.

964
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,480
我知道锡拉的事
I know about Scylla

965
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,140
而且我在找它
And I'm going after it.

966
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,440
我知道你很疯狂
You know, I knew you were crazy.

967
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,910
但不知道你也很蠢
I didn't know you were stupid, too.

968
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,580
假如说我能拿到数据卡
Well, let's just say I was able to get hands on it.

969
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,510
据我理解  锡拉只有在插在...
It's my understanding that Scylla could only be used...

970
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,410
藏在公司内部某处的...
If it's plugged into a decoder box...

971
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,040
解码器上才能被读取
That's hidden in one of the Company facilities.

972
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,080
我说的对吗
Am I right?

973
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,540
我希望我能帮忙
You know, I wish I could help.

974
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,940
但我爱莫能助
but I can't.

975
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,280
不  你会帮忙的  贾斯帕
No, you are helping, Jasper.

976
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,880
问题只是在我把你当着同事的面...
Just a matter of whether you do it before or after...

977
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,940
羞辱一番之前还是之后罢了
I shame you in front of your coworkers here.

978
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,240
告诉我公司把解码器藏在哪  贾斯帕
Tell me where the Company keeps the box, Jasper.

979
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,310
可能在任何地方  我不知道
Could be anywhere, I don't know.

980
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,840
总有人知道吧
Somebody does.

981
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,840
对吧
Right?

982
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,840
你认识的某个人
Somebody that you might have access to.

983
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,380
如果你一意孤行
You know, if you go down this road.

984
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,180
你的政府职位也保不了你
Your government job won't protect you.

985
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,940
那我最好别被抓住  对吧
Then I better not get caught, right?

986
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,640
如果我不快点找到些吃的
If I don't find something to eat soon.

987
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,780
我真不知道该怎么办
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

988
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,080
我们撑不过去的
We're not gonna make it.

989
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,180
我们得不停的说话  桑乔
We just got to keep talking, Sancho.

990
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,640
把注意力从饥饿的肚皮和...
Keep our brains focused on something other than...

991
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,710
干裂的嘴唇上转移开  好吗
Our empty bellies and our dry mouths, okay?

992
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,980
来吧
Come on.

993
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:20,880
从你最喜欢的颜色说起
Let's start with, uh, your-your favorite color.

994
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,880
你他妈的在干嘛
Hell you doing?!

995
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,240
我太饿了  泰迪
I'm hungry, Teddy.

996
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,580
与其我们两个都死在这
Why should the both of us die out here.

997
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,710
不如一个人牺牲自己  成全对方
When one of us could help the other one survive?

998
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,540
你不该这样做  拜托
You don't want to do this. Please.

999
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,740
我会给你个痛快的  我保证
I'll make it quick. I promise!

1000
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,780
桑乔
Sancho.

1001
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,610
桑乔
Sancho!

1002
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,910
你为什么非要做这样的...
Why'd you have to go and do something so...

1003
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
这么说塔克豪恩没把卡带在身上
So Tuxhorn doesn't keep the card on him.

1004
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,140
一定在里面  对吧
It must be in there, right?

1005
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,880
听着  想要潜进房子而不被发现...
Look, there's no way we're getting...

1006
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,440
是不可能的
In that house without being seen.

1007
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,880
我知道
I know.

1008
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:48,110
如果卡在房子里  我们如何拷贝
Well, if the card's in there, how we gonna copy it?

1009
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,080
不是我们
We're not.

1010
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:52,010
她替我们做
She's gonna do it for us.

1011
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,440
在看什么呢
What're you reading?

1012
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,380
没人能打败她
"There is no fighting her."

1013
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,110
没有力量能打败她
"No power can fight her.

1014
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,240
飞行是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

1015
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,040
这是荷马的...
That's homer...

1016
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,340
《奥德赛》中的片段
That's from The Odyssey.

1017
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,340
-这些是我父亲文件中的东西  -是的
-Is this from my father's folder? -Yeah.

1018
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,580
这也解释了为何锡拉听起来这么耳熟
And it explains why Scylla sounded so familiar.

1019
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,580
如果我没弄错的话  这是书中...
If I'm not mistaken, it's from that chapter in the book...

1020
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:27,610
奥德赛被告知...
Where Odysseus is told...

1021
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:32,280
他要勇敢的面对一个叫锡拉的妖怪
He has to confront a monster known as Scylla.

1022
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,480
他为什么要写这个
Wonder why he wrote this down.

1023
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,310
我说的不一定正确  但我相信...
I could be wrong, but I believe...

1024
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,880
奥德塞斯被告知...
Odysseus is told that in order to...

1025
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,040
要继续前行  打倒锡拉...
Continue on his path, to pass Scylla...

1026
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,040
必须牺牲他的六名手下
It'll require the sacrifice of six of his men.

1027
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,980
否则他只有放弃他的旅途
His only other alternative is to abandon his path.

1028
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,680
他选择了牺牲手下
And he chooses to make the sacrifice.

1029
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,210
真是个艰难的选择
Well, it's a hell of a choice.

1030
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,780
我不知道我能否做出选择
One I'm not sure I'm comfortable making.

1031
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:07,310
莎拉  关于明天女佣的那个计划
Sara, um, about tomorrow the plan, the housekeeper.

1032
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:11,410
如果你为难的话
If you're not up to it.

1033
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,480
不  不  我可以
No, no, I am.

1034
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,480
芝加哥  伊利诺斯州
Chicago, Illinois.

1035
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,980
告诉我
Tell me.

1036
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:30,940
克劳迪娅・毛里西奥是位好室友吗
Is Claudia Mauricio a good roommate?

1037
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,310
是个好人吗
A good person?

1038
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:46,440
我希望她也是这么看你的
I hope she feels the same about you.

1039
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:55,680
谢尔碧  你不会相信路上的交通...
Oh, Shelby, you wouldn't believe the traffic on the...

1040
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:58,240
你应该保持安静
You'll want to be quiet now.

1041
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,910
克劳迪娅.
Claudia.

1042
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,880
狱政局的某些机密资料
There are levels of clearance at the Department of Corrections.

1043
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,410
是无法触及到的
That are simply not available.

1044
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,680
即使我的那些无所不能的朋友也一样
Even for friends as connected as mine.

1045
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:10,710
所以  仔细听好了
So, listen carefully.

1046
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:15,080
如果对你的朋友的性命还有些许怜悯的话
If you even remotely value your friend's life.

1047
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,210
你就用你的安全密码进入...
You're going to use your security code to access...

1048
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,510
罪犯的转监记录
The records for prisoner transfers.

1049
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,310
告诉我迈克尔・斯科菲尔德...
And tell me where they sent...

1050
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,840
和林肯・布鲁斯被送到哪了
Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows.

1051
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,080
我帮你拿吧
I can take that for you.

1052
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,080
-谢谢  -不客气
-Thanks. -Sure.

1053
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:05,140
你的包真不错
That's a great bag.

1054
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,480
你从哪买的啊
Can I ask you where you got it?

1055
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,710
是老板送我的礼物
It was a gift from my boss.

1056
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,640
所以我也不知道  不好意思
So I don't really know, sorry.

1057
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,280
没关系  谢谢了
Sure, thanks.

1058
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,340
给你
There you go.

1059
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,640
我从来都买不到合适的包
I can never find a good bag.

1060
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:18,980
我是位老师  总要带很多书和卷子...
I'm a teacher, and I have books and grading materials and...

1061
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,910
我也许该买一个...
I should probably go ahead and just invest...

1062
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,110
像你那样的大包
In a wagon one of these days.

1063
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:25,210
是的  所以我喜欢这个包
Yeah, that's why I love this bag.

1064
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
有很多小口袋
It has so many pockets.

1065
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,910
我能看一下吗
Do you mind if I take a look?

1066
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,240
当然可以
Oh, no.

1067
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,740
谢谢
Thanks.

1068
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,980
感谢上帝  感谢上帝
Ah, thank God, thank God.

1069
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,480
你没事吧  先生
You all right, mister?

1070
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,880
是的  我那破车在几英里外抛锚了
Yeah, my damn truck blew a gasket a few miles back.

1071
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:03,140
之后我一路步行过来的
I've been, uh, hoofing it ever since.

1072
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,380
你要到哪去
Where you headed?

1073
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,510
圣地亚哥
San Diego.

1074
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,280
如果你想的话  我们可以载你一程
Hell, we can give you a ride, if you'd like.

1075
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,910
你没事吧  伙计
Hey, what's wrong, man?

1076
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,110
吃了墨西哥的烂食物了吗
Eat some bad Mexican?

1077
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,110
差不多吧
Something like that.

1078
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,310
跟昨天一样  很准时
Same as yesterday, right on schedule.

1079
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:33,510
希望那东西还在她的包里
I hope to hell she's still got that thing in her purse.

1080
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,480
塔克豪恩家
Tuxhorn residence.

1081
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,040
你好  我是保安公司的
Hello, I'm from the alarm company.

1082
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,910
我们从您家里接收到一些...
We've been receiving some, uh...

1083
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,980
奇怪的信号
Strange signals from your property.

1084
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:48,740
请您检查一下窗户好吗
We'd like you to check the windows, please.

1085
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,280
确保所有的警报装置都运行正常
Make sure all the contacts are still active.

1086
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,480
所有的窗户
All the windows?

1087
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,810
是的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

1088
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,210
房子里的每个房间
Every room in the house.

1089
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,410
好的  稍等
Okay, hold on.

1090
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,840
她还带着包吗
Does she still have the bag?

1091
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,140
是的
Yeah.

1092
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,610
收到信号了
She's got it.

1093
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,040
我正在接受房间里的所有信号  伙计
I'm picking up all kinds of gak from the house, man.

1094
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,640
小玩意  也许是数码相机  mp3播放器
Small stuff, maybe a digital camera, an MP3 player.

1095
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,580
还没有我们要找的东西
Nothing of the size of what we're looking for, though.

1096
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:21,680
让她继续走
Keep her moving.

1097
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:22,810
目前为止还不错  夫人
So far, so good, ma'am.

1098
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,040
请您去下一个房间
Uh, please move on to the next room.

1099
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,110
怎么样了
How we doing?

1100
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,410
还没找到
Still don't got it.

1101
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,810
如果卡在那里
If the card's in there.

1102
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,580
就该藏在安全的地方  比如保险箱
It'd be in some kind of, a safe.

1103
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,910
办公室
Office.

1104
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,040
夫人  我们的系统显示...
Ma'am, our system is showing...

1105
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,340
故障来自一间像是...
That the malfunction is coming from a room...

1106
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,380
办公室或书房的房间
That's designated as, uh, an office or a den.

1107
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,510
你说的是图书馆吗
You mean the library?

1108
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,180
先生不喜欢我去那里
Mister doesn't like me going in there.

1109
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:51,610
如果您没有设置好警报系统便下班回家的话...
Well, I think he'd like it even less if you went home...

1110
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,710
我想他会更加不高兴  您认为呢
Without properly setting the alarm first, don't you think?

1111
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,340
好吧  我去检查一下
All right, I'll check.

1112
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,110
有信号了
We got something.

1113
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,140
是卡吗
The card?

1114
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,380
是的
Oh, yeah.

1115
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,780
这么大的文件不可能是其他东西
File's so big it can't be anything else.

1116
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:07,940
现在你要把她留在那里2分钟...
Now you just gotta keep her there...

1117
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,510
保证完成数据传输
For two minute while it finishes the burn.

1118
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,210
拖住她  我们需要2分钟
Stall her, we need two minutes.

1119
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,480
夫人  我想我们找到问题所在了
Ma'am, I think we found the source of our problem.

1120
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,080
如果你能...
If you could just stay...

1121
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,710
在我们重启系统的过程中...
At that particular window and hold it closed...

1122
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:18,080
把窗户关上  保持紧闭  问题就能解决了
While we reset the system, that should do it.

1123
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,710
怎么样了  罗兰
Talk to me, Roland.

1124
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,510
马上就好  马上  马上
It's almost there, almost, almost.

1125
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,410
快  快  快
Come on, come on, come on.

1126
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,580
快
Come on.

1127
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,580
-完成了  -完成了
-Got it. -Got it.

1128
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,110
好了  夫人  非常感谢您的帮助
All right, ma'am, thank you so much for your help.

1129
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:00,440
我们现在要做的是...
All we need to do now, man, is just...

1130
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,580
不  她又回去了
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, she's heading back inside.

1131
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:05,340
-回去干嘛  -我不知道
-What for? -I don't know.

1132
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,680
不
Oh, no.

1133
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:11,840
不  没事
No, we're good.

1134
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,310
她出来了
She's out.

1135
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,110
站住
Hey, stop it!

1136
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,510
在这等着
Wait here.

1137
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,840
为了抓不到你  我不得不放慢脚步
I actually had to slow down not to catch you.

1138
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,980
我想我的腿拉伤了
I think I pulled a groin.

1139
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,010
不在包里
It's not in the bag.

1140
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,710
-不在这里  -怎么会不在这里
-It's not here. -How could it not be in here?

1141
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,580
那个接收器  不在包里  给我
The device, it's not here, give me it.

1142
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,210
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

1143
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:05,180
美国联邦监狱  利文斯顿  德克萨斯州
US Federal Penitentiary, Livingston, Texas.

1144
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:09,340
26  27  28
twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

1145
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,240
请讲
Go ahead.

1146
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,110
在布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德...
Before Burrows and Scofield...

1147
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:38,440
被转移到阿灵顿之前
Were allegedlly transferred to Arlington.

1148
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,240
有人替他们付了保释金
Someone posted their bail.

1149
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,780
我要知道这个人是谁
I need to know who.

1150
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:44,280
我查到是一个叫布鲁斯・班尼特的人
I'm showing a Bruce Bennett.

1151
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:46,810
弗兰克・唐克雷蒂州长的前任助手
Former aid to Governor Frank Tancredi.

1152
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,110
你们觉得那东西掉了吗
You think it fell out?

1153
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,410
我们找遍了
We looked everywhere.

1154
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,140
你们认为复制成功了吗
You think we got the thing copied?

1155
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,510
我说了  在成功下载数据之前...
Like I said, I can't read the content...

1156
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,610
我对内容也不得而知  但是...
Without downloading the device, but...

1157
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,740
除非塔克豪恩录制了5万个小时的节目
Unless this Tuxhorn's got, like, a 50,000-hour Tivo.

1158
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,040
否则的话  肯定是拷贝下来了
Then, yeah, I think we got it.

1159
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,810
除非找到接收器  否则是否拷贝下来毫无意义
Doesn't matter if we got it if we can't find it.

1160
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,510
接收器到底在哪
Where the hell is it?

1161
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,240
还在房子里
It's still inside the house.

1162
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,680
这就是女佣回去的原因
That's why the maid went back inside.

1163
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:24,740
她一定发现了
She must have found it.

1164
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,040
以为那是她老板的东西
Assumed it belonged to her boss.

1165
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,310
所以她就送回去了
And then she left it behind.

1166
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,010
你们猜如何  伙计们  游戏结束了
Well, then guess what, fellas, it's game over.

1167
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,110
你知道我为了做那个东西...
You know how many months...

1168
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,640
花费了多少时间吗  迈克尔
It took me to make that thing, Michael?

1169
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,180
怎么  你以为我几秒钟就能再做一个出来吗
What, you just think I can whip up another one in a couple seconds?

1170
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,380
丢了不是问题
Losing it is not the problem.

1171
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,280
如果他们发现了  那才是问题
If they find it, that's the problem.

1172
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:40,280
如果他们发现有人在找数据卡  我们就完了
If they find out someone was after that card, we're done.

1173
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,710
完了是什么意思  你说什么呢
What do you mean, done?  What does that mean?

1174
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,010
意思是说我们要回去蹲监狱了
Does that mean we're gonna go back to prison?

1175
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,080
还是他们要干掉我们
Are they gonna kill us?

1176
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:46,940
-到底是什么意思  -闭嘴
-What the hell does that mean? -Shut up!

1177
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,740
意味着我们要进去把它取回来
Means we go in and get it.

1178
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,640
如果我们有几天时间  就能找到解决的办法
If we had a few days, we'll figure out a way to pull this off.

1179
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:03,610
但我猜我们没有那么多时间了
But I gather we don't have that kind of time.

1180
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,110
是的  你猜的没错
Yeah, you gather right.

1181
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,710
听着  如果你想要我们把接收器拿回来
Look, if you want us to get that device out of there.

1182
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,840
你就得有所作为
You gotta throw us a bone.

1183
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,640
给我们些额外的帮助
Give us some extra help.

1184
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,180
你的要求  需要牵扯到其他的人
What you're asking for requires involving additional people.

1185
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,040
那样我们的行动便会暴露
Which given the covert nature of this operation.

1186
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,140
我做不到
I cannot do.

1187
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,440
那你的要求便是可望不可及
Then you're asking for the impossible.

1188
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,110
不  我的要求是努力  明白吗
No, what I'm asking for is competence, okay?

1189
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,980
我不会把整个任务的成功与否...
I'm not the one who put the entire mission...

1190
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:21,610
寄托在一个该死的女佣身上
In the hands of a damn maid.

1191
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:28,180
听着  如果公司先找到锡拉的拷贝
Look, if the Company finds that copy of Scylla before we do.

1192
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,340
那就完了  迈克尔  这是场竞赛
That's it, Michael, that's ball game.

1193
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,910
他们会找出幕后的人
They're gonna find out who was behind it.

1194
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:34,080
他们会干掉我们所有人
And they're going to ghost us.All of us.

1195
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:35,810
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1196
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,780
没事
Yeah.

1197
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,680
我没事
I'm fine.

1198
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,210
听着  我并不是手握你的把柄...
Look, I didn't choose you to do this

1199
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,380
逼着你做这个的
Because I had you in custody.

1200
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,980
我是因为相信你的能力才让你做的
I chose you to do this.Because I believed you could pull it off.

1201
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,310
是的  在过去的几个月里...
Yeah, well, a lot of people have believed in me...

1202
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,610
许多人都信任我  赛尔夫特工
In the last few months, Agent Self.

1203
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,340
他们都死了
Not all of them are alive today.

1204
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:01,510
你到底能不能把接收器拿回来
Can you get me back the device or not?

1205
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,440
好了  事情是这样的
All right, this is what we got.

1206
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,040
在女佣离开的时候  她发现了接收器
The housekeeper saw the device as she was leaving the house.

1207
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,910
然后她回到房子里15秒钟
Then she disappears back inside for 15 seconds.

1208
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,940
那么我们就知道它的位置了
So, we know, wherever it is.

1209
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,140
在门口附近
It's somewhere close to the door.

1210
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,440
所以15秒钟
So, 15 seconds.

1211
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,310
就是我们要争取到的时间
That's all we have to buy ourselves.

1212
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,640
我不确定我们可以多么接近房子
Listen, I'm not sure how close we're gonna get to this house.

1213
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,540
更别说潜入进去了
Let alone inside of it.

1214
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,810
即便我们做到了
But let's say that we do.

1215
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,580
房子配备的警报器会在任何窗户或门被...
The alarm they got installed in this house is triggered...

1216
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:29,580
非法闯入后的1.2秒发出警报
1.2 seconds after broken contact in any door or window.

1217
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,040
之后47个全副武装的...
Which would immediately send the private security guards...

1218
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,240
私人保镖便会立即冲入房子
With their 47 guns rushing into the property.

1219
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,880
30秒之后  保安公司...
And after 30 seconds, the alarm company...

1220
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:37,180
就会派车过去
Will dispatch vehicles to the property.

1221
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,710
三到四辆  视情况而定
Three to four, depending on availability.

1222
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,980
证实有人非法闯入之后
After confirmation of a break-in.

1223
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,340
他们会派更多的车来
They'll dispatch additional vehicles.

1224
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,740
封闭房子的所有出入口
To seal off any and all exits from the property.

1225
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,740
我不确定是否能行  迈克尔
I don't know about this, Michael.

1226
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,810
现在很明显...
It's getting pretty clear...

1227
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,840
他们为什么要找一帮罪犯来干这件事了
Why they hired a bunch of cons to do this job.

1228
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,980
他们不仅想要置身度外
It's not because they wanted it off the books.

1229
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,240
同时我们是毫无价值的
It's because we're expendable.

1230
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,680
谁会在乎一帮罪犯被杀呢
Who's gonna care if a bunch of crooks wind up dead?

1231
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,710
这是自杀行为
It's suicide.

1232
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,480
我会继续查看可能有用的信息
I'm gonna keep looking and see what I can find.

1233
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,840
奥德赛的片段
That quote from The Odyssey.

1234
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,140
怎么了
What about it?

1235
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,380
有一句不懂
I can't shake that line.

1236
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,540
飞行是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

1237
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,980
如果飞行是唯一的选择怎么办  林肯
What if flight is our only option, Linc?

1238
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,580
如果我们的父亲在调查了...
What if our father after everything he discovered...

1239
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,180
公司的一切之后  发现...
About the Company, what...

1240
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,610
发现飞行是唯一的办法
What if that's what he finally realized?

1241
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,940
知道吗  我记得关于爸爸最清楚的事...
You know, uh, the one thing I remember most...

1242
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,110
就是他的背影
About Dad was the back of his head.

1243
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,080
总是渐渐消失在大门口
Always walking out the front door.

1244
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:34,380
总是在逃避着什么
Always running from something.

1245
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,780
妈妈  我们  他自己
Mom, us, himself.

1246
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,480
但是他唯一没有逃避的事情...
But the one thing he never ran away from...

1247
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:42,440
就是公司一定得被搞垮的信念
Was his belief that the Company needed to be taken down.

1248
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,680
我们现在有机会去完成这个信念
And we got an opportunity to do that.

1249
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,940
那么这是我们的战斗  不是他们的
Then this is our fight, not theirs.

1250
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,010
兄弟  这不是福克斯河监狱
Man, this ain't Fox River.

1251
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,680
他们自己选择来这里
These guys chose to be here.

1252
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:55,010
记住这点
Remember that.

1253
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,640
他们自己的选择
They got a choice.

1254
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,610
-快了  -准备好了吗
-Almost. -Ready?

1255
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:44,220
走
Go.

1256
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,410
走
Go.

1257
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,680
快走  快走  快走
Let's go! Let's go! Go!

1258
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:31,210
快  我们走
Come on, let's go.

1259
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,200
声音从哪传来的
Where's it coming from?

1260
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,600
街对面的
It's across the street.

1261
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,980
走
Go.

1262
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,440
是街对面的问题
Just something across the street.

1263
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,140
我们派人过去检查了
We got a team checking it out now.

1264
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,910
您可以回去了  先生
You can go back inside, sir.

1265
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:15,440
他们一定是出城了
Must be out of town.

1266
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,140
爸爸  没事吧
Daddy, is everything okay?

1267
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,880
阿历克斯
Alex.

1268
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,540
谢谢  吉姆
Thanks, Jim.

1269
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,240
阿历克斯
Alex.

1270
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,010
我们快走
Let's go.

1271
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,580
走
Go!

1272
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,640
别回头
Don't turn around.

1273
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,840
除非你想在漫长的时间内...
Unless you'd like to experience a great deal of pain...

1274
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,080
品尝漫长折磨的滋味
Over an even greater length of time.

1275
01:17:34,110 --> 01:17:37,180
你想要什么  随便拿
You-you know, just-just take whatever you want here.

1276
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,680
我唯一想要的东西
The only thing I want from you.

1277
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:42,980
布鲁斯  是一个简单的问题的答案
Bruce, is the answer to a simple question.

1278
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:45,580
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德和林肯・布鲁斯在哪
Where are Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows?

1279
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,680
我只是通过报纸知道的...
I only know what-what I read in the papers and...

1280
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:48,680
三天前
Three days ago.

1281
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:52,640
美国德克萨斯州利文斯顿的联邦监狱里...
There were 105 inmates in the supermax wing...

1282
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:56,010
关押着105名囚犯
Of the U.S. penitentiary in Livingston, Texas.

1283
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,840
那两兄弟本该被送到那里
Where the brothers were allegedly sent.

1284
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,880
但那里还是只关押着105名囚犯
There are still 105 inmates there.

1285
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:04,940
那段时间里没人被释放
And no one has been released during that time.

1286
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,880
有人在导演一场骗局  布鲁斯
Someone is playing a shell game, Bruce.

1287
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:12,380
我只是要找出幕后主使
I'm just trying to find out who.

1288
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:14,610
我没有刑事司法管辖权
I have no criminal jurisdiction over.

1289
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,210
我知道你把他们保释出来了
I know you bailed them out.

1290
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,080
我知道你一直跟莎拉・唐克雷蒂有联系
I know you've been in contact with Sara Tancredi.

1291
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:24,180
我发誓  我真的不知道他们在哪
I swear to you, I've no idea where they are.

1292
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,780
我们走着瞧
I guess we'll see about that.

1293
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,340
祝你好运  泰迪
Good luck, Teddy.

1294
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,410
有你们这样的朋友  还需要好运气吗
Who needs luck when you got friends like you fellas, huh?

1295
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,380
我把这份旧报纸带走  你们不介意吧
Hey, you mind if I take this old newspaper of yours with me?

1296
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,640
没问题
No problem.

1297
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,310
对你的朋友我很遗憾  朋友
Sorry to hear about your friend, dude.

1298
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:51,080
没关系
It's all right.

1299
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:52,610
他活的很有价值
He had a full life.

1300
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:54,710
再见  泰迪
Later, Teddy.

1301
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,840
开始吧
There you go.

1302
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,510
Thirty-six.

1303
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,680
Twenty-four.

1304
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:37,080
Thirty-six.

1305
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,610
拿到了吗
Did you get it?

1306
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,480
确认一下是否有我们要的数据
Let's make sure we got what we wanted.

1307
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,940
-林肯  -怎么
-Linc. -Yeah.

1308
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,740
看好那东西
Don't let that thing out of your sight.

1309
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,440
好的
All right.

1310
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:33,340
我们胜利在望了
We're halfway there.

1311
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,480
我们只是进到房子里  拿走东西
All we got to do is that little B and E.

1312
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,610
然后我们就离开这里
And we're out of here.

1313
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,610
提醒我  我还得去联系赛尔夫...
Reminds me, I need to get ahold of Self...

1314
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,810
看我们时候能开始
See when we can get started.

1315
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,240
这一切结束之后你有什么打算
So what are you gonna do when all this is over?

1316
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,840
问的好
That's a good question.

1317
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,040
兄弟  不管锡拉是什么
Brother, whatever this Scylla thing is.

1318
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,880
它就是一堆乱码
It is a monster of a code.

1319
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,880
不
No.

1320
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:15,210
莎拉  我本想来问问你是否想跟我谈谈...
Sara, I was gonna come down here and ask if you...

1321
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,210
发生在巴拿马的事情
Wanted to talk some more about what happened in Panama.

1322
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:24,080
但我想我已经知道你的答案了
But, um, I think I already know what you're gonna say.

1323
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:25,180
为什么
How's that?

1324
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:28,280
因为你和我有些相似
Because you're a little like me.

1325
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:31,840
你会说你没事  你能处理好
Because you're gonna say you're fine, that you can handle it.

1326
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:34,440
所以...
So, um...

1327
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,110
我就不问了
I'll just leave it at this.

1328
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,010
我会陪你
I'm here.

1329
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,910
无论什么时候你想说了  我都愿意听
Whenever you want to talk, I'm here.

1330
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:46,610
谢谢
Thank you.

1331
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:54,980
当我被抓的时候  唯一令我...
You know that the only thing that kept me alive.

1332
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:58,080
坚持下去的信念就是能和你在一起
When I was being held was the thought of being with you.

1333
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,510
我知道如果我有什么三长两短
But I also knew that if anything happened to me.

1334
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,210
你就会责怪你自己
You were gonna blame yourself.

1335
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:06,080
整个下半生都会沉浸在深深的自责当中
You would spend the rest of your life punishing yourself for it.

1336
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:09,780
我想都不敢想
And, I can't bear the thought of that.

1337
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,640
所以我们现在算是扯平了好吗
So can we make a deal right now that we're even.

1338
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:22,740
往事一笔勾销  没有自责  没有责任
And just wipe the slate clean and no guilt and no responsibility?

1339
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,940
如果我们还能在一起
If we're gonna be together.

1340
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:27,240
我不希望你是出于为我负责的态度
I don't want it to be out of a sense of obligation.

1341
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,140
即使我们应该这样
Or-or even that we should be.

1342
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,680
因为我们经历了太多
Because of what we've been through.

1343
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:36,610
我只想重新开始
I just want to start over.

1344
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,440
重新开始
Start over.

1345
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,340
好的
Okay.

1346
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:45,640
这是否意味着我必须先离婚呢
But, does that mean I have to divorce my wife?

1347
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,780
你和那个俄罗斯脱衣女郎还是合法夫妻
Because you're still married to a Russian stripper.

1348
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:52,680
第一  我之前一直比较忙
Well, "A": I've been a little busy.

1349
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:55,680
第二  我很确定她是捷克人
And "B": I'm pretty sure she was Czech.

1350
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,610
迈克尔
Hey, Michael.

1351
01:22:58,780 --> 01:22:59,840
怎么了
What's wrong?

1352
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,680
不管它是什么  反正不对
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

1353
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,680
我不明白
I don't understand.

1354
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:04,540
我记得你说过  我们拷贝了那张卡
I thought you said we copied the card.

1355
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,610
是  没错
No, we did.

1356
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,210
但根据加密编码...
But according to the encryption code...

1357
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,380
我该怎么解释呢
Okay, how do I make this clear?

1358
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:13,480
假如说锡拉是块披萨  我们得到的只是一片
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got's a slice.

1359
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:15,580
剩下的数据在哪
So where's the rest of the data?

1360
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,880
我不知道  我不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

1361
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:17,980
我是说...
I mean...

1362
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,610
我不知道我们为什么看不全
I mean, I don't know how we didn't see this coming.

1363
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,680
应该是完全没有问题的
I mean, it-it makes perfect sense.

1364
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,410
这就像是核武发射码
It's like the nuclear launch codes.

1365
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,580
信息不可能只在一个人的手里
You don't give all that information to just one person.

1366
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:27,080
那会分给多少人
How many do you give it to?

1367
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,810
你父亲记录的奥德赛的那个片段说...
Okay, that quote your father held onto...

1368
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,310
锡拉是一只六头妖怪
In The Odyssey Scylla is a six-headed monster.

1369
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,110
想要通过就需要牺牲6位手下的生命
That requires a sacrifice of six soldiers in order to pass.

1370
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,010
这么说锡拉不只是一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card.

1371
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,310
是六张
It's six.

1372
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,410
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

1373
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,410
我们如何能找到剩下的5张
How we gonna find five more of these things?

1374
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,580
迈克尔  迈克尔
Michael! Michael!

1375
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:00,810
我很忙
I'm busy.

1376
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,280
我不在乎她现在怎么样了
I don't care what she looks like.

1377
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,180
三勺水
Three tablespoons of water.

1378
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,040
一勺蜂蜜
one of honey.

1379
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,210
就这些
Nothing more.

1380
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,880
即使她只知道哪怕是一点点的消息
If she knows something about anything that's going on.

1381
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:16,080
我也要知道
I'm going to find it.

1382
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,510
起床了  婊子
Rise and shine, bitch.

1383
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,340
吃早餐
Breakfast.

1384
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,640
迈克尔
Michael?

1385
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,740
迈克尔
Hey, Michael!

1386
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:07,380
你没事吧
You all right?

1387
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:09,880
没事  我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

1388
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,740
这些保护措施让你不禁联想...
All this security makes you wonder...

1389
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:12,780
公司到底在隐藏什么
What the Company's hiding.

1390
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:13,880
弄清真相的唯一办法就是...
Only way to know for sure...

1391
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,210
找到剩余的5张数据卡
Is to find those five other cards,

1392
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,610
我们自己看
See for ourselves.

1393
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,710
我们的时间够吗
Think we'll have enough time?

1394
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,140
够
Yeah.

1395
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,640
我们...
We'll, uh...

1396
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,340
会没事的
We'll be fine.
