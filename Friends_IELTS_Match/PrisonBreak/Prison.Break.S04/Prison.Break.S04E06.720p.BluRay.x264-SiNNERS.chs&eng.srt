00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,230
你能不能帮我
Why don't you help me find somebody

找个人解决我的问题 这样行了吧
who could help me sort all this out?How's that?

156
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,930
如果你不把手拿开
If you don't take your hands off me you're gonna

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,360
你会有比你老板更多的麻烦

163
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,900
因为我要把我的钱要回来
because I'm getting the money back

164
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,900
那匹马的门竟然卡住了
that I bet on the horse that got stuck in the gate.

165
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,100
你刚才看见了
Did you see that one? Yeah.

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,300
我说了 你不能在这里  我需要支援
I said you can't be back here! I need back up.

你好  妹妹

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,330
我们有问题了
We have an issue.

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,000
下午好  安迪
Good afternoon to you, too, Andy.

177
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,300
我刚才在查你
I've been reviewing your roster

178
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,560
东南区的销售单
from the Northeast division,

179
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,400
你的两个最大的买家的
and apparently two of your top buyers

180
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,700
社会保险号码是错的
don't have valid Social Security numbers.

181
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,630
能解释一下吗
Care to explain that?

182
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,800
我推销东西的时候
When I'm about to make a sale to a client,

183
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,830
我问我自己两个问题
I ask myself two questions:

184
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,900
这个对客户有用吗
"Is the client being helped?"

185
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,200
还有就是  我们能收到钱吗
and, "Are we gettin' paid?"

186
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,230
我当东北区最好的销售员
There's a reason

187
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,730
是有原因的
why I was the top seller in the Northeast.

188
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,660
我不拘小节
I don't get hung up on the details.

189
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,400
你的意思是
And what you're saying is...

190
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,400
在我的报表里有一两个错误是很正常的
There might be a typo or two in my reports,

191
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,600
但是我相信那些支票都兑现了
but I'm pretty sure those checks cleared.

192
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,400
嗯
Uh-huh.

193
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,700
好吧
Fair enough.

194
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,560
你早上一直很忙啊  弗兰克

It's not even lunchtime.

197
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,300
你想吓唬我
You're trying to put the fear of God into me.

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
你做到了
Mission accomplished.

199
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,660
听着  警官
Listen, Sergeant,

200
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,560
我对司法系统有一定的了解
I know a decent amount about the justice system,

201
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,130
如果你愿意
enough to know that if you wanted to,

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,230
现在不起诉我
you could drop this whole thing and...

203
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,930
大家都会少很多的麻烦
it would save a lot of trouble for everybody, huh?

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,900
这是什么电话
What kind of phone is this?

205
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,360
是一个日本牌子  黑市买的
It's a, a Japanese brand. Off market.

206
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,660
那你脚腕上的监视器又是怎么回事
What about the ankle monitor you're wearing?

207
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,030
我跟你说的都是实话
I've been on the straight and narrow,

208
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,330
这个东西过几天就会摘下来
and it's due to come off in a couple of days.

209
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,900
按个手印
Press your fingers in the ink.

210
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,160
我刚才烟瘾犯了  我是个大烟枪
I had two grand go up in smoke because of a bum gate.

211
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,700
我的意思是  我刚才有一些紧张
I mean, I got a little upset for a second.

212
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,960
你知道我什么意思  谁都会这么做的
You know what I mean? Who wouldn't?

213
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,060
我们谈谈吧
Let's talk about this.

214
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,400
那我们就谈谈你打了一个警察一拳
Should we talk about how you punched an officer first?

215
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,160
而且你还想逃跑  你自己选一个吧
Or how you tried to flee the scene?Pick a felony.

216
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,060
带他去拘留所
Take him to the holding cell.

217
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,200
你说他被抓了
What do you mean he got arrested?

218
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,690
出什么事了
W-What happened?

219
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,500
说来话长
It's a long story,

220
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,630
但是我们需要你把他和仪器都带出来
but we need you to get Mahone and the device out.

221
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,630
你能做到吗
Can you do that?

222
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,830
你以为每次你们出事故
What do you think,that every time you guys screw up,

223
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,030
我就能帮你们全搞定
I can just magically make things disappear?

224
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,730
我们不管你什么借口
We ain't interested in your excuses.

225
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,030
你能不能做到
Can you do it or not?

226
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,400
林肯  我过一会再打给你
Lincoln, y-you know what? I'll call you back.

227
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,630
对不起  你是谁
Excuse me.Who are you?

228
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,500
-你在干什么  -我是布莱恩  IT组的
-What is this? -I'm Brian.I work in the IT department.

229
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
我们在服务器上发现
We were getting some registry inconsistencies

230
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,030
有些和登记不一样的地方
on the server, so...

231
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,530
我只是进行例行测试
I'm just running a few routine spot checks.

232
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,860
你不问问我就进来了
So you just barge in here without asking?

233
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,160
我有二级许可  看到没  这是我的工作
I have level two clearance. See?It's what I do.

234
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,630
我进大家的办公室  我修理电脑
I go into people's offices, I fix their computers.

235
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
我觉得你不在的时候把东西修好更好一点
I just figured it was better to do it when you weren't here.

236
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,100
告诉你  你现在就给我出去
Well, you know what? You got to go.

237
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,430
别再进来了
Don't come back in here.

238
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,600
没问题  我全搞定了
Sure thing.You're all set.

239
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,360
-怎么说  -赛尔夫正想办法
-So what's the word? -Self's on it.

240
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,400
意思是  他会把马宏弄出来
On it, as in he's getting Mahone out?

241
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
他说他来解决这个问题
He said he'd handle it.

242
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,730
有什么要解决的
What's there to handle?

243
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
我们这么大罪赛尔夫都能把我们弄出来
Self yanked us all out of prison for way bigger charges.

244
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,630
搞定马宏的事  不是更简单吗
Getting Mahone out should be easy, shouldn't it?

245
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,130
是啊
Yeah.

246
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,500
我们还是来找下一个持卡人吧
Let's concentrate on finding the next cardholder.

247
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,230
一旦我们拿回仪器  就继续复制
As soon as we get the device back, we'll move forward.

248
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,500
你能告诉我们  我们现在都知道什么吗
Would you please walk us through what we know so far?

249
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,900
好的
Sure.

250

在老挝有大量的不动产
It actually has huge holdings in Laos,

253
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,800
而且现在还有通货膨胀
which, given the current inflation,

254
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,960
意味着他们赚钱易如反掌
means that they are making money hand over fist.

255
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,430
我的朋友在公园里玩
"My friends are playing at the park."

256
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,130
亲爱的  你先去房间里
Sweetheart, why don't you go play in your room

257
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,630
玩一会吧  好吗
for a little bit, okay?

258
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:27,430
-现在感觉如何  -好多了

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,460
-我给你做了个三明治  -谢谢
-I, I made you a sandwich. -Thank you.

260
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,460
你不告诉我发生了什么吗
Um, you never explained what happened.

261
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,700
这样的
Well, um...

262
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,660
我的车在沙漠中坏了
my car broke down in the middle of the desert, and, uh...

263
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,600
而且附近都没有人  我的手机又没电了
there was no one around for miles,my cell phone was dead

264
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,000
所以我就走来了  你有没有留着我在德国
So I walked here. Hey, do you still have that owl

265
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
给你寄的那只猫头鹰
that I sent from Germany?

266
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,330
留着
Yeah.

267
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,700

Thank you.

269
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,730
我的天啊  格雷琴
Oh, my God, Gretchen!

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,760
这个  这个是真的枪吗
Is that, is that, that a real gun?

271
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,830
是的
It is.

272
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,130
-你为美国国税局工作吗  -不是
-You don't work for the IRS? -I don't.

273
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,360
那你为谁工作
Who do you work for?

274
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,660
现在  我为自己
As of now? Myself.

275
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,130
他就读于长岛的杜鲁大学法学院
He attended Touro Law School in Long Island.

276
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,030
在02年进去国土安全局之前
He spent the next 18 years

277
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,960
他在内务部
bouncing around the D.O.J. and D.O.D. before being

278
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,330
和国防部呆了18年
dumped on the doorstep of Homeland in '02.

279
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,530
进来
Come in.

280
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,330
将军
General.

281
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,430
你发现什么了
What did you find out?

282
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,900
我尝试进去他的用户账户
I tried accessing Self's user account,

283
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,200
但他有一个非常复杂的防火墙系统
but he has a tricky firewall system in place.

284
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,660
不是很容易破解  除非
There's no easy way to get past it,not without...

285
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,400
我们花点精力
drawing attention.

286
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,030
所以我们仍然不知道他为什么对我感兴趣
So we still don't know why he's interested in me.

287
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,500
我需要更多的时间
Well, uh... maybe if you gave me more time.

288
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,330
让我来吧
I'll look into it.

289
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,660
听着  他对我很重要
Look, he's important to me.

290
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,160
他为我工作
Okay, he's doing a job for me.

291
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,230
你手下当着我的面  殴打我的人
Yeah, well, your CI punched one of my officers in the face.

292
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,530
我明白
I understand...

293
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,130
你要庆幸的是他不会受到很重的指控
You're lucky he's not being charged with worse.

294
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,100
我替他向你道歉  好吗
I apologize for him.Okay?

295
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,760
我想你帮我个忙
Look, I-I'm asking for a favor here,

296
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,200
好吗  看在我们是同行
okay, from one badge to another.

297
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,260
你最后一次审视你的徽章是什么时候
When was the last time you looked at your badge?

298
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,000
我很清楚自己的是由洛杉矶颁发
'Cause I'm pretty sure mine says issued by the

299
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,330
而不是由联邦政府颁发的
City of Los Angeles not the federal government,

300
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
-除非你有法院的命令  -嘿
So unless you get a court order that... -Hey, hey!

301
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,100
你要按照程序来吗  你要耍小聪明吗
You want to go that route? You want to get smart?

302
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,860
当你和你的情人见面返回后
Huh? Want to get detained at the Guadalajara airport

303
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,700
你想要在瓜达拉哈拉机场被拘留吗
when you're coming back from visiting your nana?

304
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,860
这听起来怎么样
How does that sound?

305
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,460
你有听过禁飞名单吗
Huh? You ever hear of a no-fly list?

306
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,530
这是我部门可以做到的事情  明白吧
That's what my badge could do.Okay?

307
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,430
还想知道其他我能做的吗
Want to see what else it could do?

308
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,600
我都有些担心了
I was starting to worry.

309
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,930
-签了这个  -好的
-Sign these. -Yeah.

310
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,930
-这个不是释放令  -我需要你签了它
-These aren't release papers. -Well, I need you to sign that

311
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,500
我才可以收集的你个人的
so I can collect your personal...

312
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,800
-他们要查我的指纹  -你刚打了一个警察
-They're gonna run my prints, and once they... -You punched a cop.

313
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,760
-是的  为了完成任务  -小声点  好吗
-Yeah, trying to save the mission. -Keep your voice down.Okay?

314
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,300
我已经尽力了
I did the best I could do.

315
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,100
你签了这个  我才可以拿到罗兰的设备
You need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device.

316
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,830
你是要我放弃
You... you want me to give up the one thing

317
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,300
我存在在这个组的意义
that makes me valuable to the team.

318
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,660
你加入的时候就应该知道了
Yeah, you knew the deal when you came on board.

319
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,160
为了这个我们都牺牲了很多
Okay, we all sacrificed a lot to get this far.

320
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,400
就因为你的行为
You want to flush it down the toilet

321
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,800
你想让这一切白费吗
because you made a bad move?

322
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,530
明白了
Got it.

323
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,300
赛尔夫拿到了设备  马宏还在监狱里
Self got the device.Mahone's still in jail.

324
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,930
可马宏是我们组的一员啊
But Mahone-- he-he's part of the team.

325
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
曾经是
Was.

326
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,000
对于他还有他的孩子  我和你们一样感到悲伤
Look, I feel just as bad about his kid as everyone else,

327
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,760
但我们不能为一个人而放弃任务
but we can't blow this mission on one person.

328
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,760
这样吗
Oh, yeah?

329
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,000
那么如果我明天被关了
So if I get popped tomorrow,

330
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,800
你们也这样放弃我
you guys are just going to forget about me?

331
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,800
是的
Yeah.

332
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
听着
Hey, listen.

333
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,300
有个杀手正在追杀我们
An assassin is trying to hunt us down, okay?

334
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,160
而通往城堡的钥匙以及
And that T-Bag character is out in the wind

335
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,530
蒂博格都还不知所踪
with the keys to the castle.

336
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,830
我们的问题已经够多了
We got enough problems

337
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
不要在想那个关押在监狱里的混蛋了
without having to worry about this guy's ass in jail.

338
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,500
你他妈给我闭嘴
You shut up.

339
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,730
好了
Okay.

340
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
阿历克斯用了假名  如果他们查他的指纹
Alex has an alias, but if they run his prints,

341
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,330
-他就知道他是  -不  如果
-they're gonna find out that he's... -Not if--

342
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,960
当他们查到他的指纹 他们就会查出他是谁
when they run his prints, they gonna figure out who he is

343
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,960
并且查明他应该呆在重刑监狱
and that he's not in a supermax like he's supposed to be,

344
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,630
他们不会意识到我们没
and then they're gonna realize  we're not...

345
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
迈克尔
Michael.

346
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,200
林肯说的对
Linc's right.

347
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,660
我们别无选择  我们按原计划行事
We don't have a choice.We move forward with the plan.

348
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,230
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self.

349
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,500
我是克兰兹将军的人
I'm an associate of General Krantz.

350
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,130
将军得到消息说
Word has gotten back to the General

351
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,960
你正在查他
that you've been pulling information on him.

352
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,160
赛尔夫先生  你为什么要如此
Why is that,Mr. Self?

353
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,530
我是国土安全局的
I'm Homeland Security.

354
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,760
我的工作就是保护像克兰兹这样
It's my job to protect people

355
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,830
是恐怖分子的首要攻击目标
who make attractive terrorist targets--

356
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,130
处于高度军事危险的人  免受伤害
people in upper ranks of military people like Krantz.

357
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,660
能告诉我具体是什么威胁吗?
Is there a particular threat I should know about?

358
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,500
或许你可以和我汇报下这个情况
Maybe you can debrief me on the situation.

359
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,100
你是哪个部门的
What's your division?

360
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,000
你能否出示下你的通行证等级
You want to give me your clearance level?

361
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:27,360
-我直接受雇于将军  -好吧
-I'm a... hired contractor.  -Right.

362
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,400
我通常不会把机密信息
Well,I usually don't make a habit of giving civilians who

363
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,030
透露给在地下停车场
corner me in underground parking structures

364
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,730
逼问我的平民  懂了吗?
classified information.Okay?

365
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,160
如果将军还有其他疑问  让他打电话给我
So if the General has a problem,he can call me.

366
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,730
你还有什么要对我说的吗?
Is there something else you want to say to me?

367
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,460
我想我们的首次交谈还算顺利
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

368
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,030
我只是来给你点友情建议
I'm just here to give you a little friendly advice.

369
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,600
什么建议?
What's that?

370
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,200
将军喜欢有自己的隐私
The General-- he likes his privacy.

371
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
仅此而已
That's all.

372
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,500
洛杉矶警局 停车场 11号

373
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,100
没错 他就是怀特
Yes, that was Wyatt.

374
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,900
我告诉你这个是因为
I gotta tell you,I'm not a big fan

375
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,930
我不想被人爆了头
of almost catching a bullet in my head.

376
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
现在你该知道这种感受了吧
Well,now you know what it's like.

377
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,060
你了解马宏多少
So,how well do you know Mahone?

378
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,900
我只知道他想搞垮"公司"就像我们那么强烈
I know he wants to take down the Company just as much as we do.

379
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
你还知道他是负有重大责任
You also realize he's a major liability.

380
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,160
我的意思是  如果怀特能找到我  他也能找到马宏
I mean,if Wyatt could find me,he could find Mahone.

381
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,300
并且...
And then people...

382
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,030
-那就把他弄出监狱  -我说了我做不到
-So get him out. -I told you I can't.

383
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,100
但是我能找到他  我是说我能联系上他
But I can get to him.I mean,he can be touched.

384
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,900
我也不知道 或许马宏是条汉子
I don't know,maybe Mahone is a stand-up guy.

385
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,060
或许他会供出我们来达到他的目的
Or maybe he likes to run his mouth to work an angle,

386
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:07,400
我不确定  但如果需要的话  我能除掉他
I'm not sure.But if need be,I can get rid of that angle.

387
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,800
-我能终结了这个威胁  -不予考虑
-I can eliminate that threat.-That's not an option.

388
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,800
不  考虑一下
Oh,yes it is.Okay,

389
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,200
因为如果要你选  是杀了他还是我们全玩儿完...
because if a choice has to be made between him or us...

390
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,530
弗兰克  给你带好消息来了
Hey,Frank.Got some good news.

391
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,960
是吗  什么好消息
Oh,yeah,what's that?

392
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,000
我能放了你
I can cut you a break.

393
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,030
就这么简单吗
As easy as that?

394
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,360
我和那个地铁站经理说过了
Spoke with the manager down at the racetrack.

395
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,500
他说一个比你小10岁左右的
Said you were spotted with another male Caucasian

396
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,530
白种人和你一起到过那
about ten years your junior.

397
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,460
说的没错吧
That sound about right?

398
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,300
警察来了
Here come the cops.

399
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,600
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

400
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,930
到底怎么回事
What was it?

401
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,960
你们两个在那准备袭击押运车
The two of you were gonna go in there,rob the vault?

402
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,700
抢了现金就跑对吗
Grab as much cash and get out?

403
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,730
总得有个望风的
Someone has to be lookout.

404
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
我会看着的 快走!
I'll take care of it. Go!

405
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,330
瞧  或许你妻子正在家里等着你
Look.Maybe you got a wife to get home too.

406
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,330
你的整个家都在等你
Family.

407
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,700
如果你愿意供出你的同伙
If you're willing to give me the name of your accomplice

408
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,130
我想我们可以减轻对你的指控
I think we can change your charges.

409
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
我们是一伙的 你知道
I thought we worked together,you know.

410
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,500
-互相帮助  -你得靠你自己了
-Help each other out.-You're on your own.

411
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,560
如果你改变主意了就叫我
You holler if you change your mind.

412
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,230
现在我们谈谈这第五个持卡人
All right,let's talk about the fifth cardholder.

413
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,400
将军正要求
The General is requiring

414
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,560
所有持卡人必须把卡时刻带在自己身边
all the cardholders to have their cards on them at all times,

415
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,560
所以斯库得利也一定把卡带在身上
so Scuderi will have his card,too.

416
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,900
斯库得利的保安时刻巡视着他房子的四周
Now,Scuderi has major security around his house.

417
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,560
大围墙围着他的房子  还有一群狗看着
Big fence,lots of guard dogs.

418
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,200
文件在哪
Where are the documents?

419
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,860
这些是从县督察员办公室拿来的
These are from the county surveyor's office.

420
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,760
这是他房子的布局图
It shows the layout of his property,

421
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,930
以及他接近街道处的所有建筑
and its proximity to every other house on his street.

422
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,960
他有着绝对顶级的
He has-- surprise,surprise--

423
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,960
电子警报系统
a top of the line electronic alarm system

424
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,300
一旦有人入侵  警报就会启动
that will alert him if there's a breach in the structure.

425
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,730
如果我切断电源  警报就会消除
If we cut the power-- the alarm goes off.

426
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,600
如果我们用突增的瞬间电压  增加电力供应
if we double the power with a voltage spike

427
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,860
这个警报系统会为了保护自身装置
the alarm system,in order to protect itself

428
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,930
免受超载 它会自动关闭
against an overload, will shut itself down.

429
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,100
我们就那么进去
And that's how we're getting in.

430
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,130
然后呢
Then what?

431
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,030
我知道该怎么做  每人搞定自己那部分
Look, I know what the score is.It's every man for himself.

432
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,560
你慢了就完蛋  真他妈难搞
You get left behind you get locked up.Tough titties.

433
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,060
现在我跟其他人一样都签了字
Now, I signed on the dotted line

434
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,530
我想清楚的知道
like everyone else and I want to know exactly

435
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,760
我该做什么
what I'm doing on this job.

436
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,800
我和贝里克一起
I'm with Bellick on this one.

437
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,760
我觉得在警察来之前
You know, maybe

438
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,500
我们得有个计划
we should have a plan for when the cops get here

439
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,260
因为如果马宏告密的话他们很快就会回来
'cause if Mahone squeals they're gonna come real quick.

440
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,500
他是联邦政府官员  你觉得他一生中
He's a Fed-- how many deals

441
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,460
作过多少交易
do you think this guy's made in his life?

442
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,330
你觉得他会夹起尾巴
You think he's just gonna tuck tail between his...

443
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
闭嘴
Shut up.

444
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,160
我们大可以在这坐着讨论一天
Look, we can sit here and debate

445
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,000
看马宏会做或不会做什么
what Mahone is or is not gonna do for the rest of the day,

446
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,230
但问题是
but it comes down to this:

447
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,130
我们不能把他从警局给弄出来
we cannot break him out of a police station.

448
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,760
一  二
One... two...

449
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,260
三  四  五  六
three, four, five, six--

450
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,300
不  太大了
No. Too big.

451
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,330
八乘以十
Eight by ten.

452
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,530
这是我能弄到的最低限度
This is the lowest gauge I could get.

453
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,030
好极了
It's perfect.

454
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,900
我觉得  我觉得我们只能让他呆监狱里了
I guess, uh...I guess we're gonna leave him in jail.

455
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,200
你是在陈述还是在问
Is that a statement or a question?

456
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,700
如果阿历克斯有什么事的话
It's just if something happens to Alex--

457
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,500
如果公司找到他
if, uh, if the Company finds him...

458
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,760
如果角色互换  换做是你被抓
If the roles were reversed and you were the one locked up,

459
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,930
你觉得阿历克斯会冒险来救你吗
you really think Alex would risk it all to get you out?

460
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,930
我不知道
I mean, I don't know.

461
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,760
但是  他是联邦探员
But...he was a federal agent.

462
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,100
我觉得他会有始有终
I think he'd finish what he started.

463
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,560
我相信他会设法搞垮公司
I think he'd bring the Company down.

464
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,760
有什么能帮您吗
Can I help you with something?

465
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,360
我是来找弗兰克・斯万的
Yes, I-I'm here to see Frank Zwan.

466
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,730
我是他们家世交
I'm a family friend.

467
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,600
恐怕你现在不能见他
I'm afraid you can't see him right now.

468
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,630
他正要接受传讯
He's about to be transferred for his arraignment.

469
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,460
我是想来提供精神支持的
Actually, I'd like to be there for moral support.

470
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,760
能告诉我法庭在哪吗
Could you tell me where's the court house?

471
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,200
喂
Hello?

472
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,730
迈克尔
Michael.

473
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,030
阿历克斯  很抱歉
Alex, look, I'm sorry.

474
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,030
他发现我了
He found me.

475
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,660
怀特  他出现在警局
Wyatt-- He showed up at the station house

476
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,630
他们抓住了我  我不知道他怎么找到我的
where they're holding me. I don't know how he did it.

477
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,100
不知道他怎么查出来了
I don't know how he figured it out.

478
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
我打电话给赛尔夫
Let me call Agent Self.

479
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,200
不  迈克尔  听着
No, Michael, listen...

480
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,630
不  可能他们会转移你
No, maybe he can get you moved.

481
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,100
我完了  全完了
It's-it's over for me. It's done.

482
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,060
我什么都不会说的
It's-- and I'm not gonna say anything about anything.

483
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,360
但你得答应我件事  可以吗
But you need to promise me something, okay?

484
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,200
-好的  是什么  -答应我
-Okay, what? -Promise me...

485
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,230
你去找怀特  杀了那狗娘养的
that you will get to Wyatt and you'll kill the son of a bitch.

486
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,830
然后打电话给帕姆
And then you'll call Pam

487
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,500
告诉她我死了
and you'll tell her that he's gone.

488
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,300
好的
All right.

489
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,330
我答应你
I promise.

490
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
好  再见
Ok. Bye.

491
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:49,560
准备好了吗  迈克尔
You ready to go?Michael?

492
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,860
我是他老婆
I'm his wife.

493
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,360
抱歉  我还是没很震惊
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still in shock.

494
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,360
我下午过来
I'll be down this afternoon.

495
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,530
谢谢
Thank you.

496
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
你到底在干嘛
Who are you?

497
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,460
我有事要处理
I just have some things I need to take care of.

498
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,500
你不用担心
You don't need to worry.

499
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,360
你总是把人拒之于外
You have this...switch inside you.

500
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,360
我不知道你是怎么会
I don't know how you could just...

501
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,430
自我封闭起来的
shut yourself off.

502
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,430
妈妈死的时候你这样  对艾米丽也是这样
You did it when Mom died.Did it with Emily.

503
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,300
这么对我
Did it with me.

504
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:37,560
我这么做是因为  我就是这样的
I do it because it's...it's just who I am.

505
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,800
不  不是的  以前你

我得走了  但谢谢你  为了这一切
I have to go.But thank you... for everything.

507
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,460
你不是来带她走的
So, you're not here to take her?

508
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,730
如果我能个好母亲
If I was capable of being her mother,

509
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,500
我就不会把监护权给你了
I wouldn't have given you custody.

510
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,200
你会听话的  是不是
You be a good girl, okay?

511
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,500
-艾米丽  再见  -婶婶再见

-我们还能再见面吗  -我不知道
-Will we see you again? -I don't know.

514

要是去南边就给我电话
Call me if it goes south.

515
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,860
亲爱的  是我  我在杂货店

我打算做烤猪排
I was planning to make those grilled pork chops,

517
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,860

怎么了
What's that?

526
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,230
有什么能效劳的
What can I do you for?

527
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,400
我刚刚发现了更多不一致的地方
I just-- I've found some more inconsistencies

528
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,630
你的销售报告里  实际上  非常多
in your sales reports.Actually, many more.

529
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,800
事实上  有点像是欺诈
In fact...kind of looks like fraud, actually.

530

我从一开始就知道你很垃圾
I knew you were rotten from the beginning.

531

我要你5分钟内到我办公室

532
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,260
给我解释清楚
to walk me through this,

533
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,460
你要是做不到
and if you can't,

534
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,060
我就打电话给当局
well, I'm gonna call the authorities.

535
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,230
你在干什么
What are you doing?

536

我要看到证明

我才能签字移交他的私人物品给你
so I can sign over his personal belongings to you.

544
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,700
你跟你爱人的姓氏不同
So... you and your spouse had different last names?

545
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,030
没错
That's correct.

546
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,260
我知道这很麻烦
I realize this is an inconvenience,

547
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,460
但我得看到其他能证明

你知道我经历过什么事吗
Do you have any idea what I've been through?

好了  我们走
All right,Let's get out of here.

572
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,800
我不知道你们...
I don't know if, uh, you guys...

573
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,700
这么做是为了队伍还是为了我  而且...
did this for the team or if you did it for me, and...

574
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,530
我不在乎
I don't care.

575
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,630

我还在想你什么时候会回电话
I was wondering when you were going to call.

580
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,700
你跟我妻子说你要我自投罗网
You told my wife you wanted me to turn myself in.

581
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,650
那你为何不告诉我去哪能和你见面
So, uh, why don't you tell me where to go and I'll meet you?

582
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,300
我们做个了断
Let's get this over with.

583
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,730
这件事可没那么快了结  阿历克斯

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,130
首先  我在这找到莎拉・唐克雷蒂

你曾为公司卖过命  阿历克斯
You worked for the Company once, Alex.

591
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,330
你应该知道不能太感情用事

我会把这个收拾掉
I'm gonna wrap this up,

593
