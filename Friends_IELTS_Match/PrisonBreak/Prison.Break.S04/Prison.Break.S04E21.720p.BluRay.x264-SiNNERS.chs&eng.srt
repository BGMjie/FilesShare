Previously on Prison Break.

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,610
我把 信寄给你
When I sent you the envelopes

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,830
可不是闹着玩的
I wasn't just playing games.

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,110
靠近4号目标
Move on subject 4

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,930
执行命令
Execute the order.

7
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,780
求你不要这样做
Please don't do that.

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,070
你想要参与到这次行动中  现在机会来了
You wanted to get in on the action, here's your chance.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,370
7.5亿美元的已经汇到卢森堡的一个帐户上了
3/4 of a billion dollars in a numerical account in Luxembourg.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,260
所有数据将会在24小时内传输完毕
All the data will be delivered within 24 hours.

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,960
箱子给我
Case.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,790
我来拿
I'll take that.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,870
老妈  你好啊
Hi, mom.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,210
我知道锡拉在你手上  把锡拉给我
I know you have it. Bring me scylla.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,000
否则这次莎拉就真得死了
Or this time sara's death will not be faked.

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,350
看来你要做出抉择了
Looks like you have a little decision to make.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,000
锡拉  还是你爱的人
Scylla -- or someone you Love.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,590
好好考虑考虑  迈克
Just think this through, michael.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,110
我考虑过了  两个人我们都要救
I have, and we're saving them both.

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,140
你怎么救?
How?

21
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,080
我会想出来的
I'll figure it out.

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,640
你哥哥快要失血过多而死了
Your brother is bleeding to death.

23
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,950
我想知道能不能把林肯和莎拉集中到一个地方
I wonder if we can bring lincoln and sara to the same place.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,280
现在你唯一的优势就是两方都不知道
Right now your only advantage is that neither party knows

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,780
还有另一方手握你的人质
That there's another player that has leverage on you.

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,820
如果你把两人了集中到一起
You bring them both together

27
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,170
你就失去了战术优势
You'll lose your tactical edge.

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,490
我不会丢下莎拉的
I am not abandoning sara

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,510
我没让你那么做
I didn't say to do that

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,440
我的意思是...
What I am say is...

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,100
莎拉有没有中弹这个优势
sara has the advantage of not having a bullet in her chest.

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,980
一个一个来
One at a time.

33
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,550
令人吃惊
Big surprise.

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,530
蠢的那个被捉住了  聪明的那个逃跑了
The dumb one got caught, the smart one got away.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,210
我都能总结出规律了
I'm beginning to see a pattern here.

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,050
他不会给你的
He's never going to give it to you.

37
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,950
我不这么认为  他真的很关心你
I disagree. He truly cares for you.

38
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,470
虽然事实证明你并不值得
No matter how many times you've shown you don't deserve it.

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,740
你们两个真是
You know, you two are truly

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,170
先天和后天因素影响的经典案例
A classic study nature versus nurture.

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,540
同样的环境  同样的父母
Same environment, same parents

42
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,640
你们却完全不同
You're completely different.

43
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,080
你觉得是为什么呢  林肯
Why do you think that is, lincolnoln?

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,050
因为他们的妈妈是个疯婆子
Because mom's a psychotic bitch.

45
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,700
你好啊  迈克
Hello, michael.

46
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,870
好吧  你赢了  我把锡拉给你
All right, you win. I'll give you scylla.

47
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,730
林肯需要什么就给他什么
Just give lincoln whatever he needs.

48
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,620
我还没得到我需要的东西呢
Not until I get what I need.

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,340
爱迪生装箱区B码头
Edison shipping yard, B dock,

50
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,900
45分钟内到达 带上我哥哥
45 minutes.and bring my brother

51
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,780
45分钟?  近一点
45 minutes? Cutting it close.

52
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,280
他看起来可不太妙
He doesn't look so good.

53
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,350
到那儿就是了
Just be there.

54
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,240
你觉得值吗  莎拉
Is it worth it, sara?

55
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,320
你有没有回想过那个晚上
You ever go back to that night

56
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,750
想过如果你当时
And wonder how things would have gone

57
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,490
锁了医务室的门  事情会变成怎样
If you had just left that infirmary door locked?

58
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,090
那些人的本来可以活下来的
All the people whose lives would have been saved.

59
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,480
你爸爸也是
Hell, your father would still be alive.

60
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,500
你有没有想到过这一点
You ever think about that?

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,840
现在既然迈克要把锡拉还给我了
And now that michael's returning scylla to me

62
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,280
你们这一切就白忙活了
It was all for nothing.

63
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,000
如果他真还给你了
Assuming he does return it.

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,630
如果情况相反  如果是迈克被抓了
If the situation were reversed, if michaelwere here

65
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,640
你手上有锡拉
And you were holding scylla,

66
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,170
你会怎么做
What would you do?

67
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,680
你会把锡拉带来的
You'd bring it back

68
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,990
和你没锁门是一个原因
For the same reason you left that door unlocked.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,960
因为你不能眼睁睁看着无辜的人死掉
Because you couldn't let an innocent man die.

70
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,530
你的情感左右了你的理性判断
Your heart betrays your better judgment.

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,410
斯科菲尔德也是这样
So does scofield's.

72
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,070
你猜的没错
You know, you're probably right.

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,590
因为迈克从你鼻子底下把锡拉拿走的那天晚上
Because if michaelused his better judgment the night he

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,050
他如果理性判断的话
Stoll scylla out from under your nose

75
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,190
就会把你杀了
He would have killed you.

76
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,160
不要让我看见她
Get her out of my sight.

77
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,960
牵着
Take it.

78
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,630
要么你牵着我的口袋  要么我就牵你的
Either take my pocket or I take yours.

79
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,780
明白么
Understand?

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,360
当局正在街上进行地毯式搜查
The authorities are blanketing the streets

81
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,250
以搜寻主要嫌疑人
Looking for the primary suspects

82
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,240
林肯・布伦斯和迈克斯科菲尔德
lincoln・Burrows and michaelscofield.

83
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,870
因近几年来发生的
The brothers famous for

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,810
最胆大妄为的越狱行为而出名的
One of the most daring prison breaks in recent history

85
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,240
这对兄弟携有枪支并且极度危险
Are considered armed and extremely dangerous.

86
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,840
自制炸弹
Homemade explosives?

87
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,340
你有更好的主意吗
You got a better idea?

88
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,800
也许救你哥  救所有人  最好的方法是
Maybe the best way to save lincoln, to save everyone

89
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,100
给克里斯蒂娜她所想要的东西
Is to give christina what she wants.

90
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,500
我只是想找出一个保证我们挚爱的人
I am just trying to find a way where the people that we love

91
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,780
的安全的方法
don't end up in a autopsy table.

92
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,230
我不会让这件事发生的
And I am not.

93
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,970
你没弄错吧  阿历克斯
Better get your story straight, Alex.

94
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,240
你一直在说服我
This whole time you've been saying

95
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,730
把锡拉还给将军
You should give scylla back to the general.

96
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,310
你没听见他对赛尔夫的妻子做了什么吗
Didn't you hear what he did to self's wife?

97
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,580
赛尔夫自己自作自受
self made his own bed.

98
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,290
对  我们要收拾他的烂摊子
Yeah, we're sleeping with in it.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,880
让我们想想  最好的结局
Let's say best case scenario.

100
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,120
我们也许能找到林肯和莎拉
Maybe somehow we're able to get to lincoln and sara.

101
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,480
然后呢
Okay. What then?

102
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,190
将军还派人监视着我的妻子
General've still got somebody watching my wife.

103
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,870
要怎么样保证她的安全?
What's the plan to keep her safe?

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,990
L.J呢?  又要怎么样保证他的安全?
What about L.J? What's the plan to keep him safe?

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
我现在考虑不到那么多
I can't thingk about that right now.

106
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,250
也许我们应该找你妈谈个条件
Maybe we go to your mother and try to make a deal.

107
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,600
她和将军是死对头了
I mean, there's no love lost with her and the general.

108
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,860
如果我们给她锡拉
With her contracts, if we give her scylla

109
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,300
有她的关系网络也许她能找到...
Maybe she can find out where the agents...

110
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,110
我们不会要调查  我们不会把锡拉还回去的
We're not finding out and not giving it back.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,640
我们会救出所有人
We're going to save everyone.

112
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,600
你怎么会在这儿
What the hell are you doing here?

113
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,450
我怎么会在这儿
What am I doing here?

114
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,630
你在这儿康复  赛尔夫先生
You're in recovery, Mr. self.

115
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,460
看来你摔得不轻
Apparently you had quite a fall.

116
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,810
幸运的是有人发现了你并且报了警
Luckily someone found you and called 9-1-1.

117
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,400
他们做什么了
They did what?

118
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,570
医生马上就到  来查看你的历史记录
The doctor will be in shortly to go over your history.

119
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,480
不要  不要
No, no.

120
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,460
叫医生去给下一个人看病
Tell the doctor to go see the next guy.

121
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,910
我就走了
I'm going.

122
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,860
事实上  我不能让你走
Actually, I can't.

123
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,460
有人等着要和你谈话
There's men here waiting to talk to you.

124
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,000
什么样的人
What kind of men?

125
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,200
戴徽章的那种人
The kind with badges.

126
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,470
赛尔夫先生  我是克里斯・弗兰克探员
Mr. self, my name is Agent Chris Franco.

127
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,270
我们是FBI的
We're with the bureau.

128
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,170
我们想问你一些问题
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

129
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,580
什么问题
About what?

130
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,190
告诉我林肯・布伦斯

131
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,110
和迈克斯科菲尔德在哪里
And michaelscofield.

132
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,760
准备好接我们
Be ready to pick us up.

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,230
爆炸的时候最好别离它太近
Better not get too close to that thing when it goes off.

134
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,170
你最好别走远
You'd better not get too far.

135
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,780
好吧
All right.

136
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,630
如果迈克有任何举动  就把他两个膝盖都打碎
If michaeltries anything, take out both knees.

137
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,550
我可不想让他死
I don't want him dead

138
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,780
只想让他动不了向我求饶
I just want him immobilized and eager to talk.

139
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,090
布伦斯怎么处理
And what do you want to do with burrows?

140
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,910
锡拉一到手  就把他丢到海里去
Once I get scylla, dump him off the dock.

141
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,660
喂  新闻里说的人
Yeah, one of the guys from the news.

142
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,140
我想我刚刚看见其中一个
I think i just seen him.

143
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,980
有趣的选择
Interesting choice.

144
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,440
我以为你会选择人多的地方
I would have thought you'd picked something a little more

145
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,680
好保护自己
Public for your own protection.

146
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,660
公共场所现在不利于我的安全
Something a little more public isn't safe for me right now.

147
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,200
拜你所赐
Thanks to you.

148
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,870
你一个人来的吗
Did you come alone?

149
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,400
你呢
Did you?

150
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,300
拜托
Come on.

151
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,670
我们至少能有一次不互相欺骗  对不对
We can have at least one honest conversation, can't we?

152
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,490
事实上  我想诚实
Actually, I'd like that.

153
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080

我从未想要让你受伤

我早知道我不会得到那些了
I knew I'd never have any of those things.

159
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,700
但你会拥有权利  不是吗
But you'll have power, won't you?

160
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,500
对  而你会拥有林肯

161
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,130
老实说我觉得你非常不值
Honestly you're getting the short end of the stick.

162
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,640
说到林肯
Speaking of which

163
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,380
我要把他送去医院  他在哪儿

164
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,470
锡拉在哪儿

我要确信他还活着

167

170
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,530
我不想再和你玩了

很好

172

那把锡拉拿出来给我看

如果我把锡拉拿出来  你的手下就会射杀我

174
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,710
那我们平手了
Then I guess we have a standoff.

175
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,170
唯一的区别是
The only thing is

176
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,940
我要的东西不是奄奄一息流血将尽的
what I want isn't gasping for air and losing a pinned of blood

177
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,250

把它给我  迈克
Give it to me, michael.

180
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,200

迈克我们必须要走了

188
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,750
政府帮了你一把
So the government helped you out?

189
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,220
一起经历了这么多
After all we've been through

190
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,000
你知道那听起来有多疯狂吧

这就是我为什么来找你

我们当时受监控  我等着

给马宏做不利证言  但后来案子不了了之

重新关进福克斯河监狱

让你理解我参与的行动

你是在和一个联邦探员讲话!

你知道我效忠国家

作为国土安全局探员  你一定知道

这个城市每一个警察都在追查我的下落

如果一小时内我没看到锡拉

我就让Bagwell尽情玩弄可爱的医生

他是在玩弄别人的性命

那个伙计毁了所有我能获得自由的机会

你真的以为事情结束你就能自由吗

比自由更好  我会有工作

288
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,910
他凭什么相信你
What is he going to trust you  with?

289

将军雇的是职业杀手  不是业余的
The General hiring professional  killers not amateurs,

290
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,140
更不是没文化的强奸犯

管好你的嘴  小美人
You mind your tongue, little lady

事情结束后  你唯一能得到的

是破裂喉咙  和一座无名坟头

其实你活下去的唯一可能就是逃出这里

00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,120
只要你把我交给他
And michael if you get me back to him,

298
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,640
你们就两清了
the slate could be wiped  clean.

299
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,310
迈克和我是绝对不可能两清的
With michael and me, that slate's never going to be clean.

300
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,250
如果他不把东西给将军

301
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,700
这里会变得无比肮脏的

我要确认林肯还活着
I need to make sure lincoln's okay.

304
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,470
我想那个小炸弹是要炸我的
I suppose that little explosion was meant for me.

305
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,670
就当做是炸警察的吧
Let's pretend it was for the cops.

306
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,170
拜托  迈克
Please, michael.

307
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,510
闭嘴  你真让自己丢脸
Stop, you're embarrassing yourself.

308
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,230
你现在应该知道姜还是老的辣吧
You should know by now that you can't outthink me.

309
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,090
我总会比你多考虑一步
I'll always be one stepped ahead of you

310
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,940
因为我是你妈
because I'm your mother.

311
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,470
林肯还好吗
Is lincoln okay?

312
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,580
我记得我第一次抓住你撒谎时
I remember the first time I caught you in a lie.

313
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,300
我就能从你眼睛里看出来
I could see it in your eyes just

314
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,980
就像今天这样
Like I could see it today.

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,930
让他听电话
Put him on the phone.

316
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,870
你可没资格提要求  儿子
You're not in a position to be making demands, son.

317
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,140
事实上  如果林肯死了
Actually if lincoln is dead, i

318
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,580
我没理由给你锡拉
Have no reason to give you

319
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,240
所以我有这个资格
Scylla which puts me in the position you describe.

320
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,840
知道你还活着真好
It's nice to know you're still breathing.

321
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,700
我还有多少时间
How much time do I have?

322
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,870
不多
Not much.

323
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,920
将军挟持了莎拉
The General has sara.

324
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,910
他给我一小时  用锡拉换她
He's giving me an hour to exchange her for Scylla.

325
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,270
我要知道你们在哪
I need to know where you are.

326
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,790
你能随便给我个有用的信息吗
So if you can give me any kind of signal?

327
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,750
我不知道
I don't know.

328
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,110
如果我要救你们俩
Look, if I'm going to save you both

329
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,800
-我需要信息  任何信息  -又是巴纳吉
- I need something. Anything  -banerjee again.

330
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,150
没多少时间了 迈克
There's not enough time, michael.

331
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,190
我能做到的  林肯
I can do this, lincoln.

332
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,680
我能行的
I can do this.

333
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,430
有件事你得知道
There's something you need to know.

334
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,950
莎拉 怀孕了
sara's...sara's pregnant.

335
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,530
你要做爸爸了
You're going to be a dad.

336
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,600
去救她吧  迈克
Go to her, michael.

337
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,910
我会有办法的  林肯
I'll find a way, lincoln.

338
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,740
时间不够了
There's not enough time.

339
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,890
时间不够了  你
There's not enough time. You...

340
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,420
让我死吧  让我为你做点什么
Let me go out knowing that I did something for you.

341
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,000
给我电话
Give me that.

342
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,120
林肯
lincoln?

343
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
不管林肯会怎样  我感到很遗憾
I'm sorry about what's ever happening to lincoln.

344
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,850
我知道你必须保护家庭
And I know you have to protect your family.

345
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,480
我理解
I understand that.

346
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,110
迈克 那我们这些剩下的人呢
But, michael, what are we going to do about the rest of us?

347
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,010
我老婆怎么办
What are we gonna to do about my wife?

348
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,270
阿历克斯
Alex,

349
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,340
我  我不知道你希望我说什么
I don't...I don't know what you want me to say.

350
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,200
你从来不会没有计划
You haven't gone a day in your life without a plan.

351
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,000
别从现在开始
Please don't start now.

352
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,210
我只知道我还有43分钟把这个给将军
All I know is I have 43 minutes to get this to the General.

353
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,270
我不再做计划了
I am done making plans.

354
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,840
其他人都去死吧
And to hell with everybody else.

355
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,250
也许我该学学你了  阿历克斯
Well, maybe it's time I take a page from your book, Alex.

356
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,150
在外场晃悠
Hang out on the sidelines,

357
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,050
观察场地
Survey the field.

358
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,730
当时机来临  再搭上胜利之马
When the time is right, back the winning horse.

359
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,610
我在你眼里是这样的吗
That's what you think I'm about?

360
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,290
跟我说说  阿历克斯
Tell me something, Alex.

361
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,500
你现在在哪匹马上
Which horse are you backing now?

362
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,930
对这问题  我不是很清楚
Because I'm not quite clear on that.

363
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,350
至少你还有得选
At least you got a decision.

364
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,000
他们杀了我儿子
They took my son.

365
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,490
我没得选
I didn't get to choose.

366
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,320
我只是尽全力不失去一切
I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to not lose everything.

367
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,310
我也是
So am I.

368
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,370
如果你能保护帕姆
So if there's something you need to do to protect Pam,

369
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,440
就尽全力吧
you should do it.

370
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,030
你知道在你耍了小花招之后
Do you realize after what you pulled,

371
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,410
对我已经毫无价值了
You're completely worthless to me now?

372
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,700
你这一辈子都毫无用处
You've been worthless to me all your life.

373
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,750
我知道你和迈克认为我是个可怕的母亲
I know you and michaelthink I was a terrible mother.

374
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,180
我完全赞成
I couldn't agree with you more.

375
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,000
我警告过奥尔多
I warned Aldo.

376
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,520
我告诉过他我不是这块料
I told him I was not cut out for it.

377
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,770
不是我的天性
It is not in my nature.

378
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,950
他以前叫我  他的麦克白女士
He used to call me his lady Macbeth.

379
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,030
我就知道我讨厌莎士比亚是有原因的
I knew there was a reason I hated shakespeare.

380
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,880
你讨厌是因为你不能理解
You hated it because you couldn't understand it.

381
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,750
你不能理解是因为
And you couldn't understand it

382
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,120
你的亲生母亲和隔夜的甜甜圈一样蠢
Because your real mother was as dumb as a day-old doughnut.

383
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,890
你问我
You asked me

384
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,400
我怎么就坐看着我儿子去上电椅
how I could just sit and watch my son go into the chair.

385
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,930
答案很简单
The answer's simple really.

386
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,390
你不是我儿子
You're not my son.

387
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,050
迈克已经知道了
michaelalready knows.

388
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,980
肯定是因为这个  他才轻易放弃了你
That must be why it's so easy for him to p  lay with your life.

389
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,910
我想我们是有共同点的
I guess we have that in common.

390
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,200
现在去找我儿子
Now, go find my son.

391
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,600
你的资料会让你被捕
Your information leads to an

392
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,590
我们会保证法庭不会对你动手
Arrest, we'll make sure the courts can't touch you.

393
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,670
你能立字为据吗  然后再做事
Can you put that in writing? And then we'll do business.

394
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,650
不不  你唯一能要求写下的
No, no. The only thing you get to demand in writing

395
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,630
是你的墓志铭
is what we will put on your tomb stone.

396
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,940
你们最不想发生的
The last thing you are gonna want to

397
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,980
就是发现那兄弟俩在外杀人
Find out about is the brothers is killing somebody else,

398
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,960
而你们却在这刁难唯一的线人
While you are in here harassing your only source of intel

399
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,740
那个必须写下来  并由司法部长签字
It's need to be in writing, and signed by the attorney General.

400
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,350
我不相信任何自称为政府工作的人
I don't trust anyone who says they work for the government.

401
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,310
你要做的就是给兄弟俩打电话
All you have to do is call the brothers.

402
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,350
让他们听电话  我来讲
Get them on the phone and let me talk to them.

403
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,700
让他们自己决定  好吗
Then they can make up their own minds, all right?

404
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,400
我不想再搅和这事了
I'm just trying to stay out of all this.

405
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,450
我好不容易家庭团聚
I finally got my family back

406
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,790
不想再次冒险失去他们
And not about so risk losing them again.

407
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,040
我知道现在很幸福
I know this feels good today

408
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,610
那几个月后呢
But what about a couple months from now

409
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,290
你能找的工作都是黑工
When the only job you can get is under the table or

410
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,040
或者贩人蛇  每时每刻
Some labour gill or every minute you will be worrying if

411
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,990
总是担心旁边的人会大声报警
The guy next to you is going to drop the dime in a hard beep

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,300
因为他认出你了
because he recognizes you.

413
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,970
找到林肯和迈克又能怎样呢
How is finding lincoln and michaelare changing any of that?

414
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,310
这个人帮我搞定了啊
This guy sought me out, okay?

415
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,730
他了解整件事
He knows everything about the whole thing.

416
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,820
他是谁  是政府的人吗
Who is he? Is he government?

417
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,050
如果他是政府的人  我可不想
'Cause if he's government, I don't wanna...

418
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,220
我开始也不相信他
I didn't trust him first either, okay?

419
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,620
但纸上的东西让我改变想法
But something about being in the pen.

420
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,760
你可以辨认谁是玩家  谁是阿飞
You start to decipher who is a player and who is a punk.

421
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,270
这个人和斯科菲尔德一样  是玩家
And this guy is a player, just like scofield.

422
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,510
现在要做的就是
So the only thing we have to do

423
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,590
告诉他兄弟俩在哪
is tell him where the brothers are,

424
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,890
把那装置还回去  该给谁给谁
Get this device thing back in and so he can put it into the right hands.

425
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,730
然后呢
Then what?

426
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,100
这哥们很牛的
This brother has juice.

427
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,340
他可以抹掉我们所有的记录
He can erase our entire record.

428
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,150
我不是说钱或者浮华的东西
I'm not talking about cash and all that flashy stuff.

429
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,460
是说直接就自由了
I'm talking about straight up freedom.

430
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,570
像正常人一样  听懂没
Living like a man, you feel me?

431
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,960
当然不  南多
No, of course, Nandu.

432
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,790
是是
Yes, yes.

433
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,330
只是出现了一点技术问题
We just ran into a few technical difficulties.

434
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,930
我理解
I understand.

435
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
如果你多给我们一点点时间  我就
If you give us a little more Time, then I --

436
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,590
不不  别
no, no, don't.

437
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,400
拜托了  不要登机
Please don't get on the plane.

438
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,280
不  我可以
No, I can...

439
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,090
不
No.

440
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,990
你刚让我损失了7.5亿美元啊
You just cost me 3/4 of a billion dollars.

441
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,390
很好

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,610
至少今天不是完全浪费了
At least the day wasn't a total waste.

443
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,290
我本打算等找到迈克
I was going to wait until I found michael

444
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,670
在他面前杀了你
And just kill you in front of him.

445
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,970
但我准备让你一个人
But instead I'm going to take you out

446
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,290
怎么来的怎么走
the same way you came in, alone.

447
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,040
你最好已经拿到锡拉了
you better be calling me to tell me you've got scylla.

448
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,810
你现在派谁来都太晚了
Whoever you've sent after it is too late.

449
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,840
迈克正要把锡拉去和将军换莎拉
michael's giving scylla back to the general in exchange for sara's life.

450
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,490
你他妈是谁?
Who the hell is this?

451
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,480
阿历克斯・马宏 我们还没见过面
alex mahone. I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting.

452
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,350
哦 阿历克斯・马宏
