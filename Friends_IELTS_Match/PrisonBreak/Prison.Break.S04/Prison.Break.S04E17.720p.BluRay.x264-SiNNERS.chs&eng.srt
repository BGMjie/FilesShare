我以为我们是和这些人合作

00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,220
我也是这么想的

根据你现在的表现

很高兴你能这么说
Well, that's good to hear,

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,580
因为竞争者正是你的弟弟迈克尔

迈克尔是你救的

但是别担心

我们已经在亚利桑那找到他的线索

鄂伦先生在他车里等你

告诉他  好好地躲起来

65
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,810
如果我们的人发现了他

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,450
格杀勿论
They've been given a green light.

还要走2500英里

如果我们换班开车 明天晚上就能到
If we take turns sleeping We can be there by tomorrow night.

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,380
要不要给林肯打电话  告诉他我们要去
Should we call lincoln? let him know we're coming?

70
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,940
迈克尔  他是为了救你 才和公司做交易
Michael, he took the company's deal To save your life.

71
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,210
如果我是他  我也会这么做

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,620
你们都错了
Then you'd be wrong, too.

73
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,610
我们要开挺长时间的车
You know, this promises to be a really, really long ride.

74
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,410
我们还是
So, how about we just...

他如果敢动我孩子...

唐  说实话
You know, don,

81
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,680
你貌似对这件事反应不大
You seem to be taking this whole thing pretty well.

82
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,380
我是个很冷静的人
Yeah, well, i'm a pretty calm guy.

83
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,610
我的意思是
All i'm saying is,

84
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,340
我妈妈  他儿子  还有他老婆
My mama, his son, his wife.

86
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,580
这和你们没关系
That's 'cause it's none of your business.

87
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,610

每把钥匙都植入了一个电脑芯片

林肯  你必须听我解释
Look, i need you to hear me out on this, linc.

139
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,580
你把所有计划都给毁了
Everything was all set up and you blew it.

140
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,710
你就是不想让我来处理  对吗
You couldn't just let me handle this, could you?

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,110
如果你说的是把"锡拉"给将军
If by "handle," you mean give scylla back to the general,

142
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,880
你说对了
Then no, i couldn't.

143
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,840
这件事情很复杂
It's more complicated than that.

144
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,140
其实不是
Actually, it's not.

这是我们唯一的一条出路
And this is the only way we can do that!

148
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,840
我不同意你的想法
I don't believe that's true.

149
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,340
说句心里话 你能不能成熟点
You know what, man? You need to grow up.

150
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,110
如果你真是这么想的
Look, if that's how you really feel, linc,

151
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,210
我警告你  我会用尽一切方法 阻止你
I should warn you i'm going to do everything in my power To stop you.

152
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,540
我和将军已经有了协议
I had a deal with the general.

153
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,240
你却给搞砸了
You blew it.

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,580
一旦他发现你  就会杀了你
He finds you, he's gonna kill you.

155
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,440
我早就知道
Surprise, surprise.

156
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,610
我是为了我们才这么做的
I did this for us, michael.

157
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,140
你  我  莎拉
You, me, sara,

158
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,610
还有Lj  这样你才能和莎拉在一起
Lj, so you could be with sara.

159
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,780
你好好为你的家人想想
Two seconds, just think of your family.

160
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,080
我这几天能考虑的
Feels like family's the only thing

161
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,280
只有我的家人了
I can think about these days.

162
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,910
你什么意思
What does that mean?

163
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,550
迈克尔
Michael?

164
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,120
林肯  妈妈还活着
Linc, mom is alive.

165
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,880
什么
What?

166
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,310
到了迈阿密再说
Guess i'll see you in miami.

167
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,790
我们要赶快离开这里
We gotta get out of here.

168
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,280
先生  介意我问你去哪里吗
Sir, you mind if i ask where you're going?

169
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,440
达拉斯

170
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,010
我们能搭个车吗
Mind if we hitch a ride?

171

我有100块油钱
I got 100 bucks; gas money.

172
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,780
求你了
Please?

173
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,620
先生
Sir?

174
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,010
驾驶室不够三个人坐
Cab's not big enough for the two of you.

175
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,140
如果你们想一起搭车
If you want to ride together

176
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,550
你们就得坐货柜里
You're going to have to ride back here.

177
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,190
成交
Done.

178
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,640
坐舒服了

179
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,720
下次停车  要等八个小时
Gonna be eight hours till we stop again.

180
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,840
林肯
Linc...

181
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,410
如果"锡拉"在这里  警卫会有很多
If scylla really is in there, there's gonna be security.

182
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,250
你要集中精神
I need you focused.

183
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,990
好
Yeah.

184
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,640
楼上安全
All Clear upstairs.

185
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,540
你发现什么了
You find something?

186
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,480
我妈的照片
Picture of my mom.

187
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,650
有人知道我一定会来
Someone must have known i was coming.

188
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,910
肯定是和卡鲁斯联系密切的人
Someone who's connected enough to be working with carruth

189
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,310
而且是非常了解你
And who knows you well enough

190
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,410
才可能拿到那张照片
To get their hands on that picture.

191
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,180
只有一个人 符合刚才说的标准
There's only one person i can think of That fits that description.

192
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,880
你的意思是我妈妈在迈阿密
You're saying my mom's in miami?

193
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,280
如果她在其他地方指挥
If she was operating out of this house,

194
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,780
资金对她来说一定不是问题
She certainly had access to money.

195
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,780
她是公司的特工
She's a company agent.

196
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,880
格雷琴说过  她认为 是公司内部人干的
Gretchen said she thought That this could be an inside job.

197
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,540
林肯
Linc...

198
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,550
你妈妈有可能控制着"锡拉"
Your mother could have scylla.

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,940
以前  我们放学的时候 她会烤饼干给我们
She used to bake cookies when we'd come home From school,

200
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,170
在后院和我们一起踢球
Play kickball with us in the backyard.

201
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,320
她不可能是特工
There's just no way that woman was a company agent.

202
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,540
你看了她的资料  对吗
You did read her file, didn't you?

203
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,710
我看了医疗报告
I saw medical reports

204
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,340
上面说她和我做过同样的检查
That said she had the same diagnosis i did

205
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,410
公司的医生也 给她做了手术
And that company doctors operated On her, too.

206
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,970
我一直在想  之后他们是否也带她
Now i'm wondering if they took her off

207
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,810
去了那座小木屋
To a log cabin in the woods after they were done,

208
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,720
给她介绍一个神经科医生
Introduced her to a friendly shrink.

209
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,870
怎么会有人看着自己的孩子
How else could someone just stand by and watch

210
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,250
像落水狗一样让人追杀
Their own children were hunted down like dogs?

211
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,250
可能她不知道
Maybe she didn't know.

212
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,860
她早就知道
She knew.

213
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,580
可能她没办法处理
Maybe it was over her head.

214
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,260
或者她根本不在乎
Or maybe she didn't care.

215
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,380
我只是很惊讶
Anyway, i'm just surprised

216
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,450
将军等了这么长时间  才告诉我们这个秘密
The general waited so long to drop this bomb on us.

217
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,450
其实  我觉得很合情合理
Actually, i think that part makes sense.

218
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,310
不管是什么原因
I mean, for whatever reason,

219
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,380
你妈妈不想让你们知道她还活着
Your mother didn't want you to know she was alive

220
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,780
否则你们可能早就知道了
Or you would have known years ago.

221
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,810
将军只是保守秘密
The general was just keeping that secret, right?

222
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,050
让她高兴  让她卖命
Keeping her happy, keeping her working.

223
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,710
但是  现在情况不同了
But now the game has changed.

224
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,710
他认为现在可以利用你了
Yeah, now he thinks you might be useful.

225
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,320
就像我妈一样
Just like mom.

226
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,680
毫无疑问  他是我接触过的
Beyond question, he possesses the most gifted mind

227
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,110
最天资聪颖的人
Of any man i've ever encountered.

228
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,420
我尽量不带那么多个人情绪
Well, i'll try not to take that too personally.

229
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,150
他钻孔到你的办公室保险箱
He drilled into your office safe

230
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,010
神不知鬼不觉地复制了你的卡
And copied your card without you even noticing.

231
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,210
回想起来  你当时坐在我旁边吧
As I recall, you were sitting right next to me.

232
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,580
如果我们能招纳迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
If we could have turned Michael Scofield,

233
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,590
就能多利用克里斯汀娜30年
It would have been like having 30 more years of Christina.

234
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,760
靠边停下
Pull over.

235
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,450
我的车在那
That's my ride.

236
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,050
怎么了
What's going on?

237
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,260
再见  乔纳森
Good-bye, Jonathan.

238
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,580
不是这里
This isn't the place.

239
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,780
我用假手都能开那种锁
I could pick that lock with my stump.

240
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,980
不  不
No, n-no, n-no.

241
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,380
这就叫表里不一
Remember what they say about books and their covers.

242
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,180
海瑞・温斯顿把希望之星
When Harry Winston donated the hope diamond

243
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,550
捐给史密森尼博物馆时  你知道他怎么
To the smithsonian, you know how he got it from new york

244
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
把它从纽约带到华盛顿吗
To dc?

245
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,310
挂号信
Registered mail.

246
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,010
这是最安全的方式
It's the safest way to go.

247
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,810
毕竟  没人会去邮局
After all, who is going to be looking

248
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,010
查找希望之星
For the hope diamond at the post office, right?

249
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,380
又有谁会到小哈瓦那
And who would be looking for scylla

250
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,980
的一个破烂教堂
At some run-down storefront church

251
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,310
-找"锡拉"呢  -就算你说得对
- In little havana?- All right, let's say you're right.

252
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,210
他们把"锡拉"放里面了
They got scylla back there somewhere.

253
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,810
你进去跟臭保安拼命
You walk in there, reeking that cop stink,

254
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,110
坚持不了多久
You won't last a second.

255
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,980
说得对
That's a good point.

256
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,760
所以由你去
That's why you're going in.

257
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,310
能帮您什么吗
May i help you?

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,080
是的  事实上
Yes, as a matter of fact.

259
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,050
我是查尔斯・帕特西
I'm Charles Patoshik.

260

我正在研究不同种类的
I'm doing some various research on various different kinds

263
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,050
加勒比宗教
Of, uh, uh, uh, caribbean religions, and, uh...

264
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,310
或许可以
Perhaps you could start

265
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,290
从里面开始
Back there where you, you do your, uh, services.

266
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,180
那是我们的圣堂
That is our sanctuary.

267
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,650
只有纯洁的心灵 方可进入
Only the pure of soul May venture inside.

268
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,650
了解
I know.

269
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,080
我去过很多圣堂
I-i have been in many such rooms.

270
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,690
让我看看你的手
Let me see your hand.

271
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,410
你心灵不纯
Your soul is black,

272
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,010
沾有无辜人的鲜血
Stained with the blood of the innocent.

273
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,850
我不能让你进去
I cannot let you pass.

274
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,790
从来没有人这么冒犯过我
I have never been so offended in my life.

275
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,480
我建议  你去别处
I suggest that you continue your research

276
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,790
继续研究
Elsewhere.

277
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,050
如果是不小心
If you drop something

278
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,780
落下的东西
By accident,

279
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,160
上面肯定会有指纹
You leave a fingerprint on it.

280
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,880
她就想让你发现这个
She wanted you to find this.

281
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,780
-为什么  -你以前看过吗
Why? you ever seen it before?

282
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,610
没有
No.

283
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,610
你还记得
Do you remember

284
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,810
那天的事吗
Anything about that day?

285
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,290
我当时4岁
I was four years old.

286
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,250
记得在哪拍的吗
Any idea where it was taken?

287
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,260
忘了
No.

288
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,250
没事吧
You okay?

289
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,350
-如果我发现我妈妈  -听着
I mean, if i found out my mom was... listen,

290
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,080
就我而言  她不是我妈
As far as i'm concerned, she's not my mom.

291
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,450
只是我自由路上的绊脚石
She's just someone in the way of my freedom.

292
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,820
懂了吗
All right?

293
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,510
我6岁生日时
So, on my sixth birthday,

294
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,550
爸爸已经离开很长时间了
Um, my father was long gone by then,

295
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,850
只剩下我  妈妈   林肯
So it was just me, mom, and linc, and...

296
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,510
妈妈送给我礼物
Mom hands me my present--

297
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,550
我唯一的礼物  我以为...
My, uh, my only present-- and i just know...

298
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,180
我猜那是千年隼号的模型
I just know it's the millennium falcon.

299
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,850
有战斗警报声的吗
With the battle alert sound?

300
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,950
没错
Exactly.

301
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,950
-我有过一样的  -当然
-I totally owned that. -of course you did.

302
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,350
我为这个求了母亲好几个礼拜
Anyway, i had been asking for this thing for weeks,

303
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,510
包装的大小看起来一模一样
And the package is just the right size, and...

304
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,950
我撕下包装
I rip open the wrapping paper

305
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,710
结果却是个鸟巢
And... it's a birdhouse.

306
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,980
不
Oh, no.

307
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,650
其实不算是个鸟巢
Oh, yeah, except it's not even a birdhouse.

308
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,510
是一套鸟巢玩具包
It's actually a birdhouse kit.

309
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,650
真是遗憾
I'm so sorry.

310
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,410
之后两天我都没和她说话
I didn't talk to her for two days after that,

311
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,580
但她最后还是想办法让我开始拼
But when she finally got me to open the thing,

312
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,010
我们坐在一起
We sat there together,

313
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,950
一块一块的拼起来
Put it together piece by piece,

314
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,220
那是我的第一个建筑作品
And it was the first thing i ever built.

315
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,210
我很喜欢它
And i loved it...

316
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,550
她一早就知道我会喜欢上它
And she knew i would.

317
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,910
她比我更加了解我自己
She knew me better than i knew myself.

318
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,850
母亲的天性
That's what moms do.

319
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,550
奇怪的是
Yeah, but the strange thing is...

320
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,410
即使我们有23年没见
Even though i haven't seen her for 23 years,

321
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,480
我仍然能感觉到
There's this part of me

322
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,320
她依然是如此
That feels like maybe she still does.

323
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,480
你的车好像有些超载
Your truck looks a little low to the ground.

324
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,480
介意下车来看看吗
You mind stepping outside?

325
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,580
我刚刚才在20英里外磅重过
I just got weighed 20 miles back.

326
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,420
你是高速公路巡警吗
You highway patrol?

327
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,760
去哪里
Where are you going?

328
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,610
这和你无关
You've got no business in there.

329
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,750
除非你有搜查令
Unless you show me a warrant,

330
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
否则马上滚下来
You get the hell out of there right now.

331
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,420
谢谢
Thank you.

332
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,650
上帝
Goodness.

333
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,680
我有磅重点的票据
I got my weigh station ticket

334
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,350
就在我的车上
Right here on the dash.

335
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,420
给你看看
As soon as you see that...

336
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,420
我刚刚才磅过重的
You'll see i got it right here.

337
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,320
给
Here you go.

338
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,350
我要你跟着我回凤凰城
I need you to follow me back to phoenix.

339
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,910
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

340
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,550
我要去达拉斯卸货
I got to get this load to dallas.

341
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,090
这是你自己选的
Well, that's your choice.

342
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,620
找到他们了
I got 'em.

343
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,210
我们该给你哥哥打电话
I think we need to call your brother.

344
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,980
没信号
No signal.

345
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,640
我们肯定在鸟不生蛋的地方
We must be in the middle of nowhere.

346
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,780
林肯说如果公司抓到你的话
Lincoln said that if the company caught you...

347
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,250
我看到这里有个侧门
I think i saw a side door back here.

348
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,250
为何不走正门
What about the main door?

349
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,510
不可能打开了
You'll never get that open.

350
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,410
肯定从外面锁上了
I'm sure it's latched from the outside.

351
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,940
侧门能开吗
Can you open the side door?

352
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,860
也许
Maybe.

353
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,650
莎拉
Sara.

354
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,060
帮我一下
Help me out.

355
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,120
我们搬不动这个
I don't think we're going to be able to move this.

356
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,840
我们不用搬
Maybe we won't have to.

357
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,780
我有个关于克兰兹将军的坏消息
I have troubling news about general krantz.

358
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,180
他还活着
He's alive.

359
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,080
这不可能
I don't see how that's possible.

360
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,680
但我听说有一架
Yes, well, what i'm hearing is a

361
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,280
从公司洛城总部起飞的
helicopter with

362
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,080
直升飞机在一小时前
From company headquarters in los angeles one hour ago.

363
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,280
抵达郊区峡谷
It landed for two minutes in canyon country

364
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,550
正在返回洛城途中
And now it's back in los angeles.

365
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,880
你找到他的尸体了吗
So you got the corpse?

366
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,910
直升机降落在公司总部
The helicopter landed back at company headquarters.

367
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,150
你知道除掉他对我们努力
You know how important getting rid of him is

368
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,010
达到的目标有多重要
To what we're trying to accomplish.

369
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,310
好吧  我可以搞定
All right, I can still get this done.

370
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,020
时间不够了
Not in our time frame.

371
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,750
好吧  我要速战速决
All right, I'm pulling the plug.

372
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,110
我们要着手处理结果了
We need to start dealing with the consequences.

373
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,850
等会儿  关键的是
Wait, wait, wait. first things first.

374
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,250
他知道我已经背叛了他
He knows that i've betrayed him.

375
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,350
我需要消失
I need to disappear.

376
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,550
直觉真敏锐
I think that's a good instinct.

377
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,610
我在森瓦利有间房子
I have a house in Sun Valley.

378
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,010
我还有个主意
I have another idea.

379
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,760
你介意打开扬声器吗
Do you mind putting me on speaker?

380
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,650
格里夫  你是个勇敢的人

照片里的汽车是佛罗里达的牌照
The car in this picture has Florida plates.

386
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,210
你去那儿度过假吗
Did you ever vacation there?

387
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,910
-没有  -你认不认识
- No.  - Do you know anyone

388
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,180
-从那来拜访的人吗  -不认识
- From Forida who came up to visit?  - No.

389
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,690
他们为什么要在那辆车前拍照
Why did they take this picture in front of that car?

390
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,280
我们没有拍过
We didn't.

391
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,680
照片被修改过了
It's been doctored.

392
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,880
这一点我不能肯定
I'm not sure about that.

393
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,340
光线  影子 都处理地很好
I mean, the lighting, the shadows, All sync up perfectly.

394
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,880
这是78年版的西风
This is a '78 zephyr.

395
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,650
迈克尔76年出生
Michael was born in '76.

396
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,980
你是唯一能想起来的人

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,880
这照片是特意为你修改的
She doctored that for you.

398
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,680
看看她还可能修改了什么
Let's see what else she might've changed.

399
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,640
那辆西风的牌照是什么

M-I-K 4-4-1

马丁路德金大道与411道路交叉口处
Martin Luther King boulevard intersects with route 441

402
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,640

About five miles north of here.

403
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,980
很好
Good.

404
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,980
你们在这里  我们在小哈瓦那
You guys are here. listen, we're a little outmanned

405
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,840
人手不够  你们可以支援我们
Down in Little Havana. we could use some backup.

406
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,780
我们有买家的线索
We got a lead on the buyer.

407
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,920
很好  那我们还等什么
Great, what are we waiting for?

408
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,740
我还是自己干吧
I think I gonna do it myself.

409
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,680
我们应该在一起  团队合作嘛
Come on, let's stay together. we're a team, right?

410
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,710
-我说过我能做到  -经过今早的

411

每个人都是平等的了
Each one of us has an equal stake.

413
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,690
无论谁牵的头  我们都要让他们出局
Whoever started this, we're all going to take them out.

414
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,610
我们认为买家是林肯的母亲
The buyer, we think it's Lincoln's mother.

415
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,040
你说什么
What?

416
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,190
正如我所说  我自己干
Like i said, i'm doing this myself.

417
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,040
林肯
Linc!

418
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,910
如果她有"锡拉"
If she has scylla,

419
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,540
她是不会拱手相让的
She's not just going to hand it over

420
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,380
与将军相比是有过之而无不及
Any more than the general would have.

421
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,580
你也不知道
You don't know that.

422
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,280
我们都认为拿着"锡拉"的人
We always thought whoever had scylla

423
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,640
会像将军那样做事
Would do what the general did.

424
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,040
也许她不会
Maybe she won't.

425
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,140
你当真吗
Are you serious?

426
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,980
你妈是公司特工
Your mother is a company agent?

427
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,410
她曾经是
She was.

428
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,780
她现在可能是个好人了
She might be one of the good guys now.

429
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,140
恕我直言
With all due respect,

430
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,780
我觉得你没有把握
I don't think you're in a place where you can make

431
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,410
断定这点
A clear determination about that.

432
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,540
这个MLK 441可能什么也不是
Listen, this MLK 441 could be nothing.

433
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,610
但在那座教堂里
But at the church,

434
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,120
可能会有"锡拉"
There could be scylla.

435
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,250
如果需要你帮助  我会打电话
If i need you, i'll call.

436
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,290
这应该管用
This should work.

437
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,940
克里斯汀娜
Christina?

438
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,570
你有必要知道在过去24小时中
You need to acknowledge that our chance

439
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,240
我们成功的几率大大降低了
Of success has substantially declined in the last 24 hours.

440
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,940
有人在追查我们
There are people out looking for us.

441
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,140
要开始考虑退路了
We need to start thinking in terms of contingencies.

442
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,940
再等等  就几天
Just a little while longer, only a few more days.

443
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,810
克兰兹将军面对严重威胁时
General Krantz refused to adjust

444
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,470
也拒绝调整
When there were credible threats against him.

445
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,880
所以我们才夺取"锡拉"
That's the reason we have scylla now.

446
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,850
你不会拿我和他相提并论吧
Are you honestly comparing me to him?

447
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,440
我知道在整件事中你给自己的定位
I understand what you think your role is in all of this,

448
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,080
也很感谢你的努力
And I appreciate your efforts.

449
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,540
但如果你觉得
But if you can't tell the difference

450
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,540
我和他一样  你就去找将军
Between he and I, perhaps you need to ask

451
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,320
要回你的职位
The general for your old job back.

452
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,940
瞧
Oh, look.

453
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,720
是他打的  你想接吗
Here he is. would you like to take the call?

454
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,440
乔纳森
Jonathan.

455
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,040
下午好  克里斯汀娜
Good afternoon, Christina.

456
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,410
听到你的声音真高兴
It's good to hear your voice.

457
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,840
我想这意味着你找到"锡拉"了
I assume this means you've retrieved scylla.

458
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,010
还没
Not yet.

459
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,940
真糟糕
Oh, troubling news.

460
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,780
知道它在哪吗
Have any idea where it is?

461
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,410
你在哪  克里斯汀娜
Where are you, Christina?

462
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,310
约翰内斯堡  我还能在哪呢
Johannesburg. where else would I be?

463
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,910
我让附近的部下
I've had some of my contacts

464
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,680
到你家去查看
In your area check on your house.

465
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,140
家里没有人
There's no one home.

466
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,340
当然没有  没找到"锡拉"
Well, of course not. as long as scylla's in play,

467
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,820
那个地址就是假的
That address is blown.

468
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,510
你在哪  克里斯汀娜
Where are you, Christina?

469
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,710
我不喜欢你的语气  乔纳森
I don't like your tone, jonathan.

470
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,910
如果语气不好
Excuse me

471
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,440
请原谅
If I sound a bit abrasive.

472
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,610
但刚刚有人想杀我
But it's been a while since anyone's tried to kill me.

473
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,470
天哪
Oh, my god.

474
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,200
你没事吧  发生什么事了
Are you all right? what happened?

475
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,200
鄂伦
Oren.

476
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,770
鄂伦
"Oren"?

477
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,770
我们找到了他的尸体  他杀
We found his body... executed.

478
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,840
我只能想到他是和别人共事的
I can only assume that he's working with someone.

479
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,740
某个不用承受失败的人
Someone who doesn't tolerate failure.

480
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,010
你到底在哪  克里斯汀娜
Now, where are you, Christina?

481
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,940
你听我说
You listen to me.

482
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,840
如果你想说我和这事有关
If you're implying that I had anything to do with this...

483
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,050
你在哪里
Where are you?

484
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,060
我为公司付出了这么多  我丈夫  孩子
After everything i've given to the compeny. My husband, my children...

485
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,710
我想是时候我们坐下来
I think it's time that we had a sit-down.

486
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,910
-好好谈谈  -我告诉你
- And talk.  - Tell you what.

487
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,470
干嘛不召集你的亲信
Why don't you gether up the brain trust,

488
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,140
你的笨女儿和病态情人
That half-witted daughter and your psychotic mistress?

489
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,010
召集起来想想锡拉的去向
Why don't you get together and figure out where scylla is?

490
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,650
然后再打给我
Then call me.

491
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,850
布伦斯先生
Mr. Burrows.

492
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,580
我能带您去您的座位吗
May I escort you to your table?

493
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,320
你一点都没变
You haven't changed a bit.

494
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,840
很高兴你收到了我的信息
I'm glad you got my message.

495
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,870
我知道这不是最直接的交流方式
I know it wasn't the most straightforward

496
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,340
但我要确定那是你
Mode of communication, but I had to be sure it was you.

497
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,720
至少我知道迈克尔怎么得到的
At least now I know where Michael gets it from.

498
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,070
你肯定有很多问题想问
I'm sure you have many questions.

499
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,010
"锡拉"在哪
Where's scylla?

500
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,140
它很安全
It's safe.

501
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,040
现在我只能说这么多
That's all I can tell you for right now.

502
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,840
那我们就没什么可说的了
Then we've got nothing to talk about.

503
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,610
真的吗
Really?

504
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,410
你来就是为了这个吗
That's the only reason you came here?

505
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,040
对
Yeah.

506
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,870
我一直以为你想知道真相
I really would've thought you wanted to know the truth.

507
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,710
我已经知道了
I know the truth.

508
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,040
你为公司效力
You work for the company.

509
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,310
那群用谋杀案陷害我的家伙
The same people that set me up for murder.

510
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,570
-林肯  -还是那群人
- Lincoln...  - The same people

511
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,610
自从我们从福克斯河监狱越狱之后
That have been trying to kill me and Michael

512
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,350
就一直追杀我和迈克尔
Ever since we escaped Fox River.

513
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,820
你可以随便猜测  但我不是个恶魔
You can think it as much as you want, I'm not a monster.

514
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,440
23年过去了  你连道歉都没有
23 years and not even an apology?

515
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,610
如果道歉可以管用的话
If I thought an apology would do any good,

516
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,450
我肯定会道歉
I would offer it.

517
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,140
求你了
Please.

518
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,520
请你坐下
Please sit down.

519
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,270
抛弃你们兄弟俩
Leaving you two boys...

520
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,840
是我这辈子最艰难的决定
Was the hardest thing I ever did.

521
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,870
你还是做了
But you did.

522
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,490
你一走了之去为公司效力
And then you went off and worked for the company.

523
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,180
你以为你了解那个公司
You know, you think you know what the company is,

524
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,250
实际上你根本不了解
But you don't.

525
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,510
公司的意志是受首脑控制的
It is a body that bends to the will of its head.

526
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,310
它现在既好战又嗜血
And right now, it is bloodthirsty and war-hungry,

527
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,360
因为克兰兹将军就是这种人
Because that's who General Krantz is.

528
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,980
但如果一个女人
But what if a woman,

529
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,710
一位母亲掌管公司
A mother, ran it?

530
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,180
你能想象会有多大的改变吗
Can you imagine the different that would make?

531
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,610
你以为你是位母亲
You think you're a mother?

532
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,550
母亲的首要职责 是照顾家庭
A mother's priority Is her family.

533
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,880
如果我把"锡拉"给将军  他就会
If I give scylla back to the general, he leaves me

534
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,750
放过我和迈克尔  我就可以多花些时间
And Michael alone, and I get to spend time

535
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,620
安安静静地陪我儿子
With my son in peace.

536
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,480
要向你解释我为什么这么做  做了什么
Look, I could sit here for days and try to explain to you

537
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,610
可能花上几天时间
Why I did what I did.

538
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,810
简单地说  我就不能保护你了
Suffice it to say, I couldn't protect you then,

539
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,160
但是现在请让我保护你
But let me protect you now.

540
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,140
如果克兰兹将军死了
What if general Krantz were no longer in the picture?

541
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,540
一旦解决了他
Once he is dealt with,

542
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,970
就没有人再追杀你们了
No one would come after you.

543
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,840
但是我需要时间  林肯
But I need time, Lincoln.

544
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,210
我需要两天时间
I need two days

545
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,770
去把一切安排妥当
To put everything into place.

546
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,980
如果你能给我两天时间
If you give me two days...

547
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,470
我就能让你和迈克尔
...then I can give you and Michael

548
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,720
拥有充分彻底的自由
Your complete and utter freedom.

549
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,750
好吧
All right.

550
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,070
好吧
All right.

551
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,570
我现在就开始动手
I'm going to get started right away.

552
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,640
如果克兰兹产生怀疑的话
But if Krantz suspects any of this,

553
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,740
他不会放过我们俩的
He's going to hunt us both down.

554
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,640
正因如此
And for that reason,

555
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,170
在一切办完之前
I can't risk being seen with you

556
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,350
不能让人发现你我见面了
Until all of this is over.

557
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,040
那我怎么联系你
How will I get in touch with you?

558
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,810
你不能联系我
You can't.

559
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,820
对不起
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,970
只要把这个箱子拉倒
Once we pull this box down,

561
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,170
就能压倒售水机
It'll push the water machine

562
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,610
撞开侧门
Right through the side door.

563
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,410
车子减速了  我们肯定下了高速公路
We're slowing down. I think we're getting off the highway.

564
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,480
快弄好了
I'm almost ready.

565
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,850
莎拉  抓住那边的带子
Sara, grab that strap over there.

566
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,380
好的  抓住
All right, hold it.

567
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,950
快点
Come on!

568
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,720
你没事吧
You all right?

569
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,510
你解决那个区域之后
After you clear the area

570
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,870
我就不会遇到任何阻碍了
I don't anticipate any problems.

571
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,870
懂了吗
All right?

572
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,010
放手一搏了
Scylla or not here we come.

573
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,450
好的  等等
All right. hold on.

574
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,110
这些人要干什么
What the hell are those guys doing?

575
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,270
我们无法对付更多人
We're not going against any additional people in there.

576
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,110
-等他们出来  -好的
- We wait until they come back out.  - All right.

577
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,220
林肯的妈妈真的是买家吗
So Lincoln's mother is really the buyer?

578
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,950
看来是的
It appears that way.

579
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,210
我希望他能理解
I hope he understands,

580
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,210
如果需要除掉她才能拿到锡拉
That if I need to take her out to get to scylla,

581
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,210
我会毫不犹豫地杀了她
I'm not going to hesitate to kill her.

582
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,710
同意
No question.

583
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,680
希望不要走到这步
Well, let's just hope it doesn't come to that.

584
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,910
你说真的吗
You serious?

585
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,780
我认真的  如果不用杀掉林肯的妈妈
Yeah. am I serious if we can get scylla

586
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,950
就能拿到锡拉的话
Without killing Linc's mother,

587
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,750
这样更好
That's the preferable outcome.

588
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,050
等等
Wait a second.

589
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,850
如果我要和你一起深入虎穴
If I'm gonna be in the foxhole with you,

590
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,260
我要知道你真的能帮我
I need to know that you have my back.

591
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,910
东西在布伦斯夫人手里
Mrs. Burrows has the item,

592
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,350
拿到它的唯一方法就是杀了她
And the only way to get it is to kill her.

593
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,760
你打算怎么做
What is your move?

594
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,390
我会开枪
I pull the trigger.

595
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,160
他们走了  咱们走吧
There they go, Come on.

596
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,150
唐・赛尔夫
Don self,

597
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,610
国土安全局的
Homeland Security.

598
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,980
我们正在调查 一起虐待动物的案件
We're investigating A cruelty to animal charge.

599
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,810
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're referring to.

600
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,150
在祭祀典礼上大量屠杀鸡群
We're referring to ritual Slaughters of chickens.

601
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,810
你们国家可能允许
Okay, that might be allowed where you come from

602
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,250
但在美国  不允许
But here in America, that's no mas.

603
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,910
鸡吗  太可笑了
Chickens? This is preposterous.

604
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,510
就因为我是加勒比人
This is because I'm Caribbean.

605
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,510
我发誓  我闻到鸡血腥味了
I swear to god, I smelled chicken blood.

606
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,950
比我们封锁的那条街 味道还重
Worse than the place Down the street we shut down.

607
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,480
你想把事情搞大吗
You want to turn this into something?

608
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,110
坐下
Sit down.

609
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,150
如果这没什么鸡 那就是没有
If there aren't any chickens, There aren't any chickens.

610
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,450
但我们必须搜一下 才能知道
But we're not going to know that Until we take a look around.

611
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,250
气味从后面发出来
The smell was coming from back there.

612
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,150
那是我们的圣堂
That is our sanctuary.

613
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,410
我不能让你进去玷污它
I cannot let you to disrupt it.

614
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,480
我理解  但我还是要进去
I understand your concerns, but I need to go back there.

615
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,250
不行  你不能这么做
I insist, you cannot do that.

616
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,350
你可以一起过去  只能做到这了
Best I can do is have you accompany us, please.

617
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,760
走吧

- Just hear me out. - I'm telling you. I think she's lying.

这是从教堂拿来的  某种凭证之类的

那里还有一些自动武器

你认为这只是巧合吗  拜托
You think that's just a coincidence? come on,

680

林卡  你犯不着惊讶

681

一个抛家弃子的女人 现在也会撒谎

685

如果她想领导公司

686
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,010
我们必须有比单枪匹马
There has to a more realistic plan than a one-man

687
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,080
更现实的计划
Frontal assault.

688
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,110
她会听我的
She'll listen to me.

689
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,610
她叫你不要回去了  林肯
She asked you not to come back, Linc.
