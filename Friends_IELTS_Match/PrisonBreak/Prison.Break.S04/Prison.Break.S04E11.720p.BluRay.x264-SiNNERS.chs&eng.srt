00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,460
-什么时候  -明天
- When? - Tomorrow.

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,530
我搞砸了
I messed up.

6
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,960
-什么意思  -我提到了惠斯勒
What do you mean? I mentioned Whistler.

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,000
喂
Hello?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,300
你就是冯
So you're Feng.

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,270
-你是Susan  -没错
Susan. That's right.

10
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,430
墙体用钢纤维强化过
The wall itself is fortified with steel fiber.

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,430
坏消息是  里面有重量
The bad news is that there are both weight

12
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,100
和扩音传感器
and microphonic sensors

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,170
一旦有任何超过
that will alert Company security

14
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,270
2磅的活人出现
to the presence of any breathing human being

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,930
就会拉响"公司"的安全警报
that weighs more than two pounds.

16
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,570
迈克
Mike.

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,900
你长了个下丘脑错构瘤
You have a hypothalamus hamartoma,

18
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,630
医生认为你得动手术
and the doctor feels  that you need surgery.

19
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,800
-再等两天  -不  明天就得做
Two days. No, tomorrow.

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,300
否则你会死的  别无选择
Otherwise, you could die, and there's no alternative.

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,900
再钻进一点点
Just a little bit more.

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,270
慢点
Go slow.

23
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,570
不  他绝对不值得我这么做
No, there's no way he deserves any of this.

24
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,030
随你说吧  美女
Sing it, sister.

25
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,130
他让我吃了那么多苦
After what he put me through?

26
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,930
我自己也不敢相信
I can hardly believe it myself.

27
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,430
我们必须要做的是
Look, what we must do is

28
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,030
你好好色诱一下他
make sure that cosmic justice rains down upon him,

29
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,870
一旦我们拿到将军的卡
for once we obtain the good general's card,

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,970
我们就可以轻松拿到
there ain't hardly nothing standing

31
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,470
冯给我们的
in between us and Mr. Feng's

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,230
1.25亿
$125 million.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,230
我生在大山边  [好大的胸]
I was born on a mountainside.

34
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,300
只管拿好照相机吧
Just keep both hands on the camera.

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,770
开始吧
Let's go.

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,330
好极了
That's great.

37
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,370
非常感谢你  马尔登医生
Thank you so much, Dr. Malden.

38
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,270
你可以下午3点去见他
Yeah, he can see you today at 3:00.

39
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,130
-不  -我们必须去
No. We're going.

40
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,570
我们得有始有终
We need to finish what we started.

41
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,570
我们可以去办
We can do this.

42
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,830
我只要一天
I need one more day.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,770
迈克尔  马尔登医生今天就能见你
Michael, Dr. Malden can see you today.

44
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,070
他向我们保证他不会报警
He's given us his word he won't alert the authorities.

45
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,470
如果你不去  你再出事的话
If you put this off and you, you collapse,

46
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,230
到时会是别的医生为你治疗
you're going to be treated by another doctor.

47
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,600
你想碰运气
Do you want to roll the dice

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,300
看其他医生会不会报警吗
that they're not going to call the cops?

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,270
还有好多事情没做
There's still so much to do.

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,430
好吧
All right.

51
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,200
3点
Three o'clock?

52
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,430
我上一次钻墙
Last time I drilled  a hole in the wall,

53
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,370
是在福克斯河监狱  跟迈克尔用打蛋器钻
it was with an eggbeater back in Fox River with Michael.

54
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,130
真不敢相信  一切就快结束了
I just can't believe it's all coming to an end,

55
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,870
但他却不在这里
and he's not here.

56
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,630
他会没事的
He'll be all right.

57
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,470
你怎么知道
How do you know?

58
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,530
我不知道
I don't.

59
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,870
我只想让我们都集中精神
I'm just trying to keep us focused.

60
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,870
他病了
He's sick,

61
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,670
但是我确定
but I guarantee you one thing

62
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,670
他要是进监狱的话
that'll make him worse--

63
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,230
会更糟糕
going back to jail.

64
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,730
如果我们进不去
If we don't get in there.

65
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,300
我们也得进监狱
that's where we're all going.

66
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,230
他会没事的
He's going to be okay.

67
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,500
我也很害怕
I'm scared, too,

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,870
但他现在应该去医院
but a hospital's the best place for him right now.

69
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,230
如果没有想出计划  他是不会去的
He won't go without a plan to complete the job.

70
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,670
阿历克斯和费尔南多应该很快
Well, Alex and Fernando should be back soon

71
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,370
能带录像回来吧
with the video, right?

72
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,730
应该是
Should be, yeah.

73
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,230
那么  我们只需要第六张卡了
So, then, all we need is the sixth card.

74
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,530
格雷琴正在办
Gretchen's working on that.

75
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,930
你觉得我们能相信她吗
You really think we can trust her?

76
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,130
拿那张卡
To get the card?

77
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,600
只能这样
Absolutely.

78
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,630
还有呢
Anything else?

79
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,230
没了
Nope.

80
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,670
八个保安会护送"锡拉"从地下室
Eight guards will accompany Scylla from the basement bunker

81
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,170
移到车库  一辆装甲车会在车库待命
up to the garage, where an armored truck will be waiting.

82
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,770
一辆车不够保险
One truck is not going to be enough security.

83
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,630
所以我调了一队特工开道
That is why I have a full Secret Service escort

84
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,630
去马奇空军基地
to March Air Force Base.

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,630
然后把它装载入一架C-130运输机
There, it will be brought aboard a C-130.

86
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,930
全程需空中支援  直至抵达里弗洛克
We need air support all the way to River Rock.

87
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,570
里夫上校会借三架F-18给我们
Colonel Rififi is lending us three of his F-18s.

88
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,830
你可能觉得难以置信
It may be hard for you to believe,

89
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,730
但我这次确实安排妥当了
but I do have this under control.

90
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,600
你不用担心任何事情
There's nothing for you to worry about.

91
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,770
飞机着陆后  也会采取相同的警戒措施
When the plane lands, the same precautions will be taken.

92
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,770
装甲车
Armored truck

93
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,650
护送到最终地点
to guards to final location.

94
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,100
下午1点  老房间
Our old room.1pm.

95
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,370
很好
That's fine.

96
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,100
你要去哪
Are you going somewhere?

97
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,970
-我有个约会  -今天吗
I have an appointment. Today?

98
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,530
你告诉我不用担心任何事情
You told me there was nothing to worry about.

99
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,830
别告诉我是去见格雷琴
Just tell me it's not Gretchen.

100
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,970
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

101
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,070
这是我的私事
It's a personal matter.

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,770
我不想做讨论
I'm not going to discuss it.

103
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,830
我不相信她
I don't trust her.

104
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,400
也不是一天两天了
That's nothing new.

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,870
我一小时后回来
I'll be back in an hour.

106
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,230
有什么进展
What'd you find out?

107
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,470
你会一直保持清醒状态
You'll be awake the whole time.

108
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,500
届时  你只要做四次局部麻醉
The only anesthetic you're going to need is four minor injections of local--

109
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,470
两次在额头  两次在后脑
two in your forehead and two in the back of your head.

110
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,730
用于做支撑架
And that's for the brace?

111
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,330
对  支撑架
The frame, yeah, and...

112
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,030
安装过程是最不舒服的
attaching that is going to be the most uncomfortable part.

113
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,970
他们会在你颅骨上打四个固定用的钢钉
They're going to have to secure four pins into your skull

114
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,000
会用一个小钻子进行
and they're going to need a small drill to do it.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,900
我们一定要听吗
Do we have to listen to this?

116
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,170
我想听  林肯
I want to hear this, Linc.

117
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,100
然后呢
And then what?

118
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
再做一次CT扫描
Uh, another CT scan.

119
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,270
医生会用
The doctor will use

120
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,570
三维成像来确定
the three-dimensional imagery to pinpoint

121
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,370
肿瘤的准确位置
the exact location of the growth.

122
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,670
确定以后呢
And once you have that?

123
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,330
接着就是伽玛刀治疗了
Then it's the Gamma Knife unit.

124
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,170
他们会给你带个头盔
They'll fit you with a helmet,

125
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,000
他们会确定201个洞
they'll calibrate it so that each of the 201 holes

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,230
都准确对准肿瘤位置  这时
are aimed directly for the tumor, and at that point...

127
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,870
车里还有两个箱子
I've got two more boxes in the car

128
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,400
你们得帮手拿进来
that you guys got to bring in yourself.

129
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,730
行了
All right.

130
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,030
你没事吧
You okay?

131
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,100
-因为上次见你时  -我很好
Because the last time I saw you... Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,930
我只是有点脱水
I was just a little dehydrated.

133
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,500
好极了
All right, good.

134
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,570
这是你要的东西
This is the stuff you requested.

135
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,600
你确定能用这些东西进去
You sure this is gonna get you in?

136
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
我们会考虑怎么进去
Let us worry about getting in.

137
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,630
你还是考虑我们怎么出来吧
You worry about how we're getting out.

138
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,300
我已派人盯着格雷琴和巴格维尔
I got someone keeping an eye on Gretchen and Bagwell.

139
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,470
如果他们耍花招  他们就玩完了
If they try anything, they're getting taken out.

140
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,800
不会有东西阻碍我们得到"锡拉"
Nothing is going to get between us and Scylla.

141
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,370
你确定你没事
You sure you're all right?

142
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,770
没事  只不过
Yeah, it's just, uh,

143
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,970
我们马上要潜入公司总部
you know, we're breaking into Company headquarters,

144
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,430
多少会有点紧张
and, uh, you'll understand why we're all a little on edge.

145
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,870
明白
Understood.

146
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,070
我以前觉得
You know, I was thinking,

147
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,800
你爸找我办这事时
when your father approached me about doing this,

148
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,230
我感觉
I felt like I was, uh,

149
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,100
就像是在抓鬼一样
chasing a ghost or something, but...

150
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,000
但你们做的一切
'cause of the work you guys have done,

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,610
就是今天
today is the day,

152
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,870
我们要彻底打垮这帮混蛋
We're gonna take these bastards down.

153
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,310
到手了吗
You get it?

154
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,780
是的
Got it.

155
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,310
我们还剩4小时
We got four hours.

156
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,610
怎么说
How come?

157
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,410
我要去去医院治疗
I'm going in for treatment.

158
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,910
可以了
Here we go.

159
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,180
"锡拉"
Scylla.

160
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,480
显然  我们有很多事情要解决
Obviously, we've got a lot to figure out.

161
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,210
我们要穿过两面墙
We have to break through two walls.

162
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,610
一面水泥墙  一面玻璃墙
one concrete, one glass

163
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,210
还要保证不发出声音
and do it without making a sound.

164
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,640
高敏感抛物面扩音器
Hypersensitive parabolic microphones,

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,210
全方位扫射
pointed in all directions.

166
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,240
地面传感器能检测
The floor sensors can detect

167
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,710
附着地面两磅以上的物体
an added surface load of just two pounds.

168
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,980
所以
So...

169
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,240
我们要在不触碰地面的情况下
we have to traverse the distance between the two walls

170
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,640
跨过两面墙间的距离
without touching the floor

171
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,280
并且无论如何不能产生任何
and do all that without generating any kind

172
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,640
来自身体的热量
of body heat whatsoever.

173
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,980
因为这些是最先进的热感应器
Cause these are the latest in heat-sensing technology.

174
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,010
我们走错一步
We make one wrong move,

175
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,810
监视器就会启动  克兰兹将军就会发现我们
the camera goes on, and General Krantz will know we're inside.

176
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,240
不可思议
It's amazing.

177
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,410
所有这些安保  只有
All this security and only one man

178
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,840
他一个人能使用监视器
has access to video surveillance.

179
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,240
"公司"不想留下任何下面的记录
The Company doesn't want any record of what's going on down there.

180
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,780
我们能进入那个电梯吗
Can we access that elevator?

181
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,010
不能  电梯在"公司"大楼中间
No, it's right in the middle

182
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,440
那里有10层安保
of the Company building-- there are ten layers

183
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,610
我们要去他们看不到的地方
of security. We have to go where they're not expecting us,

184
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,680
先从水泥墙开始
starting with the concrete wall.

185
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,080
苏克雷  你在那里钻孔  对吧
Sucre, you were drilling there, right?

186
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,940
如你所说  墙体用钢纤维强化过
It's fortified with steel fibers, just like you said.

187
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,180
要穿过那面墙
All right, in order to get

188
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,510
需要生成一个
through that, we have to generate

189
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,410
电磁场
an electromagnetic field...

190
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,640
需要生成一个电磁场
We have to generate an electromagnetic field...

191
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,040
要生成
To have, uh,

192
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,780
符合我们需要强度的
an electromagnetic field

193
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,640
电磁场  我们至少
with the force that we want, we're going to need

194
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,980
需要两个车用电池
at least a couple of car batteries.

195
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,140
你能搞得到吗
Can you get that?

196
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,880
可以
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,880
我们可以办到
We can do this.

198
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,940
预计格雷琴什么时候
Uh, what time are we expecting Gretchen

199
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,880
能搞到第六张卡
to get that sixth card?

200
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,740
怎么这么久才来
What took you so long?

201
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,380
你知道我如饥似渴时会怎样
You know how I get when I'm hungry.

202
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,240
我要离开办公室也不容易
It wasn't easy getting away from the office.

203
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,910
我应该像以前那样
I could have come to you...

204
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,310
自己过去
like old times.

205
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,710
我真希望这里能有张红木桌子
I almost wish there was a mahogany desk in here.

206
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,810
你有点紧张
Oh... you're tense.

207
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,040
把外套脱了吧
Take off this jacket.

208
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,510
我帮你拿进去
Let me get in there.

209
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,040
我没有带过来
I didn't bring it with me.

210
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
我的卡
My card.

211
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,110
你在找这个  对吧
That is what you're looking for, right?

212
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,980
你在说什么呢  你的卡
What are you talking about? Your card.

213
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,280
你忘啦
You forget.

214
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,040
是我教你如何说谎的
I'm the one that taught you how to lie.

215
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,510
我没想到  在63岁的高龄
I never thought that, at the age of 63,

216
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,440
我仍然会心碎
I could still have my heart broken.

217
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,580
什么让你觉的有必要偷我的卡
Why did you feel you needed to steal my card?

218
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,510
你难道没想过稍加等待
Don't you know that if you'd waited just a little bit longer,

219
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,240
你也可以拥有自己的卡
you'd have had one of your own?

220
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,940
对不起
I'm sorry. I'm...

221
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,980
你要把卡卖给谁
Who are you selling it to?

222
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,140
不是的  不是
That's-That's not why...

223
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,880
谁
Who?

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,380
我是你孩子的母亲
I'm the mother of your child.

225
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,540
求你  看在艾米丽的份上
Please, for Emily's sake.

226
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,110
求你了  乔纳森
Please, Jonathan.

227
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,910
求求你
Please.

228
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,140
我爱你
I love you.

229
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,810
再让我看到你
If I ever see you again...

230
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,610
我就杀了你
I'll shoot you on sight.

231
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
有事吗  科尔
Is everything all right, Cole?

232
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,910
我有要事跟你说
I got something important you need to know.

233
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,240
我们要发财了
We're gonna be rich.

234
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,910
有个问题
So, here's the question.

235
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,180
我得花多少钱
How much is it gonna cost me

236
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,040
才能让你把外套脱了
to get that jacket off of you?

237
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
你说什么
Excuse me?

238
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,850
每次见到你
Last day I'm ever gonna see you.

239
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,500
你都裹得很严
You're all covered up.

240
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,980
我可受不了  1百美金如何
I cannot abide. $100.

241
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,310
你想付钱让我脱衣服
You want to pay me to take my clothes off?

242
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,180
不是脱光  只是脱外套
Not all of them. Just the jacket. Mm.

243
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,840
-2百  -我不会为你脱衣服的
$200. I'm not gonna strip for you.

244
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,040
可怜可怜老人家吧
Pity on an old man.

245
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
你真恶心
You're disgusting.

246
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,010
也很淫荡很邪恶
And lecherous and vile.

247
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,240
而且马上就会很有钱
And soon to be wealthy beyond belief.

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,040
1千美金
One thousand dollars.

249
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,010
怎么突然这么纯洁
Why so modest all of a sudden?

250
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,940
科尔  马上来我办公室
Cole, I need to see you in my office now.

251
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,680
感谢您致电伽特  有什么需要吗
Thank you for calling Gate. How can I help you?

252
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,780
怀特先生的顶级销售员来办公室了
It was Mr. White in his office with the lead stapler.

253
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,110
科尔  昨天与爱达荷的交易
Cole, yesterday, with that Idaho group,

254
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,580
你为公司赚了3.5万美元
you made this company $35,000.

255
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,640
我得有所表示
And I would like to return the favor.

256
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,410
这是我们的年度旅游
It's our annual cruise.

257
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,540
七天6夜直达环游
Seven days and six nights of non-stop pitching.

258
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,510
我个人通常报销5万
I personally clear $50,000 on most trips,

259
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,280
但凭你的功劳
but for everything you've done,

260
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,880
这是你应得的
it's all yours.

261
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,340
我的薄礼
The least I could do.

262
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,010
今天就出发吗
It leaves today?

263
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,380
回家去收拾一下
Go home and pack.

264
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,240
一周后见
I'll see you in a week.

265
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,180
不好意思  我有些事务
Unfortunately, I have some business

266
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,610
要在这边处理
I need to take care of right here.

267
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,080
它的工作原理是这样的
Okay, so, here's how it works.

268
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,510
一旦传感器检测到任何
As soon as the sensors pick up any kind of a heat source

269
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,780
90度或更高的热源  系统进入待命状态
90 degrees or more, system goes into standby,

270
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,080
黄灯亮起
a yellow light comes on.

271
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,440
待命五秒后
After five seconds in standby,

272
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,980
如果热源没有消失  警报拉响
if the heat source isn't gone, we have an alarm.

273
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,680
我们只有6秒时间穿过过道
So we got six seconds to make it across the hallway

274
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,910
和玻璃墙
and through the glass wall?

275
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,480
差不多
Basically.

276
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,840
如果带上液态氮
If we get our hands on some liquid nitrogen,

277
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,380
我们可以降低温度
we could regulate the temperature.

278
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,740
没错
Yeah.

279
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,810
一石二鸟
Kill two birds with one stone.

280
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,180
看能否搞到这些东西
See if you can get some of that.

281
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,440
我不会问你感觉如何
I'm not going to ask how you're feeling.

282
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,580
很好
Good.

283
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,710
我进"公司"四年后
About four years after I joined the bureau,

284
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,440
我手下第一个特工
my first special agent in charge.

285
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,980
被诊断患有肝癌
he was diagnosed with liver cancer.

286
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,810
但对他来说
But for him,

287
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,380
最难的不是治疗过程
the hardest part wasn't the treatment.

288
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,210
而是要放下工作
The hardest part was leaving the office,

289
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,810
当时我们正在办一起重大敲诈案
because we had this... we had this big RICO case

290
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,810
就要审判了
that was about to go to trial,

291
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,410
我们录了无数小时
and we're talking thousands

292
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,780
的口供  查了五年
of man hours, five years of research.

293
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,480
但他快要做化疗了
And the guy was going to be in chemo.

294
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:09,010
他很害怕
And he was scared.

295
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,240
他怕我们会输掉案子
He was scared that we were gonna lose the case,

296
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,840
不法之徒则会逃脱法律的制裁
and that a lot of bad men were gonna walk.

297
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,410
我猜  他让一群社会败类
Let me guess: He had a ragtag band of criminals

298
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,580
准备接受惩罚
ready to pick up the slack.

299
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,080
差不多
It was something like that.

300
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,640
我们不会让你失望的  迈克尔
We're not going to let you down, Michael.

301
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,840
你的上司呢
What happened to your boss?

302
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,310
他见证了我们的胜利
Oh, he was there to see us win.

303
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,380
你确定她是特工
You're sure she's a Fed?

304
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,850
我出1千美金  她都不脱上衣
Wouldn't take off her jacket for a thousand dollars.

305
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,410
她肯定收着一把枪
She's got a gun under there.

306
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,650
这就复杂了
It's a complication.

307
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,750
你这么说就对了
Well, that's a nice way to put it.

308
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,650
就像你没拿到第六张卡
Sort of like you not getting the sixth card.

309
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,350
怎么说来着  拖后腿嘛
What are we calling that now, a setback?

310
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,910
放松点
Relax.

311
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,250
你知道我放弃了什么吗
You have any idea what I'm giving up here?

312
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,880
我原本能拿到5万
I was guaranteed 50 grand.

313
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
就为5万哭丧着脸  你不是吧
You're crying over $50,000? Are you serious?

314
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,380
我有一份工作
I have a job.

315
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,050
我能赚钱  别人发邮件给我
I make money. I get mail.

316
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,480
都尊呼我  先生
People call me sir.

317
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,780
每天干12小时  吃着残羹剩饭
12-hour days and eating leftover lo-mein.

318
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,480
直觉告诉我  帝博格・巴格维尔
Something tells me Theodore Bagwell

319
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,110
不会坚持太长时间
wouldn't last long in this situation.

320
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,110
可能
Yeah, maybe,

321
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,250
但是科尔・普发会坚持
but Cole Pfeiffer would.

322
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,910
要生气  也要等明天
You want to pout, you do it tomorrow.

323
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,280
我们有事要办
We have work to do.

324
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,810
真的值1.25亿美金吗
Is it really worth $125 million?

325
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,310
价值是两倍
It's worth twice as much.

326
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,410
如果他们不交货呢
What if they refuse to hand it over?

327
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,150
我们要么付钱  要么杀了他们
Either we pay for Scylla, or we kill for it.

328
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,370
苏珊
Susan?

329
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,610
冯  我们得谈谈
Feng, we need to talk.

330
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,150
给我点时间  就一会
Hey, give me a second here, guys, just a second.

331
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,150
我们不能发出超过两分贝的噪音
We can't make any noise above ten decibels.

332
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,280
你搞了两个这家伙吗
You got two of those?

333
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,150
是的
Absolutely.

334
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,510
能成功的  对吧
This is gonna work, right?

335
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,180
应该会
It should.

336
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,210
不仅如此
No, not just that.

337
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,850
整个计划
The whole thing.

338
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,950
我们有成功的机会吗
I mean, do we even have a chance?

339
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,010
只要确定打洞的位置准确
Just make sure the hole is in the right place.

340
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,650
进展如何
So, where are we?

341
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,650
格雷琴没有拿到第六张卡
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

342
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,110
我们需要那张卡  唐
We need that sixth card, Don.

343
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,780
我知道
I know.

344
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,560
如果没有那张卡
If we don't get the sixth card,

345
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,280
我们永远无法破解"锡拉"
We're never gonna crack Scylla.

346
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,350
我知道
I know it.

347
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,520
我们还知道什么
What else do we know?

348
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,110
我们知道他们今天就转移"锡拉"
Well, we know they're moving Scylla today.

349
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,350
我们也不能明目张胆地进将军的办公室
We know we can't just waltz into the General's office

350
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,510
偷最后一张卡
and steal that last card,

351
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,750
我们该怎么应对
so where does that leave us?

352
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,180
应该有办法
Then there's got to be a way.

353
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,650
-肯定有办法  -除非再牺牲一个人
There has to be a way. Not without losing another man.

354
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,840
相信我  我用一周时间思考
Believe me, I spent the last week trying to figure out

355
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,920
如何得到第六张卡
how to get that sixth card,

356
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,760
但每种方法的结果都是某人头上顶枪
And every scenario ends with a gun to someone's head,

357
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,050
而这是不可接受的
And that is not acceptable.

358
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,480
格雷琴给了一点
You know, Gretchen did pass on this one piece

359
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,110
信息给你
of information for you.

360
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,480
应该对你有帮助
This could be helpful.

361
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,050
喂
Hello.

362
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,310
买家出现了
The buyer just showed up.

363
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,080
好的  查清他们要干什么
All right, well, find out what they're up to.

364
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,350
冯先生  很高兴你能来见我们
Mr. Feng, so glad you could come and see us.

365
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,910
我预料我们三个
I was expecting the next time

366
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,780
会再聚在这个房间里
the three of us would be in the same room together,

367
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,680
你们会拿东西给我
that you'd have something for me.

368
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,310
我们预想也是如此
That was our expectation, as well,

369
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,980
但我们遇到点麻烦
but we've hit a few bumps in the road.

370
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,300
为了确保安全
Now, to ensure the item's safe recovery,

371
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,650
我们需要你帮忙
we need your help.

372
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,750
该走了
It's time to go.

373
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,610
逃跑是最好的办法
"All that avails is flight."

374
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,080
或许我爸爸查到了某些事情
Maybe my father was onto something.

375
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
如果因为我们试图搞垮公司
If they all die

376
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,250
他们都死了
because we tried to take down the Company,

377
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,350
而我还活着
and I survive because...

378
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,810
只是因为我因病离队
because I called in sick...

379
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,080
我自己该如何活下去
...how am I gonna live with myself?

380
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,210
你会好起来的
You're gonna get through this.

381
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,110
我不去医院了
I'm not going to the hospital.

382
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,980
什么
What?

383
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,280
林肯  只管上车吧
Linc, just get in the car.

384
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,650
我和你们一起去
I'm going with you.

385
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
如果我还有行医执照的话
If I still had a medical license,

386
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,310
我肯会因此吊销
I'd lose it over this.

387
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,780
这通常是给癫痫病人用的
This is usually given to epileptics.

388
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,110
它能在接下来的3小时内
It will suppress the rapid firing of neurons

389
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,910
抑制神经元快速发放
for the next three hours,

390
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,410
使病情发作的
making it unlikely

391
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,580
可能性变小
that you'll have a seizure in that time,

392
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,480
不过迈克尔  任何精神上或身体上的压力
but Michael, any added mental or physical stress...

393
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,550
我明白
I get it.

394
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,880
我说真的
I mean it.

395
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,650
不在万不得已的情况下  我希望你别乱动
I don't want you to move unless you absolutely have to.

396
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:55,380
等一切结束后  我就带你去医院
And as soon as this is over, I'm taking you to the hospital.

397
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,450
你还好吗
You all right?

398
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,810
一切都会按计划进行
This is gonna go exactly as planned.

399
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,910
我保证
I promise.

400
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,050
我不是在为自己祈祷
I'm not praying for me.

401
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,510
我们走吧
Let's go.

402
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,250
你要见我
You wanted to see me?

403
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,380
每月的第二个周二
It's the second Tuesday of the month.

404
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,710
你不是要参加飞鹰天使的聚餐吗
Don't you have your Eagles and Angels luncheon?

405
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,050
我今天不去了
I figured I'd skip it today.

406
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,750
你叫我来就为了确认我的午餐计划吗
You called me in here to confirm my lunch plans?

407
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,850
你是对的
You were right.

408
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,750
如果不是你的提醒  这东西就被偷了
If it weren't for you, this would be in the wind.

409
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,410
-她死了吗  -这样说吧
Is she dead? Let's just say

410
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,080
她不会再干扰我们任何人了
she won't bother either of us anymore.

411
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,110
但我还是想马上转移"锡拉"
But I do want Scylla moved right now.

412
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,580
机械师正在停机坪上检查C-130运输机
Our mechanics are on the tarmac inspecting the C-130.

413
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,910
确定无误后  我们就能转移了
When they sign off, we'll be ready to move.

414
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,210
告诉其他持卡者  在这集合
Call the other card holders, get them in here.

415
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,950
赛尔夫给你们打电话了吗
Did, uh, Self call you, uh, regarding

416
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,510
说了将军那边的小动荡吗
a little snafu with the General?

417
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,610
滚开
Get out of my way.

418
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,280
只是澄清一下
Just for, uh, clarification's sake,

419
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,710
第六张卡是待办的一部分  对吧  先生们
the sixth card is part of the to-do list, right, gentlemen?

420
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,110
游戏开始了
The game's afoot.

421
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,650
迈克尔有办法弄到卡吗
Does Michael have a way to get the card?

422
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,110
我和迈克尔・斯科菲尔德交手过
I've worked with Michael Scofield before,

423
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,310
不论是同伙还是敌人
both with him and against him.

424
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,610
如果没有完整的计划
There's no way he's going down there

425
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,910
他是不会动手的
without a plan to finish the job.

426
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,280
我接到一位老友的电话
I got a call from an old friend.

427
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,450
听说"锡拉"有眉目
Heard Scylla was in play.

428
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,180
他想知道他能否弄到手
He wants to know if he can get in on it.

429
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,850
竞购战
A bidding war?

430
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,450
他出价2百
He's prepared to offer 200.

431
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,610
他说真的吗
Is he for real?

432
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,980
我不清楚  我找了间安全的屋子
I don't know. I've set up a safe house

433
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,010
在那可以跟他谈  你有笔吗
where we can hear him out. Do you have a pen?

434
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,310
等一下
Just a minute.

435
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,650
皮尔蒙特街1917号
1917 Piermont.

436
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,250
皮尔蒙特街  记下了
Piermont,got it.

437
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,880
我马上过去
I'm on my way.

438
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,880
下午好
Uh, good afternoon.

439
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,710
感谢您致电伽特公司
Thank you for calling Gate.

440
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,150
我要去跟购买商
I got some last minute negotiations

441
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,980
做最后的协商
with the buyer to speak about.

442
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,310
我马上回来
I'll be back lickety-split.

443
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,580
一会见
See you later.

444
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,210
请稍等
Mm-hmm. Can you hold, please?

445
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,580
好的
All right.

446
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,710
就是这里
This is it.

447
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,610
现在  还有人
Now, does anyone have any questions

448
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,750
对自己要做的部分有疑问吗
about what they're supposed to do?

449
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,010
今早你们在墙上钻的洞
That hole you drilled in the wall this morning.

450
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,210
我们到了那里  如果噪音过大
once we get over there, if we make too much noise,

451
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,180
声波会穿过墙
the sound waves will travel through the wall

452
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,910
被另一侧的传感器检测到
and get picked up by the sensors on the other side.

453
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,910
所以从现在开始  我们要绝对安静
So, from this point on, we need absolute silence.

454
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,280
阿历克斯  祝好运
Alex, good luck.

455
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,950
你也是
You, too.

456
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,610
准备好了吗
You're ready?

457
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,450
走吧
All right.

458
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,110
我们要穿过两面墙
We have to break  through two walls--

459
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,480
一面水泥墙  一面玻璃墙
one concrete, one glass--

460
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,110
还要保证不发出声音
and do it without making a sound.

461
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,150
要穿过那面墙
In order to get through that,

462
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,610
需要生成一个电磁场
we have to generate an electromagnetic field.

463
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,410
要生成
To have

464
