00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,960
如果你们成功得到“锡拉”
If you're successful with obtaining Scylla,

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,460
不仅不用坐牢
you'll not only avoid jail time,

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,630
而且可以因为帮助国家
but you could take great pride in knowing

6
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,000
除去这个巨大的威胁  而得到奖励
you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat to its own democracy.

将会得到体面的葬礼

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,830
格雷琴有其余的图纸
Gretchen has the rest of the pages.

10
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,500
除非她把几页纸给我们  否则就无法前进
We can't go any further until she gives them back.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,930
为什么还要这么做
Why are we doing this again?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,060
这是安全保障
It's an insurance policy.

13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,600
你如果再用枪指着我
You put a gun on me again,

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,330
我就连你的指纹也一起取了
and these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.

15
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,560
迈克

布拉德  快出来

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,130
-使劲推  -别这样做
Push it! Don't do this!

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,160
布拉德
Brad!

22
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,860
如果出现什么状况
If anything should happen,

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,800
给我芝加哥的妈妈打个电话
call my mom in Chicago.

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,460
不会有什么状况发生的
Nothing's going to happen.

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,300
布拉德的尸体在哪
Where's Brad's body now?

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,000
运往停尸房的路上 放在国土安全局的冷柜里
We got it on its way to the morgue, and it's in the cooler

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,760
没有人会发现的
at Homeland Security where nobody can find it.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,030
这不是我们之前说好的
That ain't part of the deal.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,000
你说过如果我们发生意外 我们会被送到家人手里
You said if anything happened to us,that we'd be returned to next of kin.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
这不是我当时说的
That's not exactly what I said.

31
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,260
不  这就是你当时说的
No, that is exactly what you said.

32
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,760
我不是那么说的
No, it isn't exactly what I said, okay?

33
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,400
他现在是一具无名男尸  除非我说他不是
And he needs to stay a John Doe until I say otherwise.

34
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,060
我现在要处理的事情已经很多了
Okay? I'm dealing with enough stuff already

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,330
而且我的处境也不妙
and I've had my ass chewed out...

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,960
他有
He's got...

37
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,430
他还有妈妈  你知道吗
He's got a mother, you know.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,560
如果你还想要"锡拉"
If you want Scylla, and I assume you still do,

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,330
就把布拉德・贝里克的尸体运回给他妈
Brad Bellick's body goes home to his mother.

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,560
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

41
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,460
我去处理尸体的事
All right, I'm gonna take care of the body.

42
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,130
但是你们
But you guys

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,100
不能再伤感下去了
need to get out of mourning.

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,130
我们得马上回到工作上
Okay, we need to get back to work.

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,900
把布拉德的遗物收拾一下
You need to pack Brad's stuff up,

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,930
回到正常的工作上
and we need to get back to work.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,100
还有  费尔南多
And Fernando,

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,330
朋友  我忠告你
my friend, let me tell you something.

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,600
如果你再碰我一下
If you ever put your hands on me again,

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,500
我保证
I promise you, okay,

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,300
我让你一起去陪葬
there's gonna be two bodies in the fridge.

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,500
我需要答案
But I need results.

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,860
我需要缺失的几页纸
Yeah, well, I need to see those missing pages.

54
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,160
你说呢
So, what's it gonna be?

55
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,300
我听说你死了
I heard you were dead.

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,460
谁告诉你的
Who told you that?

57
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,960
一只小鸟
A little bird.

58
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,600
你怎么这么大方
That's awfully generous of you.

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,500
我要算准时机
It's all a matter of timing.

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,030
"公司"要把"锡拉"转移到滨洲的一个地堡里
The Company is moving Scylla to a bunker in Pennsylvania.

61
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,160
-什么时候  -明天
When? Tomorrow.

62
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,400
你在得知后  应该马上给我电话
You want to make sure to mention that on the phone right away, as soon as...?

63
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,660
说实话  作为前雇员
You know, for an ex-employee,

64
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,830
你对公司的现况应该了解很多
you sure seem to know an awful lot about current Company business.

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,130
别这么偏激
Don't get paranoid.

66
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,860
我不正在为你们打探消息嘛
I'm keeping one ear to the ground for your benefit,

67
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,160
所以  你们最好跟我合作  而不是针对我
which is a really good reason to work with me and not against me.

68
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,060
好了  我们拿到图纸了
All right, you know what? We got our pages.

69
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,330
走吧
Let's go.

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,130
那是运输部的安泽

他负责电力传输

72
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,500

And you know Powell.

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,600
他监管安全装置
He's supervising the security override.

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,530
这是个大工程
It's a big job.

75
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,800
也许我们应该找大卫・贝克
Perhaps we should call in David Baker.

76
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,960
确保安全
Just to be safe.

77
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,130
没必要
That won't be necessary.

78
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,260
我们内部的人就可以完成
We can do this all in-house, huh?

79
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,400
"锡拉"明天就不在这了
And Scylla will be gone by morning.

80

需要的话 我帮你打
I'll do it if you want.

82
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,800
没关系  我来打
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

83
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,830
看看这个
Look at this.

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,460
警察慈善会时  他留了个徽章
He kept a badge from the police benefit.

85
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,830
他在福克斯河监狱当狱警时
When he was a CO in Fox River,

86
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,160
他考了5次警官学院  都没有通过测试
he-he failed the test to get into the academy five times.

87
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,000
图是真的吧
These are right, right?

88
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,860
这是"公司"地下室的地图  对吧
This is a map of the Company's basement, right?

89
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,630
我不明白  看起来太简单了
I don't know. It looks too simple.

90
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,700
我以为会更复杂一点
I assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this.

91
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,130
这些符号是
These symbols-- they're...

92
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,700
根本没有意义  还有这些字母
They don't make any sense, and the letters, uh...

93
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,860
肯定有什么地方错了
There's just something wrong.

94
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,630
字母C
This letter C--

95
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
一般表示散热口
it usually designates some kind of heating vent.

96
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,600
M表示计量器
The M designates a meter.

97
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,860
这是某种冷凝装置
This is some sort of condensing unit.

98
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,200
这是管道设备  叫做P型管
This is a plumbing part. It's called a P-trap.

99
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,830
他们是完全不同的东西
They're all completely dissimilar items.

100
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,530
设计逻辑学里  这些
Logical design dictates they'd never

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,830
不能随意安装
be installed that randomly.

102
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,200
根本
It just, um...

103
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,660
一点意义都没有
It doesn't make sense.

104
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,170
C  M  E
C  M  E

105
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,360
C

106
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,410

C  M  E
C  M  E

110
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,590
是"看我"
That's "See me."

111
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,560
如果把这些字母当符号
These letters don't make any sense

112
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,960
一点意义都没有
if you think of them as symbols,

113
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,830
但从字面意思来看  就有意义了
but they do if you think of them literally.

114
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,960
"你看到我了吗"  他是在问
"Do you see me?" He's asking

115
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,060
如果你看到了
if you see him.

116
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,330
在哪
Where?

117
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
在这
Here.

118
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,860
大卫・贝克
David Baker?

119
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,030
但除了你们俩  谁能想到
Yeah, but who besides you two, would come up

120
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,360
这样的点子呢
with something like that, huh?

121
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,900
什么意思呢
I mean, what's the point?

122
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,260
我不知道
I don't know,

123
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,360
如果不找出画这张蓝图的人
but we're never going to figure this blueprint out

124
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,530
我们永远不知道其中的意义
if we can't find the person who drew it.

125
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,900
我们要找出大卫・贝克
We need David Baker.

126
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,760

132
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,830
你怎么会得到这些东西

142
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,130
至少档案上没有
At least on paper.

143
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,930

-没有任何跟我们认识的人有关的吗  -我查了
No mention of any of our friends? Hmm. I checked.

你怎么知道这个名字
How do you know that name?

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,500

226
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,280

没听过
I don't believe so.

234
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,280
你还真是个乡巴佬
Well, then, what kind of hillbilly are you, really?

235
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,710
我说给你听吧
I'll explain it to you.

236
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,510
手抓鱼
Noodling...

237
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,540
就是一个有勇无谋的莽夫
is when a foolhardy bastard swims

238
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,980
游到泥泞的河床

240
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,280
黑暗无底的洞里
darkest hole.

241
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,080
抓大鲶鱼

有时  的确有鲶鱼在洞里
Now, sometimes the catfish does live there,

243
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,480
抓鱼者就光着手
and the noodler pulls it out

244
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,640
把鱼拽出来  然后拖回岸边
with his bare hand and he drags it ashore,

245
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,740
但有时候  他把手伸进洞里
but sometimes, he reaches in that hole

246
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,110

潜入"公司"并拿到"锡拉"
into the Company hole and he finds Scylla,

251
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,180
我们把它夺过来  卖给冯
we take it and we sell it to Feng.

252

如果他抓到啮龟

253
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,040
断的也不是我们的手
Not our hand.

承包商来了

-我们需要帮助  -我时刻准备
We need some help. I'm already

He's not taking any new projects right now.

311
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,710
实际上  我想问一些他几年前
Actually, I had some... some questions about something

312
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,040
做的项目的事
that he worked on a few years ago.

313
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,010
你有听过"锡拉"的工程吗
Are you familiar with a project called Scylla?

314
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,410
我正忙呢
I'm working!

315
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
这位先生想跟你谈谈"锡拉"
This man would like to talk to you about Scylla.

316
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,410
你是"公司"的人吗
You're Company?

317
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,940
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

318
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,340
我是后勤的  我想请教一些
I'm in logistics, and I'd like to ask you some questions

319
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,180
有关原始设计的问题
about your original design.

320
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,080
我想了很久才设计出来的
It's been a long time since I thought about that.

321
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,110
幸亏还记得一些
Be lucky to remember anything.

322
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,410
看来你挺忙的
Looks like you're pretty busy.

323
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
介意我看一下吗
Do you mind if I take a look?

324
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,380
知道吗  贝里克救过我
You know, Bellick saved my life.

325
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,980
什么
What?

326
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,480
我们在巴拿马监狱时
Back when we were in prison in Panama.

327
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,210
帝博格简直疯了  他是个疯子
T-Bag went crazy, he, he went nuts.

328
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,810
发生什么了
What happened?

329
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,580
他把索纳一把火烧了  把全部人都放了
He lit Sona on fire, told everyone to run.

330
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,880
他说  他们不会杀光我们的
They can't shoot us all, he said.

331
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,640
简直乱成一团  老兄  我
It was a stampede, bro, I...

332
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,710
我摔倒了  被人踩踏
I was down getting trampled.

333
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,240
站不起来
I, I couldn't get up,

334
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,540
无法呼吸  我以为我死定了
I couldn't breathe, I thought I was going to die...

335
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,240
然后有人把我拉起来
but then something pulled me back to my feet.

336
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,580
是贝里克
It was Bellick.

337
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,180
他救了我
He saved my life.

338
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,940
要弄倒这堵墙吗
That wall's got to come down?!

339
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,510
除非你有更好的办法
Unless you got a better idea.

340
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,480
好吧
Okay.

341
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,710
什么东西
What was that?

342
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,540
不知道  我好像踩到什么了
I don't know. I think I stepped on something.

343
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,940
怎么回事  林肯
What's going on, Linc?

344
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,610
我不知道  老兄
I don't know, man.

345
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,310
像是某种引爆装置
It's some kind of explosive.

346
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,710
炸弹  那我不是死定了
Explosive? Then shouldn't I be dead?

347
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,710
你要是乱动的话  就死定了
If you move, you'll be.

348
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,080
他们在地下  你打不通的
They're underground, you're not going to be able to reach them.

349
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,080
对
Right.

350
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,340
你知道吗
You know what?

351
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,380
没有你  他们也行的
They'll be fine without you.

352
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,040
对
Right.

353
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,980
你听说过福克斯河监狱吗
You ever heard of Fox River?

354
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,180
或许我们可以边吃晚饭边聊聊
Maybe we could talk about it over dinner.

355
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,080
我有洲际公路边上的红虾海鲜馆的优惠卡
I got a gift card to the Red Lobster over off the interstate.

356
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,380
我没想到他们会为布拉德・贝里克这么伤心
I never thought the guys would be so sad for Brad Bellick.

357
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,680
在福克斯河监狱  很多事情都变了
A lot of things have changed since Fox River.

358
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,340
你要知道你掌控不了这些
You know you can't control this.

359
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,780
真的
Yeah?

360
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,580
真有趣  我刚想跟你说同样的话
It's funny, I was just about to tell you the same thing.

361
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,240
不管如何  我们都能应对
Whatever it is, we can manage it.

362
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,710
只要知道我们要应对的是什么
We just need to know what we're dealing with.

363
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,610
如果我不想知道呢
What if I don't want to know?

364
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,440
凯文・弗里林
Kevin Freling

365
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,880
只需几分钟而已
Should only take a few minutes.

366
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,110
准备好了吗
You ready?

367
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,140
好了
I'm ready.

368
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,840
我的目标是建立一个完全自给的城市
My goal is to build one city that entirely self-sustains,

369
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,110
不依靠任何外部资源
depending on no outside resources.

370
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,010
一个完全和谐的社会
A community living entirely in harmony.

371
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,910
还需多久才能转变成现实
How close is it to becoming a reality?

372
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,710
这得看舆论反应了
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

373
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,810
人们认为这些
People look at something

374
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,240
都是不可能的
like this and they think it's impossible.

375
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,080
在现实中  我第二天就能实现这个设想
In reality, I could make it happen tomorrow.

376
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,440
正如他们在迪拜所建设的
Like what they built in Dubai.

377
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,080
没错  把伟大设想
Exactly-- grand ideas

378
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,510
转变成现实
brought into reality.

379
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,610
这不仅只是有益于富人
This won't just serve the rich.

380
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,740
你为他们工作多久了
How long have you been working for them?

381
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,110
太久了
Too long.

382
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,680
94年加入的
I came in in '94.

383
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,810
我从不习惯固定工资
I was never good at collecting a paycheck.

384
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,510
一直是自由职业
Always freelance.

385
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,210
基本上不断辞职
Partially retired all the time.

386
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,340
我喜欢完成一项工作后就往前发展
I like to finish a job and then move on.

387
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,110
把完成的事置于脑后
Put it in the past.

388
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,080
你总是只留名字
Do you always leave your name behind,

389
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,710
而不留正确的工程细则吗
instead of the correct specifications?

390
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,910
只在"锡拉"工程如此而已
Only on the Scylla project.

391
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,480
我们正在考虑修改方案
Well, we're considering modifications and...

392
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,340
我希望你能
I was hoping that you...

393
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,440
帮我指明
could help me figure out

394
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,210
那些蓝图上确切指的是什么
what should really appear on those blueprints.

395
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,680
因为  现在看不出多少意义
As of right now, they don't mean much.

396
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,510
你看了图标符号吗
Didn't you read the legend?

397
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,140
当然
Sure.

398
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,610
但我们还有很多麻烦
But we still had a lot of trouble.

399
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,040
你不是"公司"的人
You're not Company.

400
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,680
我该怎么办
What should I do?

401
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,410
保持冷静
Stay calm.

402
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,180
怎么冷静  你说我踩上地雷了
Calm?! You just said I'm standing on a bomb!

403
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,580
我们会有办法的
We'll work it out.

404
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,210
难道是格雷琴陷害我们
You think Gretchen set us up?

405
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,740
由公司的
"The lessons

406
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,040
创始人哈维・霍尔先生
taught by our founder, Mister..."

407
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,110
传授的课程
"...Harvey Hall."

408
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,080
通向个人自由的路径
"Pathway to personal freedom."

409
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,980
那些人会听这些废话吗
Do people actually buy this nonsense?

410
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,510
放开我
Let go of me.

411
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,740
要么跟我来  要么把你从玻璃门砸过去
You're coming with me or through that glass.

412
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,810
选吧
Choose.

413
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,680
这可是办公地点
This is a place of business.

414
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,310
伽特帮我们找到通向
GATE allows us to find the pathway

415
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,480
个人自由的路径
to personal freedom.

416
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,440
定义我们的范围
Define our boundaries.

417
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,480
并且超出范围考虑
See past them.

418
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,080
让我告诉你们这项伟大工程的
Let me tell you a story about the founder

419
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
创始人的故事
of this great program.

420
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,310
我还是给你们讲比这个俗套的老故事
You know, I'm gonna tell you a better story

421
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,440
更棒的故事  有关被囚禁的故事
about captivity than the regular old spiel.

422
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,410
几年前
Years back,

423
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,380
我在一个当地重罪监狱
I was providing volunteer leadership

424
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,840
当志愿者领导
in a local penitentiary.

425
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
我和一个壮硕魁梧又弓形腿的
I worked with the head guard,

426
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,940
守卫队长布拉德共事
a big, burly, bowlegged Brad.

427
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,380
和恶魔一样可恶
Mean as the devil.

428
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,340
所有罪犯都很怕他  甚至是谋杀犯
All the prisoners were afraid of him, even the murderers.

429
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,410
有一天  布拉德对我说
And one day, Brad said to me,

430
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,180
科尔  我要你离开这里
"Cole, I want you to get out of here.

431
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,080
我要你立刻离开这里
"I want you to get out of here right now,

432
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,010
因为我知道你是个热爱自由的人
'cause I can tell you're a man who loves freedom."

433
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,180
我说  布拉德  那你呢
And I said, "Well, what about you, Brad?

434
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,010
你呢
What about you?"

435
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,110
他说  我嘛
He said, "Oh, yeah, I'm... I'm...

436
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,810
退休时我就自由了
I'm gonna be free someday when I retire."

437
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,880
最近我得知他去世了
I recently got the news that he had passed away.

438
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,480
他在哪过世的呢
And where was he?

439
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,610
还在那个监狱
Still in that prison.

440
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,340
仍然囚禁在充满消极思想的监狱里
Still in the captivity of negativity.

441
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,640
抱歉  各位
Sorry, folks.

442
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,040
老布拉德
Old Brad.

443
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,510
正如我老爸所说的
As my papa used to say,

444
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,740
站直  拿稳酒杯
"Stand by, your glasses steady,

445
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,980
为你的战友干杯
"and drink to your comrade's eyes.

446
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,910
向已故的人致敬
"Here's a toast to the dead already,

447
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,880
为后继的人欢呼
and hurrah for the next to die."

448
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,710
为了确保
I needed to make sure

449
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,610
我能拿到你的诊断结果
that I would have access to your test results,

450
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,740
我跟分拣护士说
so I told the triage nurse

451
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,110
我是你的妻子
that I was your wife.

452
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,680
说得真有一套
Has a nice ring.

453
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,380
你是凯文・弗里林吗
Are you Kevin Freling?

454
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,840
我是
Yes, I am.

455
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,010
我是摩尔登医生
I'm Dr. Malden.

456
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,210
我是神经专科医生  你是
I'm a neurologist. And you're...

457
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,110
我是卡梅伦・艾勃兰  我是一名内科医生
Cameron Eberline. I'm a... an internist.

458
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,680
有结果了吗
Do you have the results?

459
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,140
还要等一会
It's gonna take a little while.

460
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,910
通过家族病史
Uh, looking at the family history,

461
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,610
我想让你留院观察
I'd like to admit you here.

462
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,940
我们在安排病房
We're working on a room.

463
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,110
就现在
Just for now,

464
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,510
直到拿到检查报告
until we get the test results back.

465
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,340
我觉得没必要  但还是谢谢你
I don't think that'll be necessary, but thank you.

466
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,710
你最好能在
It would be best if you could rest

467
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,710
有看护的地方休息
where you could be monitored.

468
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,880
之后  我们再决定
After that, we'll determine

469
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,310
最佳治疗方案
what the best course of action is.

470
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,410
同意吗
Agreed?

471
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,040
抱歉  我们得走了
I think we have to go. I'm sorry.

472
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,640
等等  多长时间
Hold on, hold on-- how long... how long will it take

473
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,810
-能拿到结果  -几小时
to get the results? Couple of hours.

474
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,040
期间我们会给你安排一间病房
But we'll get you in a room before then.

475
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,780
-在这稍等  -谢谢
Just wait here. Thank you.

476
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,640
过来吧
Come on.

477
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,740
你知道会怎样吗
You know what happens?

478
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,280
他们会控制你的生活
They take over your life.

479
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,440
你没法自己掌控
You don't own it anymore.

480
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,040
事情不像你说的那样
That is not what happened to me.

481
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,810
不管怎样  你过去没惹上麻烦
Then, somehow you stayed out of trouble.

482
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,010
你按他们说的做了
You did what they told you to do.

483
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,940
这正是你被困在这的原因  对吧
Maybe that's why you stuck around, huh?

484
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,410
困在洛杉机
Right here in Los Angeles.

485
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
而我  他们抓到我的把柄
In my case, they had something on me,

486
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,510
他们利用这点穷追不舍
and they used it and they never let me go.

487
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,480
他们杀人无数
They've killed hundreds, thousands of people

488
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,780
谋权求势  你一清二楚
in the pursuit of power, you know that.

489
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
我们昨天就牺牲了一名想阻止他们的同志
We lost a good man yesterday trying to stop them.

490
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,110
他们伤害了太多人  大卫
They hurt a lot of people, David.

491
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,780
大卫
David.

492
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,440
听着
Look...

493
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,140
我不参与政治
I stay out of the politics.

494
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,710
那只是份工作
It was a job.

495
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,280
我专门负责安全工程
I specialized in security engineering.

496
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,810
"锡拉"工程只是个选择性的任务  所以我就接受了
The Scylla project was a choice assignment, so I took it.

497
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,940
他们告诉你那是什么了  对吧
They told you what it was, didn't they?

498
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,380
他们跟你说了它  如今
They told you what it was, and now

499
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,610
你希望你从没帮过他们  但你被骗了
you wish that you never helped them, but you're trapped.

500
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,040
正如我被陷害一样
You're trapped like I was.

501
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,540
你说得好像就在眼前的事
You talk like it's all in the present.

502
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,840
确实如此
It is!

503
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,810
我知道你想忘掉过去
I know you want to move on.

504
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,310
看看你在做什么
Look at what you're doing.

505
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,140
你在努力弥补吧
Are you trying to make up for something?

506
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,340
忘了美好的未来吧
Forget the charitable city of the future,

507
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,980
还是关心一下你眼前的生活吧  大卫
and worry about the world that you live in right now, David.

508
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,610
他们做过的  他们要做的
What they did.what they're doing.

509
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,210
都不是我的错
is not my fault.

510
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,840
你把名字留在那里肯定有原因
You put your name in there for a reason.

511
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,080
你想让人找到你
You wanted someone to find you,

512
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,440
如果你说出我想要的信息
and if you tell me what I need to know,

513
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,710
我能为彼此做出努力
I can do something for both of us.

514
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,140
你丈夫在哪
Where is your husband?

515
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,140
他出去办公了  一会才能回来
He went to run some errands-- he should be right back.

516
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,480
车道停的不是他的车吗
That's his car in the driveway, isn't it?

517
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,510
稍等  我打电话叫他
Just a moment. I'll call him on his cell.

518
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
-你们干嘛  -要求派人前后包抄
Excuse me.I request southeast to work.

519
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,350
你早就知道  对吧
You knew about this, didn't you?

520
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,420
首先  我不知道
First of all, I have no idea

521
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,080
"公司"为何
why the Company would want

522
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,180
在自己楼下
to put an explosive device

523
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,650
放何种爆炸装置
of any kind under their own building.

524
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,350
-我们在中庭下方  -告诉你
We're under the courtyard. And you know what,

525
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,720
我完全不知情
I honestly had no idea

526
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,380
这里会有这些东西
that any of this was even here.

527
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,880
这么看来
That being said...

528
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,380
这看起来像JZ33杀伤性地雷
These look a lot like JZ33 anti-personnel blast mines.

529
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,950
过去  在费卢杰
Back in Fallujah,

530
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,220
伊斯兰游击战士把它们埋在基地外面
the Muj used to bury them outside their firm base.

531
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,280
除掉他们
Get rid of them.

532
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,780
我不是专家  但我有主意
I'm no expert, but I have an idea.

533
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,520
什么在哔哔叫
What's beeping?

534
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,080
哔哔声啊
It beeps!

535
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,050
你肯定直接踩到上面
Wow, you must've stepped on this just right.

536
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,950
你的重心平均
Your weight is evenly distributed

537
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
分布在压板上
across the pressure plate,

538
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,980
没有触动引线
and you haven't engaged the firing pin.

539
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,550
一英寸你都不能挪
You can't move an inch.

540
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,580
我们知道
We know.

541
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,080
你有什么主意
What's your idea?

542
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,850
我的想法是他挪一英寸
Well, my idea is that he moves an inch.

543
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,320
这样  我就能深入洞里
That way, I can get to the hole,

544
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,720
拆除引线
and I can dismantle the firing pin.

545
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,780
他现在站在上面  我无能为力
Right now, he's standing on it, and I can't do anything.

546
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,420
不行  林肯  打电话给你弟弟[西班牙语]
No, no, no, Linc,  llama tu hermano.

547
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,480
-什么  -快打电话给你弟弟
What? Call your brother, please.

548
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,550
你给我呆在这里
You-- you stay here.

549
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,650
行
Fine.

550
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,120
是我哥哥
It's my brother.

551
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,320
迈克尔
Michael...

552
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,320
我们走
Let's go.

553
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,650
莎拉
Sara...

554
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,880
你们不是要走吧
You're not leaving, are you?

555
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,280
你有我们的号码
You have our number.

556
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,280
你到底是谁
And who are you again?

557
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,420
他想在家等结果
He prefers to wait at home.

558
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,150
-我会照看他  -他可能有危险
I'm monitoring him. He's leaving AMA

559
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,180
不能离开医院
in a potentially fragile condition.

560
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,820
听着  我不是傻瓜
Look, I'm not stupid.

561
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,620
我知道你们是谁
I know who you are,

562
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,950
我不会告发你们
and I'm not gonna turn you in.

563
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,580
我关心的是
My concern is for what's going on

564
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,820
你的健康
with your health.

565
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,320
他们不是来抓你们的
They aren't here for you,

566
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,450
我告诉你  以你的状况
and I'm telling you, in your condition...

567
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,620
谢谢你医生  我很感激你帮忙
Thank you, Doctor; I appreciate your help.

568
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,180
拜托打电话给我们
Please do call us.

569
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,680
有事吗
Can I help you?

570
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,120
我搞砸了
I messed up.

571
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,050
什么意思
What do you mean?

572
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,050
今天  我跟巴格维尔一起办事时
Today, I was working with Bagwell.

573
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,680
他很顺从
He's been compliant as hell.

574
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,720
我想我可以让他高兴
I thought that I would make him happy.

575
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,980
-他想谈论格雷琴・摩根  -行  到底怎么了
He wanted to talk about Gretchen Morgan. Right, and what happened?

576
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,820
而我说漏嘴了
And I slipped up.

577
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,350
我提到惠斯勒了
I mentioned Whistler.

578
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,350
我告诉你这很棘手
This one is tough, I'm telling you.

579
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,050
巴格维尔  格雷琴・摩根  他们很凶残
Bagwell, Gretchen Morgan-- they're thugs.

580
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,920
我不止一次被人
I have been face down with a gun

581
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,880
拿枪指着我的头
to the back of my head more than once.

582
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,250
好吧
All right.

583
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,750
听着  我不想让你去做
Look, I don't want you to do something

584
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,980
你不想做的事情
that you don't want to do.

585
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,420
你是个好特工  我们可以安排其他人
You're a good agent-- we could reassign...

586
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,420
不  我不是这个意思
No, no, that is not it.

587
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,050
听着  我能搞掂这个
Look, I can handle this.

588
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,080
我只是
I'm just...

589
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,420
我只是在鞭策自己
I'm just kicking myself.

590
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,350
我可以安排其他事给你做
I could find something else for you to do, okay?

591
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,480
这件事你就别管了
This thing has gotten way out of hand.

592
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,650
达洛在后方  并且"公司"正在转移"锡拉"
Dallow is on my back, and the Company is moving Scylla...

593
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,420
不
No.

594
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,350
我能行
I'm fine.

595
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,050
你确定吗
Are you sure?

596
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,720
唐  我真的觉得我们能行
I really think we can do this, Don.

597
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,250
我们能搞垮"公司"
We can bring the Company down.

598
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,020
我把名字记在蓝图上完全是自负
Ego is the only reason I coded my name into those blueprints.

599
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,680
我不觉得有什么好心虚的
I don't feel guilty about anything.

600
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,820
我得接这个电话  不好意思
I gotta take this. I'm sorry.

601
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,820
喂
Hello?

602
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
-阿历克斯 我们  -怎么了
Alex, we...What?

603
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,950
有麻烦了
Got a problem.

604
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,620
那里有个该死的雷区
There's a damn minefield down there.

605
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,320
喂  我听不清
Hello, I can't hear you.

606
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,650
苏克雷有麻烦了
Sucre's in trouble.

607
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,880
他踩到地雷了
He's standing on a mine.

608
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,150
我们得把它拆了
We need to deactivate it.

609
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,280
林肯  我得挂了  一会打给你
Linc, I gotta go. I'll call you back.

610
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,450
他们来了  大卫
They're here, David.

611
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,150
-他们想从我这要什么  -他们在转移"锡拉"
What do they want from me? They're moving Scylla,

612
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,550
保护它  所有你为他们做的
protecting it-- everything you did for them,

613
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,050
他们想让你再做一次
they want you to do it again.

614
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,450
你觉得你能阻止他们吗
You think you can stop them?

615
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,820
我了解你
I know all about you.

616
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,120
我六个月前就知道了
I've known about you for six months.

617
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,450
自从有人从公司偷了
ever since somebody stole those plans

618
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,780
设计图
from the Company.

619
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,980
一切都是徒劳
It will never work.

620
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,450
你们连第一堵墙都过不去
You won't get past the first wall.

621
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,680
第一堵墙指什么
What about the first wall?

622
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,020
有什么障碍  雷区吗
What's gonna stop me, huh? The minefield?

623
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,350
千万别告诉他们
Please... don't tell 'em.

624
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
我们抓到他了  清理现场
We've got him. Sweep the area.

625
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,980
山脚下有条泥路
There's a dirt road at the bottom of the hill.

626
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,240
从那条路出去
It will take you out.

627
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,680
-你丈夫  -只管走
Your husband... Just go.

628
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,440
他帮不了你  这个东西可以
He won't help you; that will.

629
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,860
"锡拉"工程
Scylla Project

630
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,010
林肯  再给他打电话
Lincoln, go call him again.

631
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,710
林肯  快打啊
Linc, go call him.

632
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,140
快啊  林肯
Linc, go call him!

633
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,780
迈克尔知道怎么处理吗
What will Michael know about this?

634
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,240
这完全超出他的知识领域
I mean, it's not exactly within his realm of expertise.

635
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,310
我们这是浪费时间
We're wasting time.

636
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,640
我给的是半专业化建议
I gave you a semiprofessional assessment.

637
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,880
那又如何
What's wrong?

638
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,340
你不相信我吗  费尔南多
You don't trust me, Fernando?

639
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,110
他为何要相信你
Why should he?

640
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,510
因为我们的目标一致  "锡拉"
Because we all want the same thing: Scylla.

641
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,040
我不会让一大包爆竹
And I'm not gonna let a giant pack

642
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,340
挡我们的路
of firecrackers stand in our way.

643
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,280
要不我给你找个拆弹小组
Or would you like me to call the bomb squad?

644
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,180
听着  我现在是好心相助
Look, I am offering to do you a massive favor here.

645
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,340
我拆引线时  这东西要是炸了
If that thing blows while I'm pulling the pin,

646
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,510
他丢的是一条腿  我丢的可是头
he loses a leg-- I lose a face!

647
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,840
费尔南多  别担心
Now, don't worry, Fernando.

648
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,480
我出了名手稳
I'm known for my steady hand.

649
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,510
深呼吸  好吧
Take a deep breath, okay?

650
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,240
保持重心平稳
Keep your weight even.

651
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,240
然后慢慢移动
And I need you to shift slowly,

652
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,140
慢慢的
very slowly--

653
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,910
往左挪一英寸  我就能拆引线了
one inch to your left, so I can get to the pin.

654
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,840
不行  我做不到
Oh, no, I can't... I can't, I can't do it.

655
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,980
你还好吧
Are you all right?

656
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,680
有什么消息吗
Have you, uh, heard anything?

657
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,380
他们得拆除它
They have to deactivate.

658
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,880
我拿到张图表
I got a key.

659
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,710
蓝图中的图标符号
A legend to the blueprint.

660
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,640
-贝克给你的吗  -不是
Baker gave you this? No.

661
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,480
他老婆给我的  他们找上贝克了
His wife gave it to me. They came for Baker.

662
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,340
好了  这样就清楚多了
All right, well, this makes more sense.

663
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,580
这些符号
These, uh, these symbols

664
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,580
不是代表P型管  代表的是
aren't for p-traps, they're...

665
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,580
麦克风
they're microphones.

666
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,410
字母V代表真空装置
And the letter "V" isn't for vacuum,

667
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,280
那是发电机
that's a generator.

668
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,280
这是一条JZ33的布雷线
This is a line of JZ33 land mines

669
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,740
埋在地下8毫米处
buried 80 millimeters underground,

670
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,740
离外墙大概有7英尺
about seven feet from the outer wall

671
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,780
肯定是林肯和我说的事
that's must be what Linc was talking about.

672
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:48,780
上面说  只能手动操作
It says, "Manual override only.

673
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,910
所有常规拆除JZ33的方式
All conventional attempts to dismantle the JZ33

674
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,610
均会触发"锡拉"警报
will activate the Scylla alarms."

675
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,310
这不仅仅是个地雷
This isn't just a land mine.

676
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,080
还是个报警器
This is, uh... this is an alarm.

677
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,480
我们不能耗一个晚上
We can't sit here all night.

678
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,640
准备好了吗
Okey?You ready?

679
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,180
我是林肯  你知道怎么做
it's Linc. You know what to do.

680
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,610
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

681
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,340
林肯
Linc!

682
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,380
苏克雷
Sucre!

683
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,940
住手
Stop!

684
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,380
快住手
Stop!

685
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,380
别动
Don't move.

686
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,410
别动
Don't move.

687
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,510
千万别的
Don't move.

688
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,840
不关掉警报
You can't dismantle the land mine

689
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,780
-你是拆不了地雷的  -也就是说
without setting off the alarm. So I either

690
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,810
不但关不了警报
set off the alarm

691
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,040
-我还会被炸死  -不
or blow up and die. No.

692
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,340
有一个手动装置
There's a manual override.

693
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,680
切断电源后有足够时间
It'll cut the power long enough for you

694
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,240
让你不拆引线退后
to step off without removing the pin.

695
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,280
你怎么肯定吗
How do you know for sure?

696
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,440
我找到大卫・贝克了
I found David Baker.

697
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,740
苏克雷  退后
Sucre. Step off.

698
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,180
你可以的
You can do it. You only have

699
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,880
你只有20秒时间  快点
20 seconds. Come on.

700
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,880
-我做不到  -你可以的
I can't... Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

701
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,210
我和迈克尔研究过了
Michael and I figured it out.

702
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,240
现在就退后
Step off right now.

703
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,580
不  你们都走吧  我
No, no, you guys all go. I'll--

704
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,480
我们不必都死  我自己承担吧
We all don't have to die. I'll do it alone.

705
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,640
今天没有人会死
Nobody's gonna die today!

706
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,710
退后
Step off!

707
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,180
退后
Step off.

708
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,810
墙后面是什么
What's behind this wall?

709
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
锡拉
Scylla.

710
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,980
你们什么时候能知道结果
When do you find out?

711
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,010
医生随时都有可能打电话来
The doctor is supposed to call, uh... any minute.

712
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,010
听着
Look, um...

713
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,040
我很抱歉今天没去帮你们
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you today.

714
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,480
别担心
Don't worry about it.

715
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,640
格雷琴为苏克雷所做的
You know, what Gretchen did for Sucre

716
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,640
让我觉得我们可以信任她
made me realize we could use her.

717
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,680
我问她要第六张卡
I asked for the sixth key.

718
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,680
她怎么说
What'd she say?

719
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,710
她在努力
She's on it.

720
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,040
你没事吧
You all right?

721
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,010
好了
All right.

722
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,480
我们准备去机场
We're about to go to the airfield.

723
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,510
把布拉德的尸体运给他母亲
We're gonna ship Brad's body off to his mother.

724
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,680
他的遗物都在这
Got his things here.

725
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,110
他在哪
Where is he?

726
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,780
这边
Over here.

727
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:52,080
他妈妈会为此感激的
His mother will appreciate that.

728
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,140
贝里克夫人
Mrs. Bellick.

729
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,180
我是费尔南多・苏克雷
This is Fernando Sucre.

730
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,240
今天干的不错
Great job today.

731
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,910
我对你朋友的死感到遗憾
I'm sorry to hear about your friend.

732
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,740
但那是令人尊敬的工作
But that's, um, admirable work,

733
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,110
志愿看管那样一群罪犯
volunteering with a bunch of criminals like that.

734
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,410
我们都是一样的
We're all the same, really.

735
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,180
这是你要的
Here's the application you requested

736
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,280
前台的申请表
for the desk girl.

737
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,310
谢谢
Thanks.

738
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,080
祝你晚上愉快  科尔
You have a good night, Cole.

739
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,980
你也是  谢谢
You, too. Thanks.

740
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,280
喂
Hello?

741
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
喂
Hello?

742
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,510
好的
Okay.

743
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,680
我们会的
We will.

744
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,510
谢谢
Thank you.

745
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,010
吃过一番苦头
As we've all learned the hard way,

746
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,680
我们已知道在地基周边
there's an electronic alarm barrier

747
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,710
装有电子报警设备
around the perimeter of the foundation.

748
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,710
不幸的是
Unfortunately,

749
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,610
那是锡拉最外层的防线
that is Scylla's most primitive line of defense.

750
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,610
那面墙
The wall itself

751
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,180
用钢纤维设防
is fortified with steel fiber.

752
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,740
好消息是  在里面
The good news is, on the inside here,

753
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,910
没有监控录像
there are no cameras.

754
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,340
公司不想留下任何
The Company doesn't want any

755
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,340
证明"锡拉"存在的视觉图像
visual evidence that Scylla exists.

756
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,240
坏消息是  这边和这边
The bad news is that there are both

757
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,910
都有重量和扩音传感器
weight and microphonic sensors here and here

758
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,940
一旦有任何超过
that will alert Company Security

759
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,280
2磅的活人出现
to the presence of any breathing human being

760
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,110
就会拉响"公司"的安全警报
that weighs more than two pounds.

761
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,080
我现在能确定的
as far as I can tell,

762
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,940
第一个挑战  是避开那堵墙
the first challenge is getting around that wall.

763
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,840
然后再考虑如何跨过那块地
And then we can worry about crossing the floor.

764
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,880
不能碰到地面
Without touching it.

765
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,880
还得悄无声息
In silence.

766
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,280
太复杂了
It's complicated.

767
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,240
但我已经在研究了
But, uh, I'm already working on something.

768
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,410
布拉德没有白白牺牲
Brad didn't die in vain.

769
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,980
我们会成功的
We can make this work.

770
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,610
神经专科医生打来的电话
That was the neurologist.

771
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,640
你长了个下丘脑错构瘤
You have a hypothalamus hamaratoma.

772
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,910
十分罕见
It's really rare.

773
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,840
你可能天生就有
