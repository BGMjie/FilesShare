00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,160
《越狱》第四季 第二十集
Prison.Break.S04E20

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,550
《越狱》 前情提要
Previously on prison break.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,960
你准备什么时候告诉我
When were you planning on

4
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,720
你母亲是幕后主使
Telling me that your mother was behind you on this?

5
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,200
你只有今天一天的时间了
You have today, one day.

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,180
当布鲁斯把锡拉带回来的时候
When Burrows brings Scylla back to us,

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,730
你就是让他脑袋开花的那个人
You will be the one to put a bullet in his brain.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,740
纳文・班纳吉
Naveen banerjee,

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,520
是南都・班纳吉总理的儿子
The son of prime minister Nandu Banerjee.

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,640
当这一切都过去了
Soon, this will all be behind us,

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,490
我可能还有机会见到我的孙子
And maybe I can meet my grandson.

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,610
林肯在哪里
Where's Linc?!

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,410
现在正在开一个能源会议
There's an energy conference.

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,480
在熊猫湾酒店  他会在那里
The Panda Bay Hotel. He'll be there.

15
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,850
克里斯蒂娜的计划
Christina's plan...

16
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,580
她利用锡拉从中渔利所欠的东风
what she needed to profit from Scylla,

17
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,600
就是一种让事态升级为世界大战的催化剂
an incident that'll domino into global warfare.

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,070
不要
No!

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,800
他们用林肯的名字租了这个
They rented this in Linc's name.

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,380
看看这里  这是个陷阱
Look at this. It's a setup!

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,570
弹壳上都是他的指纹
His hands are all over the shells.

22
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,640
林肯这回可是竹篮打水一场空了
Lincoln's right back where he started.

23
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,500
这样对迈克尔太残忍了
It really is too bad about Michael.

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,280
我们得赶快离开
We gotta go.

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,250
我需要医生
I need a doctor here!

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,190
他们在那里
There they are!

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,210
他们在楼上
They're up there! They're up there!

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,570
我们快上楼
Let's go upstairs, now!

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,220
快上  上
Move it, move it!

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,330
我们混到人群里面吧
Look, let's just blend into the crowd.

31
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,660
我们不能那么出去
No, we can't go that way.

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,420
门锁上了  迈克尔
The door is locked, Michael.

33
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,780
退后
Stand back.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,740
这事越来越麻烦了
This whole thing is falling apart.

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,430
你觉得呢
Is it?

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,380
真的吗
Is it really?

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,550
你觉得现在这样很好笑吗
What, do you think this is funny? Huh?

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,720
你觉得这事情会多快
How long do you think it's gonna take

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,050
传到将军那里去的
Before the general sees this on the news?

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,520
如果他觉得我们拿不到锡拉
If he thinks we can't get Scylla,

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,940
你觉得他会花多久时间来灭了我们
How long do you think it's gonna take before he comes after us?

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,420
我们的家人也将在劫难逃
And then he comes after our families?

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,250
确实很搞笑  对吧
Yeah, it's really funny, isn't it?

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,390
迈克尔  你在哪
Michael, where are you?

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,390
我们还在宾馆里
We're still in the hotel.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,390
有没有其他办法
Is there any other way

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,640
出来的时候不被人发现吗
To get out of here without being seen?

48
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,720
没有  到处都是警察和联邦探员
No, there's cops and feds all over the place.

49
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,810
你拿到锡拉了吗
Did you get Scylla?

50
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,010
没有
No.

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,460
有人被暗杀了
Some guy got assassinated.

52
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,410
你猜猜谁又被陷害了
And guess who got set up for it.

53
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,470
我们需要锡拉
We need Scylla.

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,820
锡拉不见了
Scylla is gone!

55
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,320
我现在只想
The only thing I care about right now

56
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,470
从这里逃出去
Is getting out of here.

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,970
是吗  你能往哪儿逃呢  迈克尔
Oh, yeah? Where you gonna go, Michael, huh?

58
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,750
我们会再次陷入公司的穷追猛打中
With the company breathing down our back again.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
斯科菲尔德  我是当
Scofield, it's Don.

60
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,450
你想干什么
What do you want?

61
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,500
帮你解决问题
To try to fix this.

62
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,610
怎么解决
How?

63
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,780
又想背后捅我们一刀
By stabbing us in the back again?

64
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,170
让阿历克斯和我说话
Put alex on.

65
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,950
他现在不太好分心
He's a little preoccupied right now.

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,990
如果你想冲我发火
Look, you want to be mad at me,

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,890
等我们拿到了锡拉再发火也不迟
be mad at me after we get Scylla back.

68
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,820
现在听我说
Now listen to me.

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,380
西南边的卸货区有一扇工业门
Okay, the southwest loading dock is a large industrial door.

70
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,260
不是一个快速逃生口
It's not conducive to a quick exit.

71
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,350
只有一个警察把守着
They only have one cop on it.

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,630
你们到门口时  我来解决那个警察
When you get to the door, I can incapacitate the cop.

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,720
问题是  我们在宾馆的另一边
Problem is, we're on the other side of the hotel,

74
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,840
而他们把一楼封锁了
and they've got the ground floor covered.

75
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,800
你们在外边还看见了什么
What else can you see on the outside?

76
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,110
没了  只有警察
Nothing, just the cop,

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,030
垃圾箱  叉车和装换洗衣服的箱子
A couple of dumpsters, jack pallets and some laundry bins.

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,280
那就是说宾馆的洗衣房在另一边
That must mean the on-site laundry's on the other side of the hotel,

79
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,030
靠近卸货区大门
Near the loading dock door.

80
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,520
如果我们能到洗衣房  我们就能到大门
If we get to the laundry, we can get to the door.

81
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,150
你说过我们不能到宾馆另一边
You said we can't make it across the hotel.

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,460
但是我们可以从屋顶过去
But we can get access to the roof.

83
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,290
宾馆都是用屋顶通风设备
Hotels use rooftop ventilation,

84
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,130
这样  客人才不会闻到洗衣房的味道
So the hotel guests don't smell the laundry fumes.

85
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,130
那好  那就从通风设施那边
Okay, so, listen, take the ventilation system

86
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,200
到洗衣房  如果你们能到洗衣房
To the laundry room. If you can get to the laundry room,

87
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,890
你们就能到大门口
You're gonna get right by the door.

88
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,840
打开免提功能
Put me on speaker.

89
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,310
阿历克斯  你想摆脱公司对我们的纠缠吗
Alex, you want to get the company off our backs?

90
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,870
到邓恩街4号
Go to 4 Dunn place.

91
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,810
莎拉正看着我妈
Sara's holding my mother there.

92
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,900
让她告诉我们锡拉在什么地方
Make her tell us where Scylla is.

93
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,690
还我们一个清白
And clear our names in all this.

94
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,550
马宏  你一定要想尽一切办法撬开她的嘴
Mahone, you need to do whatever you gotta do to get her talk

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,890
你明白吗
You hear me?

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,890
该怎么做  就怎么做
Do whatever you gotta do.

97
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,750
明白
Got it.

98
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,650
我们走
Come on.

99
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,090
熊猫湾酒店现在是一片混乱
It is complete mayhem at the Panda Bay Hotel

100
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,310
纳文・班纳吉  印度总理的儿子
Where Naveen Banerjee, The son of india's prime minister,

101
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,560
在这里被暗杀了
Has been assassinated.

102
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,200
有趣的是  有小道消息透露
Amazingly, there have been unconfirmed reports

103
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,350
暗杀者正是林肯・布鲁斯
Identifying the assailants as none other than Lincoln Burrows,

104
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,710
杀害泰伦斯・斯坦曼的那个嫌疑犯
the man who'd been suspected of murdering Terrence Steadman,

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,580
还有他弟弟兼策划者迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
And Michael Scofield, his mastermind brother...

106
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,720
克里斯蒂娜把我们都给耍了
Christina sandbagged all of us!

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,630
如果他们兄弟俩被抓了
If the brothers are caught,

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,210
我们就不能保证
We have no control over what

109
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,970
他们会对警察说什么了
They might say to the authorities.

110
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,470
到酒店去
Get down to that hotel

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,790
保证他们不会胡说八道
And make sure they don't have that opportunity.

112
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,290
将军  我非常愿意来接手这项行动
Uh, general, I'd be more than willing to take on that assignment.

113
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,590
我保证  我一定会指挥有方的
And I assure you I will dispatch of it efficiently.

114
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,430
泰迪  我们不是在玩捕猎游戏
This is not an alabama coon hunt, Teddy.

115
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,960
别以为我是一时冲动
Don't judge me by desperate actions

116
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,600
刀架在脖子上的日子我都挺过来了
I've taken when there's been a gun to my head.

117
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,320
我领导监狱里的黑帮
I ran an entire prison gang syndicate.

118
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,820
再心狠手辣的罪犯都奉我为上宾
Hardened felons called me "Mister."

119
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,110
我不是一个告密的小人
I'm so much more than a snitch.

120
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,970
如果你以为我只是那样的人
And if you continue to treat me as such,

121
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,140
那就是你的损失  我无所谓  将军阁下
It will be your loss, General, not mine.

122
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,950
孩子  我手里掌握着一家几百万亿
Son, I have the fate of a multi-trillion dollar

123
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,620
资产公司的命运
enterprise in my hands,

124
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,960
你认为现在我会让你大出风头吗
And you want me to let you earn your stripes now?!

125
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,570
摆平那兄弟俩
Take care of the brothers.

126
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,150
应该是这了
This should be it.

127
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,450
好极了
Perfect.

128
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,560
他们说我们的人马上就到
They say ours should be here shortly.

129
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,900
你们要提高警惕
I want you guys on full alert

130
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,020
时刻准备行动  好吗
And get all geared up, all right?

131
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,070
他们在那
It's them!

132
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,880
别动
Stop!

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,890
他们会在任何一层楼出现
They could be on any floor.

134
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,710
你能控制所有的门锁吗
Can you override the door locks?

135
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,730
可以  都是电子锁
Yeah, they're electronic.

136
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,930
我们在楼下控制
We control everything from down here.

137
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,860
我要酒店的所有房间门都锁上
I want every room in this hotel locked down now!

138
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,690
我们为什么不走楼梯去天台
Why don't we just take the stairs to the roof?

139
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,740
因为我们将拉响火警
Because we'll set off the fire alarm.

140
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,330
通过顶楼房间上方夹层的管道
The ducts in the crawl spaces above these top floor rooms,

141
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,950
才是我们到天台的通道
That's how we get our rooftop access.

142
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,780
只要我们找到了洗衣房的通风口
Once we find the laundry vent,

143
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,230
我们就从那里到卸货区
We take that down to the loading dock.

144
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,550
门全锁了
That should do it.

145
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,800
出什么事了
What's going on?

146
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,160
他们把我们关在门外了
They locked us out.

147
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,410
我们到不了天台
We can't get to the roof.

148
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,580
那我们往回走下楼去
Let's head back down.

149
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,940
警察会在楼梯井等着我们
There'll be cops in the stairwell.

150
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,610
无论上下  我们都走投无路了
We can't go up, we can't go down...

151
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,060
我们被困住了
We're trapped.

152
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,290
熊猫湾暗杀事件现在有了新的进展

克里斯蒂娜  你给过他活路

他走了自己的路  选择和我们干到底

176
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,690

到处都是警察

就好像是蚂蚁们倾巢出动了一样

他们非常和蔼可亲

布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德有可能全副武装
Burrows and Scofield could be armed to the teeth.

186

楼梯的空间很窄
It's tight quarters in the stairwell,

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,180
我不想看到枪战  明白吗

不是普通的团伙暴力

迈阿密的破案环境是不是让你退化了

直接影响了我们国家的安全

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,240

但是  你要跟在我后面

我不会让你来转一圈之后
I'm not gonna have you running around playing

203
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,880
让你回去好跟你的朋友吹嘘
So you can go back to your buddies at the office

204
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,800
你经历过真正的枪林弹雨  懂吗

没问题
Not a problem.

206
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,220
那你现在告诉我
Now, why don't you start by telling me

207
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,250
你准备怎么解决问题
How you're gonna diffuse the situation?

208
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,920
我们会逐层放烟雾弹  直到找到他们
We're gonna gas them out floor by floor until we find them.

209
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,920
等一下  如果你要用烟雾弹

210
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,760
你们也什么都看不见  我不能
Compromise visibility ,and I can't afford

211
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,590
再冒险让某个外交官脑袋挨枪子儿了
Another diplomat getting shot in the fez.

212
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,310
我们用的是氯丙烷

213
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,100
无色  无味
It's colorless, it's odorless.

214
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,160
他们根本不会察觉到自己是怎么中的招
They won't even know what hit them.

215
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,870
大家听好
All right, listen up.

216
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,120
两个人在东边的楼梯井放烟雾
I want two men in the east stairwell with the gas,

217
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,770
两个在西边楼梯底下
Two at the base of the west stairwell

218
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,410
防止他们再往楼下逃
In case they try to come back down again.

219
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,290
我会准备好后援  行了吗
I'll have backup detail ready, all right?

220
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,420
行动  动作快
Let's go, move, move!

221
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,970
莎拉

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,650
天哪

223
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,980
莎拉
Sara.

224
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,150

我还好  克里斯蒂娜跑了
I'm fine. Christina's gone.

227
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,920
最下面抽屉里面有刀

228
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,760
你知道她去哪了吗

229
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,520
不知道
No.

230
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,000
锡拉在她手里
She has Scylla.

231
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,930
她设计陷害了林肯和迈克尔
She set up Linc and Michael.

232
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,930
她可能躲在任何地方

233
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,390
迈克尔和林肯
Michael and Lincoln?

234
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,530
他们现在背上了杀害印度官员的黑锅

他们现在是新闻头条

236
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,650
这个克里斯蒂娜的计划
That was Christina's plan, and...

237
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,120

被困在了熊猫湾酒店里

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,860
知道了
Okay.

241
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,070
你不能过去

到处都是警察
The cops are everywhere.

243
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,750
你不要拦着我
I really need you to get out of my way

244
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,990
这我办不到
Well, that's not gonna happen.

245
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,280
你不关心我  我也不关心你
You don't care for me, I don't care for you

246
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,340
但是我欠迈克尔的  你逃吧
Much either, but I owe Michael, okay? Run.

247
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,000
他现在正在水深火热之中
He's in a sea of trouble right now.

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,150
我不会抛弃他
I'm not abandoning him.

249
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,990
我不是让你抛弃他
I'm not telling you

250
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,540
你什么忙也帮不了
To abandon him. There's nothing you can do for him.

251
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,860
我要是想跑  早就跑了
Listen, I'd run if I could run.

252
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,720
但是我跑的话  他们就会对我老婆下手
But if I run, they go after my wife,

253
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,260
所以我才会再陷泥沼
So I have to jump back in.

254
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,260
你不需要
You don't.

255
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,480
我不会逃避
I'm not running.

256
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,020
我要留在这里
I'll stay here, okay?

257
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,990
这样  迈克尔才会知道我在哪
That way, Michael knows where I am.

258
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,850
克里斯蒂娜也会知道
So does Christina.

259
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,270
如果她想让我死  我早就死了
If she wanted me dead, I would be already.

260
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,110
随便你吧
Suit yourself.

261
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,970
阿历克斯
Alex?

262
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,110

263
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,700
如果你看见迈克尔  告诉他我在这里
And if you see Michael, tell him I'm here.

264
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,340
好的
Yeah.

265
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,900
我明白这对你有多痛苦
I know how difficult this must be for you.

266
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,100
总理先生  我也失去了一个儿子
Mr. Prime Minister, I, too, lost a son

267
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,860
当他还是个孩童的时候
When he was just a child.

268
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,030
你的儿子是被刺客害死的吗
Was your son murdered by an assailant's bullet?

269
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,530
当然不是
Of course not.

270
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,920
有消息说那帮中国人是幕后主使
I've heard the news that the Chinese are behind this.

271
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,370
对  我也听说了
Yes, I've heard that as well.

272
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,760
所以我来这儿了
And that's why I'm here.

273
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,260
不是为了讨论我儿子是怎么死的
Not to discuss how my son died,

274
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,760
而是怎么为他报仇雪恨
But how to avenge him.

275
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,080
你所说的 "技术"
Your technology-- as you put it--

276
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,430
我听说了有关它多种用途的风声
I've heard rumors of its varied applications.

277
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,300
南都  我们稍安勿躁
Nandu, let's take a breath here.

278
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,310
不  我儿子死的那一刻我就无法平静了
No! The time to take a breath expired when my son died.

279
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,760
你儿子和我已经计划把这项技术
Your son and I had planned to use the technology

280
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,770
用于人道主义关怀
For humanitarian endeavors.

281
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,770
我们的目标不是将其用于战争
Warfare applications were not our goal.

282
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,570
但既然它们已经归我了  而且归根结底
But now they are mine, and at the end of the day,

283
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,240
你只是一个做买卖的商人
You're a businesswoman with a product

284
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,490
而我是买家
And I am a buyer.

285
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,410
我要买下你所拥有的全部知识产权
I want to commit to all the intellectual property you possess.

286
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,420
我要中国血债血偿
I want the People's Republic of China To feel the pain I feel right now!

287
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,020
你清楚
Do you comprehend the ramifications

288
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,320
你这项提议的后果吗
Of what it is you're proposing?

289
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,730
比你还清楚
More than you know.

290
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,160
如你所愿
If it is what you want.

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,660
我必须得走了
I must go now...

292
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,590
准备付款事宜
To make arrangements for your payment

293
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,840
和我儿子的葬礼
And arrangements for my child's burial.

294
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,650
喂

295
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
恭喜啊  你们又出名了
Congratulations. You're famous again.

296
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,290
新闻上全都在说你们杀了另一个甘地
You're all over the news for killing Gandhi.

297
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,160
我也料到会这样
I figured as much.

298
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,250
对啊  情况越来越糟糕了
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

299
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,660
-他们要用烟雾弹逼你们出来  -什么时候
- They're gonna gas you out. - When?

300
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,120
他们已经在行动了  他们在一层层排查
They already started. They're going floor-by-floor.

301
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,950
现在大概已经到达第三或第四层楼了
They're about at the third or fourth floor right now.

302
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,300
你现在为什么要告诉我这些
Why are you just telling me about this now?

303
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,790
我必须要离开门廊
I had to leave the lobby.

304
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,440
我不能再引更多人怀疑了
I can't make anybody more suspicious.

305
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,030
喂  迈克尔  迈克尔
Hello, Michael? Michael?

306
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,640
林肯  我需要你的帮助
Linc, I need your help.

307
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,190
我四年级的时候
When I was in fourth grade,

308
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,410
我猜对了试卷上所有答案  结果得了A
I... I got an A for guessing all the answers on this test.

309
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,250
我从没想过我竟能考这么高
I never thought I'd beat those odds.

310
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,370
什么样的倒霉蛋才会在5年内
What kind of loser gets set up

311
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,450
被陷害参与了两桩举世瞩目的刺杀案呢
For two high-profile assassinations within five years?

312
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,320
林肯  这不是你的错
Linc,this is not your fault.

313
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,960
如果他们当时没得逞的话
If they didn't get away with it then,

314
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,130
他们现在也休想办到
They're not gonna get away with it now.

315
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,010
但是我需要你集中精神
But I need you to focus.

316
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,630
我需要你的帮忙  林肯
I need your help, Linc.

317
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,070
没错  我们走
Right. Let's get out of here.

318
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,700
达林・胡克斯  国土安全局
Darrin Hooks, Homeland Security.

319
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,900
能带我去见你们的主管吗
Can you point me to whoever's in charge here?

320
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,820
国土安全局  你们要派多少人过来啊
Homeland? How many of you guys are they sending here?

321
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,400
赛尔夫探员已经进去了
Agent Self's already inside.

322
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,690
谁
Who?

323
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,190
当・赛尔夫探员
Agent Don Self.

324
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,160
刚刚到这儿了不久
Got here a little while ago.

325
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,370
我是胡克斯
Yeah, it's Hooks.

326
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,390
那个应该在洛杉矶死了的探员的名字
The name of that agent that was supposedly killed recently in L.A.?

327
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,640
是不是  当・赛尔夫
Was his name Don Self?

328
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,090
一切都正中克里斯蒂娜下怀
It's all falling out exactly as Christina planned it.

329
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:15,970
现在她就要得偿所愿了
Now she's going to have everything she ever hoped for.

330
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,430
她想重燃1962年中印边境之战的战火
She's trying to reignite the 1962 China-India Border War

331
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,180
那次冲突好不容易才和解
Which ended in an uneasy truce

332
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,270
那时两国在边远荒芜的山区相持不下
When neither country could withstand the losses

333
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,990
直到双方两败俱伤才罢休
They were sustaining in those remote and desolate mountains.

334
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,900
如果她成功煽动了另一场战争
If she succeeds in provoking another war,

335
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,610
诬陷是中国方面
And framing China

336
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,240
刺杀了印度总理的儿子
For the killing of India's Prime Minister's son,

337
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
那就绝对足够有煽动性的了
It's certainly provocation enough.

338
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,580
她会引发一场会持续数十年的军事冲突
She'll set off a military conflict that will last for decades

339
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,990
有可能永无宁日了
That may never be resolved.

340
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,500
你为什么不自己干
Why didn't you do it yourself?

341
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,620
权力  金钱  似乎是你钟爱的东西
Power, money, seem to be things you love.

342
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,010
因为如果印度牵涉进来  巴基斯坦也会
Because if India's involved, that drags in Pakistan.

343
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,100
然后俄罗斯就要开始防御它的边境了
Then Russia's gonna want to defend its borders.

344
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,520
然后不到一年  整个欧洲都牵扯其中
Then within a year, Europe's in it

345
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,970
接着就是美国
And after that, the United States.

346
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,690
这是一场同归于尽的灾难
It's an apocalypse in which everyone loses!

347
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,170
克里斯蒂娜一直都太自傲
And Christina has always been too prideful

348
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,360
太反复无常  不愿接受这个事实
And too unstable to accept that.

349
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,440
明白了
Got it.

350
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,010
需要帮忙吗
Can I help you?

351
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,980
你好  我想你能帮忙
Hi. Yes, I think you can.

352
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,080
赛尔夫探员
Agent Self.

353
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,530
唐纳德・赛尔夫
Donald Self?

354
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,310
我是达林・胡克斯探员
Agent Darrin Hooks.

355
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,520
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

356
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,220
也很高兴见到你
It's good to see you, too.

357
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,700
站住  别动  别动
Hold it. Hold it right there. Don't move.

358
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,620
你到底在做什么  胡克斯
What the hell are you doing, Hooks?

359
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,290
你总要自相残杀吗
You always pull guns on fellow agents?

360
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,080
对  当一个应该已上西天了的探员
Yeah, when agents that are supposedly dead

361
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,450
和杀他的人出现在同一家宾馆的时候
And are found later in a hotel

362
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,910
我就会那么干
With the guys who kill you

363
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,400
能告诉我你和布鲁斯还有斯科菲尔德
You mind telling me what you're doing here

364
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,620
在这里干吗
With Burrows and Scofield?

365
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,020
我的身份不能暴露
My cover called for me

366
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,710
只能装死  明白吗
To be dead, okay?

367
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,230
人们会理解我们的所作所为的
People were catching on to what we were doing,

368
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,320
我的死让我得以金蝉脱壳
And my death freed me up

369
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,560
但布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德是被陷害的  明白吗
But Burrows and Scofield have been set up, okay?

370
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,140
没有记录显示你在执行秘密任务
There's no record of you in covert ops.

371
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,730
就是这么安排好的
That was by design.

372
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,980
等一切结束了  我们再联系总部
Look, when this is all over, we'll call the home office,

373
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,260
我会输入我的许可代码
I'll punch in my clearance code,

374
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,320
你可以请我喝两杯
You can buy me a couple of drinks,

375
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,850
我俩再分享一下其中的乐趣
And we'll share some laughs about this.

376
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,470
但现在我得完成我的任务
But right now I need to do my damn job.

377
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,110
不行
No.

378
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,970
你跟我走
You're gonna follow

379
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,440
我们现在就把事情弄清楚
And we're gonna clear this up right now.

380
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,950
好  但斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯的事是真的
Okay, but what I said about Scofield and Burrows is true.

381
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,170
他们是被陷害的
They've been set up.

382
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,500
你得调查清楚这件事
You need to look into this.

383
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,170
等我们出去之后
Oh, I'm gonna look into everything

384
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,670
我会把一切都调查清楚
As soon as we get outside.

385
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,120
我们走
Let's go.

386
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,390
你搞定装卸口了吗
Did you clear the loading dock doors?

387
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,990
没有  但是有人做了
No, but someone else did.

388
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,910
什么意思
What do you mean?

389
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,160
有人杀死了警卫
Someone must have taken him out.

390
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,580
也就是说酒店里除了警察
Which means there's someone in the hotel

391
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,500
还有其他人在找你们
Other than the police that's looking for you.

392
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,000
林肯
Linc,

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
我们得走了
We got to move.

394
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,710
不止有警察在追我们了
Got more than just the cops after us now.

395
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,040
你知道自己在干什么吗
Whoa, whoa. You know what you're doing?

396
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,710
不知道
No.

397
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,400
我们走
Let's go.

398
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,390
哈钦森队长
Captain Hutchinson!

399
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,770
有间房门被打开了16楼
We've got a room breach on 16.

400
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,590
我是哈钦森
This is Hutchinson.

401
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,930
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯在16楼
Scofield and Burrows are on 16.

402
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,530
重复  斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯在16楼
I repeat, Scofield and Burrows are on 16.

403
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,400
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

404
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,870
上  上  上
Move, move, move!

405
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,910
这边
This way.

406
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,630
确保门能关紧
Make sure the door can shut.

407
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,180
我们需要足够的压力
We need the pressure to build.

408
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,030
他们来了  他们上来了
They're coming. They're coming!

409
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,580
到达16楼
We're on 16.

410
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,840
收到
Copy that.

411
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,420
听我命令
On my mark.

412
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,560
冲
Go.

413
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,250
赶紧增援
Backup detail!

414
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,880
行动  快  快  快
Move! go, go, go, go!

415
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,720
上  上  上  快点
Move, move, move! go, move!

416
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,670
上  上
Move, move!

417
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,040
发生什么事了
What the hell happened?

418
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,390
他们设了陷阱
They booby-trapped us.

419
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,890
他们上了天台
They made a move for the roof.

420
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,510
好的  带他们去医院
All right, get them to a hospital.

421
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,450
好的  我们走  快  快  快
All right. Let's go! Move, move, move!

422
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,280
站住别动
Stop right there!

423
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,340
布鲁斯  休想动手拿枪
Don't make a move for that weapon, Burrows.

424
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,740
把面罩摘了
Take the masks off.

425
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,980
立刻摘了
Take them off now!

426
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,550
手放到脑后
Hands behind your head.

427
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,340
你们最好祈祷
You'd better pray to god that

428
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,300
我的手下没有出事
My men are found out all right.

429
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,750
不过是个冲击波
It was a concussive blast.

430
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,100
他们只是失去知觉了
They're just unconscious.

431
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,020
闭嘴
Shut up.

432
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,110
放松
Easy!

433
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,110
放松
Easy.

434
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,110
就像他刚说的那样  别想动手拿枪
And I'd follow that advice about not going for your guns.

435
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,090
将军要你们回他办公室一趟
The general would like you back at the office.

436
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,240
就现在
Now.

437
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,900
酒店的事进展顺利吗
Did all go well at the hotel?

438
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,620
我妈妈和莎拉怎么样
What's going on with Sara and my mother?

439
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,210
克里斯蒂娜逃走了
Christina escaped.

440
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,570
莎拉没事
Sara's okay.

441
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,210
她还在公寓里
She's in the condo.

442
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,100
打扰一下  你俩是不是想单独聚一聚
Excuse me, would you boys like a little alone time to catch up?

443
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,050
你究竟想要我们做什么
What exactly do you expect from us?

444
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,270
你们得为自己的过失负责
You need to take responsibility for your failures.

445
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,050
我们没有失手
Hey, we failed nothing.

446
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,250
整件事都是个圈套
This whole thing was a setup.

447
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,890
-你明知道  -林肯・布鲁斯果然聪明
- You know it.  - Lincoln Burrows was outsmarted.

448
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,560
谁能料想到那是陷阱呢
Who could have anticipated that?

449
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,070
你得面对现实  一切都已经结束了
I think you need to accept that this is over.

450
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,960
我手上的筹码握得太久了
I've been holding a chip for far too long.

451
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,180
是时候出手了
It's time to play it.

452
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,630
我们有过君子协议
I made you boys a promise.

453
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,300
你们找回锡拉
You would find Scylla

454
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,450
我给你们一笔钱
And I would see to it you got some cash

455
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,810
并毁掉那份名单
And had the slate wiped clean.

456
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,640
我仍想遵守协议
I intend to keep that promise.

457
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,600
然而  如果遵守了一项协议
However, if I keep one promise,

458
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,730
所有的协议都得遵守
I have to keep them all.

459
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,800
现在
Now...

460
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,650
我想看看
I wonder

461
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,820
谁才是那个大赢家
Who the big winner will be.

462
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,940
-别这么做  -别做什么
- Don't do this.  - Don't do what?

463
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,650
我寄信给你们的时候
When I sent you those envelopes,

464
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,190
并不是跟你们开玩笑
I wasn't just playing games

465
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
我说得很清楚
I made it very clear

466
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
你们只有一天时间
That you had one day

467
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,780
来完成任务
To accomplish your job,

468
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,670
否则后果自负
Or there would be consequences.

469
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,990
那是什么
What's that?

470
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,540
后果
The consequence.

471
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,260
打电话给我们王后区的手下
Call our man in Queens.

472
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,160
王后区  你打电话到纽约干什么
Queens? What are you calling New York for?

473
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,930
麻烦打开免提
Put it on speaker, please.

474
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,380
-请讲  -对4号目标采取行动
- Yes. - Move on Subject Four.

475
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,550
我就一条街的距离
I'm a block away.

476
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,840
预计两分钟内到达
ETA is less than two minutes.

477
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,150
你个王八蛋
You son of a bitch.

478
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,060
你个王八蛋
You son of a bitch!

479
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,010
我老婆只是个手无缚鸡之力的女人
My wife is a defenseless woman.

480
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,150
赛尔夫先生没有透露过他有个老婆  是吧
Mr. Self didn't inform you that he had a wife, did he?

481
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,550
换了是我  也不会说的
Well, I wouldn't talk about my wife either

482
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,900
要是我有点喝高了  酒后驾车
if I'd had a few too many Bourbons, got behind the wheel,

483
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,520
不小心就把个绝代佳人碾成了花椰菜
And turned a beautiful young woman into a piece of broccoli.

484
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,540
别伤害她
Don't do anything.

485
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,080
我猜那才是你要携带锡拉潜逃的原因
I assume that is why you tried to run away with Scylla?

486
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,490
辜负了一个福利只够支付你
To screw a government that was giving you benefits

487
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,430
一个小县城环城高速监管费的政府
that would only pay for a county facility overlooking the belt parkway,

488
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,720
你转手卖了锡拉  你和她就可以从此消失
and to sell it so that you and she could disappear

489
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,310
改头换面  永远逍遥快活了
And be hidden forever.

490
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,010
这就是生活[法语]
C'est la vie.

491
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,180
我看到目标了
I have the subject in sights.

492
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,370
她在医院的院子里坐在轮椅上
She's in a wheelchair under a tree in the hospital courtyard.

493
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,160
可以动手了吗
Do I have a go?

494
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,180
求求你别伤害她
Please don't do this.

495
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,180
求你了  你们可以杀我  你们杀我吧
Okay, please, you can kill me, okay, you can kill me

496
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,940
现在就行  求你了  杀我吧
Right now, please, kill me.

497
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,070
你没必要这样  我们会拿到锡拉的
You don't need to do this. We'll get Scylla.

498
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,270
那才是我想听的答案
That's what I wanted to hear.

499
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,390
那是我们正在做的
Well that's what we'r trying to do

500
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,280
-我们快找到了  -但你们必须知道
- We're getting it. - But you have to know what awaits you

501
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,780
如果失败  等待你们和自己爱人的下场
And your loved ones if you don't.

502
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,060
我们都明白
We understand, okay?

503
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,580
-执行命令  -求求你别这样
- Execute the order. - Please don't do it!

504
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,090
天哪
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

505
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,640
救命  救命
Get help, hel--!

506
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,510
我想你刚才请求了死刑
I believe you made a request.

507
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,410
蒂博格  确保他死定了
Bagwell, make sure he's dead.

508
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,210
大家现在都明白了吗
Does everyone understand now?

509
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,420
我们现在可以同心协力了吗
Are we all on the same page?

510
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,120
很好
Good.

511
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,760
开工了  开工了
Let's get down to business.

512
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,630
7.5亿美元
Three-quarters of a billion dollars

513
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,470
在卢森堡  用的是匿名账户
In a numerical account in Luxembourg.

514
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,690
如果你还关心慈善工作的话
If you are still worried about humanitarian efforts,

515
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,710
给联合国儿童基金会写张支票
Write a check to UNICEF.

516
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,830
24小时内所有数据就会送到
All the data will be delivered within 24 hours.

517
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,880
正合我意
That's what I expected.

518
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,700
你的计划非常成功
You played it perfectly.

519
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,300
联系下我们在中国的联系人
Reach out to our contact in China.

520
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,070
我感觉他们可能也会对我们的货很感兴趣
I have a feeling they may be interested in what we're selling as well.

521
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
克里斯蒂娜  我不建议
Christina, I don't advise

522
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,640
脚踩两只船
Playing both sides of this coin.

523
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,140
瘦猪有食吃
Pigs get fat

524
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,310
肥猪一刀死
And hogs get slaughtered.

525
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,500
去联系中国的联系人
Reach out to China.

526
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,000
不  让我们的人
No! Keep our people

527
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,890
守好佛罗里达和乔治亚州的每个私人机场
At every private airfield in Florida and in Georgia.

528
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,090
我们不能让克里斯蒂娜离开这个州
We can't have Christina leaving the state.

529
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,930
她在玩弄印度人的感情
She played on India's emotions,

530
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,230
可能说明她想在今天与
Which probably means she'd want to meet

531
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,880
其中一个大使会面
With one of their emissaries today

532
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,900
趁自己还很受欢迎
While they're still running hot.

533
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,380
她可能还在迈阿密
She could still be in Miami,

534
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,430
或许就在大使馆里
Maybe at the embassy.

535
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,050
不  她不会在大使馆的
No. She's not at the embassy.

536
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,390
她和印度做的任何交易
Any deal she makes with India

537
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,600
都会绝对地保密
Will be strictly off the radar.

538
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,360
现在她关心的只有2件事
Right now she's concerned with two things.

539
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
一件是将锡拉卖出去
One is closing the deal on Scylla,

540
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,390
我先假定她已经完成了
Which I'm assuming she's already done,

541
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,160
第二件事就是拿到钱
And the second is getting paid.

542
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,710
没有赛尔夫的踪迹
No sign of Self.

543
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,730
卖掉锡拉她能拿到多少钱
How much can she get for Scylla?

544
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,740
印度的5亿美金  还有中国的5亿
Half a billion from India, the same from China.

545
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,750
海外账户
Overseas account?

546
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,070
国外电汇吗
Foreign wire transfer?

547
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,290
我怀疑她不会收普通支票
I doubt she's taking any food stamps.

548
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,260
她会确认
She's going to want confirmation

549
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,800
在她离开美国之前
That that money is safely overseas

550
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,380
那些钱在海外账户是安全的
Before she leaves the U.S.

551
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,420
我们找到那些钱
We find the money,

552
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,600
我们就找到了我母亲
We find my mother.

553
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,300
通常国际电汇的结算
Normally it takes three business days

554
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,970
需要三个工作日
For an international wire transfer to clear,

555
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,890
除非是一家美联储授权的银行
Unless the bank is a Federal Reserve Signatory, in which case

556
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,310
那样的话转账会立即生效
The transfer is immediate.

557
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,900
你觉得她会亲自去银行吗
You think she'll head to the bank?

558
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,230
她只要从买家已经从海外转账过来的
All she has to do is withdraw a few grand from the millions

559
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,420
上百万美元里面取出几千块
That that buyer has probably transferred overseas already.

560
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,240
她就知道了钱全到账了
She'll know it's all there.

561
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,160
那么只要我们找到一家美联储授权的
So let's find a Federal Reserve Signatory bank in Miami.

562
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,610
迈阿密银行  我们就有机会找到她
We'll have a shot at finding her.

563
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,380
还有锡拉
And Scylla.

564
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,880
你瞧  迈克尔  这就是
There, Michael, you see, that's

565
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,280
为什么我刚才没有把你的名字放在碗里
Why I didn't put your name in the bowl.

566
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,140
你是这里唯一无法取代的人
You're the only one here that's irreplaceable.

567
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,850
探员  线人  打手
Agents, informants, muscle--

568
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,620
他们都可胜任  但是...
They're nice to have, but...

569
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,810
他们都是可以取代的
Finally they're replaceable.

570
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,590
附近有家支行  大概20分钟的路程
There's a branch about 20 minutes away.

571
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,230
你的头脑
That mind of yours--

572
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,430
简直是百万里挑一的
It's one in a million.

573
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,630
很高兴看到它终于为我所用了
Nice to see it finally working for me.

574
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,600
我不是为你干的
I do not work for you.

575
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,940
走着瞧
Not yet.

576
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,340
是合法的
It's legitimate,

577
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,350
我向你保证
I assure you.

578
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,430
好的
Oh, okay.

579
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,830
我想取回10000美元现金
I just want to withdraw the $10,000

580
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,720
以确定卢森堡账户是否已准确无误地建好
So I can be sure the Luxembourg account is properly set up.

581
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,470
当然
Of course.

582
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,410
她在里面吗
Is she in there?

583
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,080
是  我从窗子那看见她
Yeah, I saw her through the window.

584
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,380
正和一个高个的黑发男子说话
She's talking to a tall, dark-haired guy.

585
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,700
他们就是在酒店里面陷害我们的人
They're the same guys who set us up at the hotel.

586
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,310
我们等她出来  杀他们个措手不及
We wait until she comes out, just jump them.

587
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,300
那么  我们怎么对付她的保镖呢
So... What do we do about her security?

588
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,010
要想对付她  得先搞定她的保镖
I mean, we jump her, we gotta jump the guys she's with,

589
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,740
天知道  还会有多少探员会像蚂蚁一样
And God knows how many other agents are gonna come crawling

590
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,700
从门外冲进来
Out of the woodwork like ants.

591
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,270
听着  我不想说得这么直白
Look, um... I hate to bring up the obvious,

592
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,100
但是我记得上次  你们俩依然对
But last time I checked, you two still disagreed

593
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,370
锡拉到手后如何处置  各有打算
As to what to do with Scylla If we actually get it.

594
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,030
是啊  我猜就是这样
Yeah, that's what I thought.

595
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,360
别说这烂事了
Well, let's skip the damn thing.

596
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,580
我是说  谁能拦住我们
I mean, who's gonna stop us?

597
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,810
就凭一个17岁的小保安弟弟吗
A 17-year-old security guard?

598
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,830
不是  可能是那个拿枪的家伙
No, probably the guy with the gun.

599
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,140
他一看到我们的脸就会开火
He'll open fire as soon as he sees our faces.

600
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,810
那么  或许可以不让他们看到我们的脸
Then, uh... maybe they shouldn't see our faces.

601
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,460
然后送披萨的来了
So then the pizza guy showed up,

602
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,130
然后韦恩从树丛里跳出来
And Wayne jumped out of the bushes

603
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,880
想要把披萨抢过去  但是...
And tried to grab the pizza, but the...

604
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,800
但是那个家伙...
But the guy...

605
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,190
我的天啊
My god.

606
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,730
你还好吗  先生
Are you okay, Mister?

607
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,310
没事
Yeah.

608
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,450
去打911
Go call 911.

609
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,870
-快去  -别去
- Go, go. - No.

610
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,900
别去  别打给任何人
No, don't call anyone.

611
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
行吗
Okay?

612
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,820
别打给任何人
Don't call anybody.

613
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,740
别打给任何人
Don't call anyone.

614
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,620
你知道吗  一旦那个弟弟拿到了
You know, once baby brother's got his little hands

615
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,950
你的"魔法盒子"
On that magic box of yours,

616
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,620
他要是想骗过马吉拉大猩猩[指代将军]
I don't think it's going to be too hard for him

617
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,870
简直就是易如反掌
To trick Magilla Gorilla,

618
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,170
你知道我是什么意思吧
If you know what I'm saying.

619
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,260
不  我不知道
No, I don't.

620
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,590
你还真以为
And you really think

621
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,010
斯科菲尔德会不顾他侄子的安危
That Scofield's going to risk his nephew's life?

622
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,010
他把"头等奖"交给"坏人"之前
He's gonna figure out something

623
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,400
肯定会想出点别的坏点子来的
Before he hands first prize over to the bad guys.

624
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,070
斯科菲尔德想得很单纯  就像童子军
Scofield thinks pure, like a little cub scout.

625
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,050
布鲁斯  他的思维也很幼稚
Burrows, he just thinks like a cub.

626
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,600
他说得对
He's right.

627
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,270
斯科菲尔德在外面拿着我想要的东西
I don't feel comfortable having Scofield

628
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,610
而我困在这却没有他的把柄
Out there with something I want

629
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,940
我可不放心
While I'm stuck here with nothing he wants.

630
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,610
我需要筹码
I need leverage.

631
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,910
你看见他们刚过来的时候
You saw the way Mahone pulled Scofield over

632
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
马宏把他拉到一边去了吧
When they first got here.

633
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,250
我打赌他们说的肯定是关于
Bet you a wooden nickel they was talking

634
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:20,670
女医生和她的藏身之处
About little Dr. Underpants and her whereabouts.

635
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,840
但是我们不知道在什么地方
Too bad we don't know where that is.

636
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,680
又错了  卷发小子
Wrong again, curly.

637
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,180
你们都在这嚼口香糖的时候
While everyone was up here flapping their gums,

638
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,550
我擅自跑去了马宏的车上
I took the liberty of toddling down to Mahone's car,

639
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,320
查了他GPS上的最近输入的一个地址
Checking out the last address he put in his GPS.

640
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,440
还有一线希望  找到你想要的筹码
There's a gambler's chance we might find the leverage

641
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,610
就在这个地方
You're looking for right here.

642
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,690
我去办
I'm on it.

643
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,330
不
No.

644
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,750
你想参与行动
You wanted to get in on the action,

645
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,690
机会来了
Here's your chance.

646
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,810
好的  我再帮您点一下
Okay, I'll just count this out for you.

647
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,900
没这个必要
That won't be necessary.

648
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,980
那好吧
All righty.

649
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,480
这是您交易记录的打印凭条
Here's a printed record of your transaction,

650
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,730
我想您的余额还有这么多
And I think a balance that high,

651
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,820
您确定不想和我们的投资顾问谈一谈吗
Are you sure you don't want to talk to one of our investment specialists?

652
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,870
不  谢谢
No, thank you.

653
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,280
所有人  趴下
Everybody down on the ground!

654
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,080
快点  都别动  没人会受伤
Now! Nobody move, Nobody gets hurt.

655
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,210
你  趴下
You, down.

656
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,660
天啊  邪门了
Thanks. What are the odds?

657
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,260
别
Don't.

658
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,380
箱子
The case.

659
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,220
我来拿
I'll take that.

660
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,660
你好  老妈
Hi, mom.

661
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,930
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯正从银行出来
Scofield and Burrows leaving the bank, now!

662
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,810
快跑
Go!

663
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,480
拿着锡拉快跑
Take Scylla and go!

664
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,560
我们一起走
We gotta stay together!

665
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,390
说了  快走
I said go!

666
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,030
快
Come on!

667
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,840
他好像没子弹了
I think he's out.

668
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,880
上
Move in.

669
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,350
上
Move in.

670
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,770
美国司法系统一开始为无罪释放
How much eggs does the U.S. court system  have on its face

671
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,010
林肯・布鲁斯  花了多大功夫呢
for exonerating Lincoln Burrows in the first place?

672
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,910
功夫不到位  宝拉
An omelet's worth, Paula.

673
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,300
你应该记得我从不赞成无罪释放
If you remember I was never in favor of the exoneration.

674
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,430
林肯・布鲁斯是个给人卖命的暴徒
Lincoln Burrows is a thug for hire,

675
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,840
他弟弟也不是省油的灯
And his little brother is no better.

676
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,610
我惊讶于司法系统就这么忽略了警告
I'm amazed that the court system just glossed over the warning signs.

677
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,980
-举个例子吧  -第一
- Such as?  - For one,

678
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,480
他们绝不该把布鲁斯和斯科菲尔德搅和进来
They should've never let Burrows and Scofield in

679
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,540
他们应该看看斯科菲尔德的过去
They should've looked at Scofield's past.

680
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,290
显然他没有犯罪记录
It's clear that he had no criminal background.

681
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:36,660
一个杰出的结构工程师干嘛去抢银行
Why would a brilliant structural engineer rob a bank?

682
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,190
也许是要还清他的助学贷款
Maybe he needed to pay off his student loans.

683
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,360
不是钱的原因
It wasn't about the money.

684
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,920
你觉得司法系统
What do you think the judicial system

685
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,170
会从这件事中学到什么
Is going to learn from all this?

686
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,500
法院应该敲响警钟了
This has been a huge wake-up call for the courts.

687
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,670
法官们要搞清楚他生活中的整个关系网
Judges will have to look all the relationships in his life...

688
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
放松  小医生  放松
Easy now, doc, easy.

689
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
只不过是你友好的邻居蒂博格
It's just your friendly, neighborhood T-Bag.

690
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,310
我现在需要你的合作
Now I'm gonna need your cooperation.

691
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,860
把你那双脏手拿开
Get your hands off me,

692
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,090
婊子...
You son of a...

693
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,780
托你男友的福  我就一只手
Not hands, thanks to your boyfriend.

694
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,260
刚才说过了
Now, as I was saying before,

695
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,560
我需要你的合作
I just need your cooperation.

696
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,380
到这里来
Come in here.

697
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,560
没事了
All right.

698
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,450
没事了
All right.

699
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,450
他太慢了
He's taking too long.

700
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,460
出事了
Something's wrong.

701
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,970
我们要回去找他
We gotta go back for him.

702
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,500
他说他会赶上来的
He said he'd catch up.

703
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,060
不对  出事了
No, something's wrong.

704
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,980
打给他
Call him.

705
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,100
打给他
Call him.

706
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,740
迈克尔
Michael,

707
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,020
我们现在得到它了
Now that we have this,

708
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,830
要怎么处理它呢
What the hell are we going to do with it?

709
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,390
他不接
He's not answering.

710
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,420
林肯
Linc?

711
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,090
我在广播里听说了银行抢劫事件
I heard about the bank robbery on the radio.

712
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,680
你们兄弟俩可真喜欢上镜头啊
You boys just can't stand to be out of the news, can you?

713
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,520
我猜你们拿到锡拉了吧
I assume you've got Scylla?

714
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,020
快了
We're getting close.

715
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,500
有消息会通知你
We'll keep you posted.

716
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,810
如果我是你  现在不会挂电话  小子
I wouldn't hang up just yet if I were you, son.

717
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,740
迈克尔  我们在公寓里
Michael, we're in the apartment.

718
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,800
我知道它在你手上
I know you have it.

719
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,980
不然  克里斯蒂娜也不会冒险公然火拼
Otherwise, Christina would never have risked a public shootout.

720
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,370
现在 事情很简单
Now, I'm going to make this easy for you,

721
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,870
把锡拉给我
Bring me Scylla,

722
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,380
不然的话  莎拉这回就真的要上西天了
Or this time, Sara's death will not be faked.

723
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,720
怎么回事
What is it?

724
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,060
怎么回事
What is it?

725
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,560
莎拉在将军手上
The General has Sarah.

726
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,510
拿去吧
Take it.

727
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,740
我发誓  如果你敢动她一根汗毛
I swear if you touch her...

728
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,530
你好  儿子
Hello, son.

729
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,570
我想你有件我想要的东西
I believe you have something I want.

730
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,170
而我也有你想要的东西
And I have something you want--

731
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,420
尽管我无法理解其中原因
Although I'll never really understand why.

732
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,710
好吧
All right,

733
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,010
也许我们能想出什么办法
Maybe we can work something out.

734
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:17,050
我给过你机会想办法
I gave you the opportunity to work something out.

735
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,430
是你拒绝了我  迈克尔
You rejected me, Michael.

736
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,070
听着  我们见面谈吧
Look, let's meet and talk about this.

737
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,070
没门  谈话的机会
No, the time for talking

738
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,550
在你套上滑雪面具的那一刻就没有了
Passed about the time you put those ski masks on,

739
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,340
不是吗
Don't you think?

740
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,910
迈克尔  现在我要做的是
So, here's what I'm going to do, Michael.

741
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:33,330
对林肯的右胸腔开枪
I'm going to shoot Lincoln through the right rib cage,

742
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:36,700
子弹就擦过他右肺的下面
Just grazing the lower quadrant of his right lung.

743
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,200
右肺会慢慢地衰竭
It will slowly collapse,

744
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,670
呼吸会非常困难
Making it very difficult to breathe.

745
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,670
如果5小时内  他不接受治疗
If he doesn't get medical attention, within five hours,

746
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,170
就必死无疑
He'll be dead.

747
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,380
克里斯蒂娜  妈妈  别
Christina... mom... please

748
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,150
林肯
Linc!

749
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,380
时间不多了  迈克尔
Second hand's spinning, Michael.

750
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,690
看来你该做抉择了
Looks like you have a little decision to make.

751
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,030
要锡拉
Scylla

752
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,160
还是要你爱的人
Or someone you love.
