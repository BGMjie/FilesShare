Previously on Prison Break.

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,060
这些是踝部GPS监视器
These are GPS ankle monitors.

4
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,300
大家都过来  每个人都戴上一个
Now,step up,take one and put it on.

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,000
交换人质结束后
When the exchange is over,

6
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,300
我和你要好好的算一下帐
you and I are gonna spend some quality time.

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,660
这些不是释放文件
These aren't release papers.

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,260
我尽了全力了
I did the best I could do.

9
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,700
你只有签了名  我才能拿到罗兰的仪器
You need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device.

10
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,200
你想让我放弃
You want me to give up the one thing

11
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,330
我在这个小组中唯一存在的价值
that makes me valuable to the team.

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,660
你清楚你入伙的时候  我们的君子协定
Hey,you knew the deal when you came onboard.

13
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,060
你以为  你走错一步
Do you want to flush it down the toilet

14
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,360
你还能拍拍屁股走人吗
because you made a bad move?

15
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,730
这个人刚刚继承了10万美金的遗产
This man just came into a $100,000 inheritance.

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,300
我不认识他
I don't recognize him.

17
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,330
如果你见到他  可以给我们打个电话吗
If you do see him,would you please give us a call?

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,000
你不在税务局工作
You don't work for the IRS?

19
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,630
我不在
I don't.

20
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,660
你为谁卖命
Who do you work for?

21
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,760
现在  我只为我自己
As of now... myself.

22
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,860
我是克兰兹将军的助手
I'm an associate of General Krantz.

23
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,200
将军喜欢保留自己的隐私
The general,he likes his privacy.

24
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,760
我开始就知道你不是个正经的销售员
I knew you were rotten from the beginning,

25
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,530
我要你彻底交代清楚
so I want you to walk me through this

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,560
如果你说不清楚  我就向当局报告
and if you can't,I'm gonna call the authorities.

27
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,530
科尔・普发
Cole Pfeiffer.

28
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,400
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

29
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,130
上一次
The last time

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,930
一个像你一样的小姑娘
a pretty little filly like yourself

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,460
把我打晕还五花大绑在椅子上
knocked me senseless and tied me to a chair,

32
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,060
我是付了钱给她的
I had to pay for it.

33
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,400
这次你或许也可以故技重演啊
You still might.

34
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,560
那本书是我一个最亲近的朋友
That book was a gift

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,130
送给我的礼物
from a very dear friend of mine

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,830
他很突然地就去世了
who left this realm all too soon.

37
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,660
詹姆斯・惠斯勒只会给别人
The only thing that James Whistler ever gave anybody

38
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,960
送去淋病
was the clap.

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,130
你有30秒时间告诉我
You have 30 seconds to tell me something

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
一些我不知道的事情
that I don't already know.

41
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,960
我和詹姆斯・惠斯勒关在巴拿马的时候
I followed that book from Panama City,

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,630
就一直留意这本书  根据书的内容
where James Whistler and I were co-incarcerated,

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,560
我找到了一个在圣地亚哥车站的柜子
to a bus locker in San Diego.

44
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,100
在里面有关于这栋公寓
Inside was information pertaining to this apartment...

45
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,900
是锡拉
Scylla.

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,100
怎么样
How about that?

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,460
听起来很熟悉吧
That ring a bell,huh? Huh?

48
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,430
你知道多少关于锡拉的事情
What do you know about Scylla?

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,900
我只知道我是最关键的人物
I know I'm holding the keys,

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,900
没有我  那本书
because without me,that bird book's

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,200
连一点意义都没有
about as meaningful as a fart in a wind storm.

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,530
我使用了惠斯勒的化名
I commandeered Whistler's alias.

53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,800
我混进了他工作的地方
I infiltrated his place of business

54
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,060
因为那是揭开所有谜团的钥匙
because it's the gateway to the whole damn thing.

55
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,400
地点在哪
Where's the location?

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,600
你怎么着也得给我点好处甜头吧
What do you bring to the jamboree,darling,huh?

57
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,060
除了蓝色的小上衣
Aside from those baby blues

58
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,830
和一把刀
and a knife?

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,630
这是我
This is me.

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,900
这是锡拉
This is Scylla.

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,960
这是你
This is you.

62
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,330
我一定会得到锡拉
I am gonna get Scylla.

63
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,000
区别只是那时你可能还活着
And it can either be with you...

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,330
也可能已经死翘翘了
...or through you.

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,500
所以  为什么你不能
So why don't you give me

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,530
在我割下你的睾丸前
that informed decision right now,

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,730
告诉我你考虑后的答案呢
before I spill your hillbilly guts all over the carpet?

68
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,660
你别想和我耍花样
'Cause you're messing with the wrong bitch.

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,930
我能为你做些什么呢
How may I be of service?

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,960
真不敢相信
This is unbelievable.

71
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,360
我们还在考虑怎么跟踪斯库得利
We were planning our move

72
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,530
-他竟然包了整架飞机  -对
on Scuderi when he chartered the flight. Right.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,400
而且你不能先一步知道
And no chance you dragged your feet a little bit

74
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,860
斯库得利包了整架飞机
waiting for Scuderi to charter the flight?

75
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,530
对  我们故意晚了一步
Oh,yeah,we want to drag this out.

76
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,460
地点不错  你觉得呢　林肯
Yeah,well,location's pretty convenient,wouldn't you say,Linc?

77
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,300
既然斯库得利出城了
Uh,Scuderi splitting town

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,100
那我们是不是可以休息一下了
kind of caught us a break,huh?

79
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,730
你能不能让他闭嘴
Would you shut him up?

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,300
别这样对我
No,no.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,300
我们不能就这样等他回来
SELF: We could just wait till he comes back.

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,060
昂格里逊公司制造农业用化学物质
AgriSow makes farm chemicals.

83
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,100
又不是军事基地
It's not Fort Knox.

84
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,200
你敢打赌吗
You want to bet?

85
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,930
他们的专利价值上亿
Their patents are worth billions.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,430
所以很多公司都对这些专利
Which is why companies tend to keep a very close eye

87
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,760
非常关注
on those patents.

88
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,400
我们在一个星期内
Yeah,we could breach their security,

89
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,560
可以突破他们的保安系统  我们也可以
in a week,minimum. We could get

90
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,300
在一个星期内进入他的房子
in the guy's house-- week,minimum.

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,400
或者跟踪他12个小时
Or we could follow the guys for 12 hours out of town

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,300
在午夜之前得到第五张卡  你觉得怎么样
and have card five by midnight. How's that sound?

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,830
你们觉得这个主意如何
How does this sound?

94
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,260
如果你们半夜之前回不来  全都给我蹲大狱
If you're not back by midnight you're going to jail.

95
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,560
你以为我不知道
Yeah,don't I know it.

96
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,630
我们出去谈谈
Let's talk outside.

97
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
那我们该怎么打算呢
So what's the plan?

98
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,060
我们去拉斯维加斯
We're going to Vegas.

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
好极了
Oh,hell yes!

100
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,100
我要霰弹枪
Yo,I call shotgun!

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,330
你们谁有...
Huh? Who's got-- Hey.

102
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,300
你想和我谈什么  赛尔夫探员
So what do you want to talk about,Agent Self?

103
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,560
到现在 我已经参与了
I've been a part of hundreds

104
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,360
不下于几百次的行动了
of operations during my career--

105
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,730
我告诉你一件事
and I'll tell you one thing.

106
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,700
我从来没有被人列为第一追杀目标
I never been on the top of someone else's hit list.

107
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,460
-你什么意思  -我什么意思
What are you talking about? What am I talking about?

108
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,960
如果这个叫怀特的公司杀手能找到我一次
If this Company hit man Wyatt

109
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,960
那他下次突然出现在我车后面
can find me once,it's only a matter of time

110
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,400
只不过是时间问题
until he creeps up in the back of my rearview mirror again.

111
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,030
这不可能
Well,that's not true.

112
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,660
如果他要干掉你
'Cause you'll never see him coming at all

113
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,860
你不可能见他第二次
if he's coming after you. Yeah.

114
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,660
这话挺安慰我的
That's comforting.

115
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,830
你以为呢  我想你死吗
What do you think,I want that?

116
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,860
你死了 我们都得回监狱
You're dead,we're all back in jail.

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,460
你当特工的时间比我长
You were an agent longer than me.

118
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,900
我现在该如何是好呢
What's my play here?

119
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,230
我和你直说了吧  你把我留在看守所里
Let me get this straight. You turn your back

120
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,730
现在你问我你该如何是好
on me and now you want to know my play

121
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,430
那是你的错
That was your fault.

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,430
你尽职尽责了吗?
What would you have done?

123
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,330
我追踪的人都是强奸犯  杀人犯
I've tracked down rapists,killers,

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
退役军人
even former military,

125
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,000
但是一个结构工程师就把我搞定了
but a structural engineer from Illinois was able to get to me.

126
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,030
你知道为什么吗
Want to know how?

127
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,560
告诉我
Yeah,I want to know.

128
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,360
他没有逃跑
He stopped running.

129
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,260
他主动出击
He got aggressive.

130
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,900
我反倒成了他游戏的玩偶
He took the game to me.

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,260
你就该学学他的手段
That's your play.

132
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,660
你只有背水一战这条路了
That's your only play.

133
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,260
我不用提醒你  谋杀一个联邦探员
I shouldn't have to remind you that killing a federal agent

134
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,930
是非常麻烦的  就算为了工作也是一样
is a complicated matter-- even in our line of work.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,960
也许  马宏只不过是
Perhaps Mahone is just

136
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,100
冰山一角
the tip of the iceberg.

137
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,830
我们一直在搜寻
We've been searching for the link between

138
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,560
重型监狱　布伦斯和斯科菲尔德之间的联系
SuperMax and Burrows and Scofield.

139
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,630
我相信我们已经找到联系了
I believe we found it.

140
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,430
如果斯科菲尔德和布伦斯已和政府联手
If Scofield and Burrows are working with the government,

141
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,130
我们惹上的麻烦可比一个
we've got a much bigger problem

142
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,500
国土安全局的小探员更大了
than one bureaucrat at Homeland Security.

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,400
但是  是那个小探员带的头
But it begins with that bureaucrat.

144
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,500
如果当・赛尔夫是他们的头
And if Don Self is the head of the snake...

145
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,530
让他看上去是死于意外
Make it look like an accident.

146
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,400
顺便说一下  我的费用得翻一倍
My fee just doubled,by the way.

147
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,830
喂
Hello?

148
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,110
是布拉德吗
Uh,hi,is this Brad?

149
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,440
是的
Yeah.

150
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,340
几天前  你来我办公室
Uh,you came by my office a couple of days ago

151
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,570
找一个继承遗产的人
looking for a guy who had an inheritance coming to him.

152
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,270
是的
Right.

153
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,840
我知道他在哪
I know where he is.

154
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,670
她先要两千
She wants two grand first.

155
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,070
我中午和她见面
I'm meeting her at noon.

156
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,440
但是下一张卡更重要  对吧
Okay,the next card's more important,right?

157
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,370
我们先去维加斯  然后再解决蒂博格
So Vegas first,then we deal with T-Bag.

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,470
闭嘴
Shut up!

159
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,870
我留下来
I'll stay.

160
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,070
好吧
All right.

161
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,740
林肯  带着
Linc,take,uh,

162
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,410
莎拉  苏克雷
Sara and Sucre...

163
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,540
罗兰　去维加斯
...Roland to Vegas.

164
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,240
我们留下来的
The rest of us...

165
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,370
会解决蒂博格
...will handle T-Bag

166
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,770
大家都听到了  我们上路吧
You heard the man,let's go.

167
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,940
你得答应我一些事  好吗
...promise me something,would you?

168
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,010
说
Yeah.

169
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,910
你能帮我弄张俺媳妇滴照片吗
Can you get me Carrot Top's autograph?

170
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,940
我只是觉得
'Cause I just think

171
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,310
这样才能让我无怨无悔地放手去干
that would make this whole thing worthwhile.

172
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,940
多加小心
Be safe.

173
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,010
维加斯宝贝儿  我们来咯!
Ay,yo,Vegas,bitches!

174
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,310
他应该得到线索了
He should have the info by now.

175
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,970
贝里克怎么去了这么长时间
Okay,what the hell's taking Bellick so long?

176
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,210
她想要更多的钱
BELLICK: She wants more money.

177
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,470
多少钱
How much more?

178
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
我不知道
I don't know.

179
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,540
你得过来和她谈谈
You got to come talk to this chick.

180
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,170
别动
Hold on,hold on.

181
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,510
怎么了　贝里克
What's going on,Bellick?

182
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,670
面对现实吧
Believe it.

183
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,870
出什么事了 布拉德
What happened,Brad?

184
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,970
对不起  我没看出来是个圈套
Sorry,guys,I walked right into it,too.

185
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,810
没关系  动作快点
It's okay. Go. Go! Come on,now!

186
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,370
你根本不清楚你在跟谁合作  伙计
You have no idea who you're working with,honey.

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,210
只有一个了断的法子  蒂博格
There's only one way this can end,Bagwell.

188
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,440
你能不能别搞那么多花样
Why don't we skip the theatrics

189
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,010
直接告诉我们你想要什么
and you just tell us what you want.

190
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,210
我非常愿意让你头上开花
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.

191
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,740
没时间了
Time's up.

192
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,370
他也是
Him,too.

193
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,570
全部给我上车
Let's all get in the van.

194
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,970
现在 全部给我上车
Let's all get in the van now.

195
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,010
马宏  你也上去
You,too,Mahone.

196
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,410
我还记得我们初识的那一天  小白脸
I remember the day we met,Pretty.

197
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,910
你坐在长凳上
You were a scared little college boy

198
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,940
好像一个胆小如鼠的文弱书生
sittin' up on those bleachers,

199
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,440
试着不招惹麻烦
tryin' to keep your ass out of the game.

200
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,640
现在再看看你
Now look at you.

201
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,080
冷酷  无情
Cold. Hard.

202
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,710
好像一朵需要
Like a dried up flower

203
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,910
浇灌的花朵
wanting to get watered.

204
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,380
告诉我你想要什么
Just tell me what you want.

205
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,240
我想让你受尽折磨
I want to make you bleed.

206
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,180
我想让我体内被封印多年的心魔
I want to release the sinner inside of me

207
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,480
再一次苏醒
that got me incarcerated so many years ago.

208
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,910
但是  这一次
But it seems

209
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
你很走运  小白脸
you caught yourself a break,Pretty.

210
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,640
我需要你
I need you.

211
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,440
现在
Now...

212
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,410
你要乖乖地和我合作
you gonna cooperate right quick or so help me

213
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,610
否则  我会打到你站不起来
I'm gonna stomp you till you can't stand.

214
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,980
看着这几页
The pages-- look at them.

215
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,640
-看着像地图  是不是 -我不知道
Looks like some kind of map,right? I don't know.

216
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,940
你不知道的话  不可能一直
You know enough to chase me down

217
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,180
追着我到这里
looking for this.

218
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,940
别对我撒谎  小白脸
Now don't lie to me,Pretty.

219
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,140
不管书里有什么  都不是你和我能解决的问题
Whatever's in that book-- it is bigger than you and me.

220
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,540
就和锡拉一样
What,like Scylla big?

221
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,280
这不是游戏
This is not a game,Theodore.

222
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,340
你得告诉我  你一直和谁联络
Now,you need to tell me who you've been talking to.

223
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,670
我不需要听你的鬼话
I don't need to do a damn thing.

224
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,310
这就是所谓枪杆子里出政权了
That's the benefit of being the man with the gun.

225
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,140
你现在给我写下
You're going to write down everything

226
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,740
你知道所有关于锡拉的事情
you already know about Scylla,

227
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,920
还有所有你从书里看到东西
and everything you learn from that book...

228
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,380
否则  我就让墙上
...or I'm going to paint these walls

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
沾满你的脑浆
with your gray matter.

230
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
开工了!
Get to work!

231
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,780
[档案名: 康姆利集团]
The Comrie Group

232
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,440
好的  我马上就到
All right. I'll be right there.

233
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,810
赛尔夫
Self.

234
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,240
自从联系后
Hey. Michael's position

235
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,910
迈克的位置一直没变
hasn't changed since you called.

236
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,740
我们怎么知道他没有....
How do we know he...?

237
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,840
蒂博格是个神经病
Bagwell's a psychopath,

238
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,040
但是他是有计划的
but he's a psychopath with a plan.

239
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,580
很明显  他需要从迈克那里得到什么
He obviously needs something from Michael,

240
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,810
只要迈克不给他
and as long as Michael doesn't give it to him,

241
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,280
他就能活着
he'll keep breathing.

242
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,440
好吧  我和你一起去
All right. I'm coming with you.

243
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,410
不  不  我能搞定
No,no,no,no. I got it.

244
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,140
计划不变
Stick to the plan.

245
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,610
你会忘记玛丽克鲁兹吗
Will you forget about Maricruz?

246
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,180
你认为她不知道
You think she didn't know

247
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,510
她姐姐要把你供出去吗
her sister was trying to set you up,man?

248
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,010
你最好在维加斯有所斩获  兄弟
You better get some ass in Vegas,bro.

249
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,740
我们是来复制卡的
We're here to copy the card.

250
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,580
然后就离开  明白吗
Then we leave. Got it?

251
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,010
你得到迈克的消息了吗
Have you heard from Michael?

252
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,210
没有  怎么了?
No. Why?

253
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,510
没事  我要快点搞定这个任务
Nothing. I want this thing done.

254
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,680
维加斯决不是久留之地
Vegas ain't my town.

255
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,840
真是个傻子  是吧
What a fool,huh?

256
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,640
怎么会有人不爱这个地方呢
How could anyone not love this place,right?

257
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
看看这些画面  就在那
Check this out. Right there.

258
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,280
那个亚洲人
The Asian guy.

259
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,980
我好像在哪见过他
I know I've seen him someplace before.

260
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,140
弄得怎么样了?
So what do you have for me?

261
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,410
伽特是什么
So what's "GATE"?

262
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,810
你说什么?
Excuse me?

263
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,240
在那个盒子上写着呢
It's on that box.

264
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,180
-你为什么想知道呢  -只是好奇
Why do you want to know? Just curious.

265
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,010
假如我要告诉你
What if I was to tell you

266
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,010
我认为你只是在拖延时间呢
I think you're just stalling?

267
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,140
拖延时间  直到你可以想出一条妙计
Biding time till you can figure out some MacGyver way

268
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,340
-离开这儿  是吧  -我告诉你  你在用枪
to get your ass out of here,huh? I'd say you've got that gun

269
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,980
指着能够帮助你的人
pointed at the one person who can help you.

270
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,210
所以何不停止浪费我的时间呢
So why don't you stop wasting my time?

271
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,440
求求你  别让他伤害我
Please,don't let him!

272
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,840
她怎么样啊?

273
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,580
她怎么样  迈克?
How 'bout her,Michael?

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,380
能给个我不必杀她的理由吗
Any reason why I shouldn't kill her?

275
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,440
让我们测验一下吧
Let's do a test.

276
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,540
不!
No!

277
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,040
进展到什么程度了　迈克・斯科菲尔德?
How far gone is Michael Scofield?

278
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,910
迈克  他想知道什么就告诉他吧
Michael,just tell him what he wants!

279
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,610
进展到什么程度了  迈克・斯科菲尔德
How far gone is Michael Scofield?!

280
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,910
求你了  别让他杀我  求你了
Please,don't let him. Please!

281
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,040
迈克  你啥时候变了个人似的了?
When did it happen,Michael?

282
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,610
求你了  别让他杀了我
Please,don't let him...

283
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,410
你啥时候开始不关心伤害别人的事了啊?
When did you stop caring about hurting people,huh?

284
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,040
福克斯河监狱?  还是索纳监狱?
Fox River? Sona?

285
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,210
你要在子弹穿透她的脑袋时
You gonna keep dragging

286
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,140
选择视而不见吗
your feet while I put a bullet in her brain?

287
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,980
你为何不把枪放下
Why don't you put that gun down.

288
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,640
帅哥  你开始动笔的时候我就会把枪放下了!
I'll put it down when you start writing down,Pretty!

289
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,240
最后的机会  三
Last chance. Three!

290
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,380
二  一
Two! One...

291
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,740
我说  我说
All right! All right!

292
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,080
这些纸  是要拼在一起的
The pages,they fit together.

293
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,780
但是它不是个地图
But it's not a map.

294
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,310
是一张设计图
It's a blueprint.

295
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,680
什么设计图
For what?

296
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,640
我们的朋友贝里克  戴着
Our friend,Bellick,is wearing

297
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,440
一个政府发的脚踝监视器
a government-issued ankle monitor.

298
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,010
我猜斯科菲尔德也有一个
My guess is that Scofield has one,too.

299
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,710
我就知道那个贱人在拖延时间
I knew that son of a bitch was slow-walking me.

300
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,710
任何时候  联邦官员都有可能
Any minute,federal agents could come

301
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,210
破门而入
blasting through that door.

302
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,710
那我们该怎么办?
So what do we do?

303
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,140
我要你弄到那个监视器的生产资料和序列号
I need you to get the make and serial number of that monitor.

304
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,780
放松一点  振作精神  戴茜小姐
Feel free to pitch in here,Miss Daisy.

305
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,310
如果让斯科菲尔德知道我卷入其中就完了
If Scofield knows I'm involved,this is over.

306
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,740
我们需要他的帮助
We need to keep him on point.

307
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,480
现在  你出去把线索找出来
Now,get out there and get that information.

308
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,710
那些特工怎么办
What about the agents?

309
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,640
兵来将挡
Let 'em come.

310
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,640
我们怎么知道他会出来赌博
How do we even know this guy's out gambling?

311
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,280
那家伙有30万美元的信用额度  还有免费的客房
The guy's got $300,000 in credit and a comped room.

312
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,540
他就在这里  继续找下去
He's here. Keep looking.

313
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,040
莎拉
Hey,Sara.

314
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,540
我知道现在不是谈这个话题的最佳时机
Hey,uh,I realize this might not be the best time for this,

315
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,040
但迈克还没给我打过电话
but I still haven't heard from Michael.

316
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,380
他们正在解决蒂博格吧
They must be dealing with T-Bag.

317
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,580
-林肯  别这样  -什么
Lincoln,come on. What?

318
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
维加斯不是你的地盘
Vegas just isn't your town?

319
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,440
任何你告诉我的事
From everything I've heard about you,

320
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,380
都可能极大地改变进程
that would be a pretty big change of pace.

321
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,940
我也这么想
I guess so.

322
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,540
林肯  告诉我好吗
Lincoln,please talk to me.

323
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,510
迈克有和你说过妈妈的事情吗
Has Michael told you about Mom?

324
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,910
没有
No.

325
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,380
他们很像
They were much alike.

326
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,980
有着同样的想法
They got the same mind.

327
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,180
当妈妈变老的时候  她开始失去意识
As Mom got older,she started to lose it.

328
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,040
我们后来才知道
We,uh,later found out

329
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,580
这是脑瘤的征兆
it was a symptom of a brain tumor,hama...

330
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,040
错构瘤
Hamartoma. Yeah.

331
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,780
她小时候  经常流鼻血
As a kid,she got nosebleeds.

332
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,910
后来不留鼻血了
They stopped.

333
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,780
当她30岁的时候  又开始流了
In her 30s,they started up again.

334
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,310
她后来死于动脉瘤
She later died of a brain aneurysm.

335
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,410
你告诉我这些  是想让我知道
And you're telling me this,because Michael and his mother

336
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,410
迈克和他妈妈有一样的症状  对吗
are similar in that way,too,right?

337
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,810
他小时候也流鼻血的
He got nosebleeds as a kid.

338
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,010
后来也不流了  但几天前
They stopped,and the last couple of days

339
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,740
他又开始了
they started up again.

340
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,140
你妈妈几岁时候过世的
How old was your mom when she passed away?

341
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,580
31岁
Thirty-one.

342
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,140
迈克刚刚31岁啊
Michael's just turned 31.

343
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,640
我找到他了
I found him.

344
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,240
盯着他
Keep an eye on him.

345
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,010
好的
Okay.

346
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,810
你是安德鲁・布劳纳吗
Andrew Blauner?

347
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,110
恩  是的
Uh,yeah.

348
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,480
有什么可以为您效劳的吗
Can I help you?

349
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,980
希望可以
I hope so.

350
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,170
我想知道你有没有男朋友或者室友之类的
Any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?

351
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,000
没有
No.

352
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,600
今天有预定外卖吗
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

353
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,630
没有
No.

354
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,070
我再给你一次
I'm giving you one more...

355
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,900
这些都是什么啊
What is all this?

356
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,330
你还好吗
You okay?

357
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,370
他们让我别和你说话
They told me not to talk to you.

358
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,000
他们?  他们是谁?
"They"? Who's they?

359
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,030
这是惠斯勒的设计图
This is Whistler's blueprint.

360
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,270
我们可以在这个建筑里找到锡拉
It's the building where we can find Scylla.

361
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,670
换句话说就是在伽特公司里
In other words,it's GATE.

362
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,300
锡拉在哪
Where's Scylla?

363
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,100
我在看到楼之前不能确定
I can't be certain until I see the building itself,

364
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,000
但是我确定就在办公室下面的某个地方
but I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here,below this office.

365
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,100
什么是锡拉
What is Scylla?

366
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,870
是公司的小黑名单
It's The Company's little black book.

367
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,000
我想你现在就带我去伽特公司
I want you to take me to GATE,now.

368
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,800
因为你能从锡拉里嗅出钱的味道　是吧
Because you can smell that Scylla money,can't you?

369
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,200
那就是你为什么参加的原因　就像我一样
That's what you're in it for,just like me.

370
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,570
说出来
Say it.

371
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,900
说吧
Come on.

372
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,530
我想你说出来
I want you to say it.

373
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,830
我加入是为了钱
I'm in it for the money.

374
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,170
你看到了
You see?

375
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,530
我们其实没什么区别
We ain't so different after all.

376
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,600
说
Yes?

377
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,670
当・赛尔夫不在家
Don Self is not at his house.

378
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,700
看起来他跑路了
Looks like he cleared out.

379
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,530
通知局里我们的手下还有洛城警方
Notify our people inside the Bureau and LAPD.

380
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,670
我觉得他跑不了多远
I doubt that he could have gotten very far.

381
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,330
长官
Sir?

382
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,630
现在不行
Not now.

383
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,870
当・赛尔夫要见你
Don Self is here to see you.

384
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,570
提个醒  朋友　她性冷淡
Got to warn you,friend,she's cold.

385
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,370
[数据卡存储空间已满  请清理或更换磁卡]

386
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,670
[短信: 设备故障  撤]

387
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,830
祝你好运　伙计
Good luck,pal.

388
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,030
盯着他
Stay with him.

389
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,330
斯科菲尔德就在那里
Scofield's really getting somewhere in there.

390
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,730
效率挺高的嘛
Man works fast.

391
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,300
他说如果看不到我以前在哪工作的
Says he can't get any further

392
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,400
就无法进展下去
without seeing my former place of employment.

393
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,300
你把我们的绊脚石处理掉了吗
Did you take care of our little troll problem?

394
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,200
想都别想对我干这种事
Don't even think about doing this to me.

395
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,430
你可不能过河拆桥甩了我啊
My name's on the door.

396
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,170
要不是我觉得你还有利用价值
If I didn't think you were valuable,

397
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,230
你早就死翘翘了
you'd be dead already.

398
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,770
这只是有点信息超载  伙计们
It's-It's just a little sensory overload,guys.

399
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,430
只是卡上没有空间了
There just wasn't any room for the card.

400
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,870
不错 因为如果我们把装置打开
Right. Because if we turn the device on

401
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,870
它就把赌场里所有的卡上信息都收集来了
in the casino,it fills up on all the data from the slots.

402
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,930
就像他们付账的时候
Like when they're about to pay out.

403
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,200
-这绝对不是预料之中的　-是吗
Oh,it's completely unintentional. Really?

404
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,730
是的　这不就是你造这玩意儿的初衷吗
Yeah. It's not why you built the damn thing in the first place?

405
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,930
如果我们不需要你
If we didn't need you...

406
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,430
可你们需要我　我们从长计议  好吗
But you do,so just take a brewski and chill,all right?

407
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,930
我们要想个办法让斯库得利一个人待着
Okay,we need to figure out a way to get Scuderi alone.

408
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,100
喂
Yeah.

409
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,600
老男人在水池边出现了
The old man just showed up at the pool.

410
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,400
从他穿着来看
From what he's wearing,there's no way

411
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,000
他身上不可能有卡
he's got the card on him.

412
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,230
跟着他
Stay with him.

413
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,900
卡在他房里
Card's in his room.

414
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,070
告诉我  唐纳德
Tell me,Donald,

415
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,570
你臆想中我们碰头的这一刻会是怎样一番景象呢
how did you play this moment out in your head?

416
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,270
你想到你自己会过来吗
Did you picture yourself coming in here,

417
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,530
昂首挺胸  盛气凌人地
chest out,jaw squared,

418
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,170
准备让我给你答案
ready to demand answers?

419
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,600
你可曾在幻想中想过
Did you at any time in your fantasy

420
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,130
你会这么紧张呢
imagine that you would be this nervous?

421
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,100
老实说 我从前没想过
Honestly,I,uh... I didn't think much past

422
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,600
把这些东西给你
giving you these.

423
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,600
柏林　尼日利亚
Berlin. Nigeria.

424
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,630
康姆利集团
The Comrie Group.

425
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,730
怎么不把肯尼迪遇刺
Why not JFK

426
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,830
和林德伯格绑架案也一块儿搞来?
and the Lindbergh baby while you're at it?

427
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,000
孩子
Son,

428
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,900
这些事情都已经调查完毕了
those matters have been fully vetted.

429
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,300
都是些陈年往事了
They're relics.

430
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,800
我跟这些一点关系都没有
I had nothing to do with them,and if

431
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,830
如果这些是你调查我的原因
this is why you've been pulling data on me,

432
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,600
我可以省你不少麻烦呢
I could have saved you a lot of trouble.

433
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,200
好吧　这些记录
Okay. Well,these records

434
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,200
和足以解释我调查你涉嫌参与这些事件原因
and a sealed letter explaining my investigation

435
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,170
的这封密封的信
into your involvement with these matters

436
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,770
已被送到了国内五位律师手中
was sent to five lawyers across the country.

437
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,100
万一我遇到什么不测
If anything happens to me,

438
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,570
万一我失踪了　或是最终横尸荒野了
if I go missing,anything,if I wind up dead,

439
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,130
那封信就会被公开
that letter is to be unsealed...

440
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,700
然后他们会发现和我有牵连的线索都是死胡同
And they will find cold trails that lead nowhere near me.

441
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,870
没关系
It doesn't matter.

442
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,000
如果调查你的政府探员
If a government agent

443
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,200
被发现浮尸于
who was looking into you is found floating

444
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,530
洛杉矶某条河里或者任何你计划的地方
in the L.A. River,or whatever else you have planned,

445
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
将军　你也不会有好日子过
your life,General,will change dramatically.

446
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,300
会有媒体的质疑报道和监视
There will be questions,media coverage and surveillance,

447
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,830
你和公司所做得一切
and whatever you and the Company are trying to do next

448
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,000
和你的小把戏
with your little Laos game,

449
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,830
或者是你们计划的东西
or whatever else you have planned,

450
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,700
都将暴露于众目睽睽之下
it'll be next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you.

451
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,500
好吧　请离我远点
Okay? So back off of me.

452
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,500
你不是
You are not

453
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,030
第一个想企图扳倒我的人了
the first person to attempt something like this.

454
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,500
大多数我习惯称同仁的
Most of the others I now fondly call my colleagues.

455
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,730
都学着
They've learned to put

456
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,800
转移自己的兴趣关注其他的事情
their determination and focus to better use,

457
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,330
并得到了更好的补偿

可能是库萨县的人渣
may be Coosa County trash,

483
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,070
但是科尔・普发是个人才

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,500
不知道你能不能帮帮我

这是我22岁的表妹的的单身派对

497
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,630
听我说
Wait for it.

498
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,300
我们在玩寻宝游戏
There's a scavenger hunt,

499
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,900
我们组派我去
and my team has tasked me

500
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,870
拍一张胖老头住的高级套房的照片
with getting a photograph in a whale's suite.

501

我像胖老头吗
I'm a whale?

你想在我的房间照张相?

505

我知道这个请求实在冒昧唐突
And I realize it's a completely inappropriate request,

506
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,100
但他们已经怨我太扫他们的兴了

抱歉
I'm sorry.

508
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,800
我怕是爱莫能助了
I just can't help you.

509
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,670
如果我请求你呢
What if I said "please"?

510
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,930
我真的有点绝望了
I'm actually a little desperate.

你不是他喜欢的类型
You're not his type.

517
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,800
就在你坐下之前
Right before you sat down,

518
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,630
他还问我是不是想去找乐子
he asked me if I liked to party.

519
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,830
-绝对不行　-拜托了

玛丽克鲁兹不会知道的

522
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,500
我真想掐断他的脖子
I'm gonna snap his neck.

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,440
到他房间　呆上两分钟就离开如何?
Get to his room,stay two minutes,then leave,all right?

524
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,300
去他房里待上两分钟就走  行么

好好 　同时呢? 　在电梯里?
Yeah,yeah,and in the meantime,what? In the elevator?

526
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,570
佯装你不是那种很随便的人　然后玩玩他
Just play hard to get,you know,and then let him nuzzle

527
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,430
让他嗯啊嗯啊...
a little bit. Whoa,whoa...!

528
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
嘿　我们还能有什么选择?

继续　后面没什么

了解
I know.

534
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,830
有什么锋利点的东西么?
Do we have anything sharp?

535
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,030
你听说锡拉值多少?
So,what are you hearing,uh,Scylla is worth,huh?

我听说

别人怎么告诉的你来着
Is that a rough ballpark

539
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,470
大约是个什么价钱?
in terms of what you,uh... what you've been told?

540
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,630
瞧我们发现什么了?
What do we have here?

541
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,530

我想我得想点生财之道了  你说呢
I guess I got to work that out,huh?

假如你不必再为生计发愁呢?
What if you didn't have to?

549

以我的财力  或许可以

很快活逍遥的那种...
The easy kind...

553

轻轻松松我就付你1000美元

我不知道　你怎么不自己去搞明白呢

你我合作  到此为止
I'm done helping you.

566
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,860
貌似有些人陷入了
Sounds like someone's caught

567
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,160
消极怠工的状态里了

还是我来给你的脑袋瓜子提提神吧

我要把你锁这屋里

Just how do you plan on...

574
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,230
你们根本不清楚自己在做什么蠢事!
y'all have no idea what you're doing.

575
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,160
斯科菲尔德  没有我你成不了事的

我从顺化服役期中学到的

我会付你1000块
And I'm gonna pay you $1,000.

612
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,000
再等一分钟
He's got a minute.

613
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,030
我就去找他
Then I'm going after him.

614
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,000
设备复制到那张卡了吗
Did it copy the card?

615
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,060
复制到了
Yep.

616
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,060
好的  下载吧
All right,download that.

617
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,900
你有5分钟
You got five minutes.

618
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,900
他的老婆在上面
His wife was up there.

619
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,730
然后呢
And...?

620
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,100
就当这一切从没在这发生过
It stays in Vegas.

621
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,600
嘿　伙计们
Uh,hey,guys.

622
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,100
我去方便一下
I'm gonna go hit the head,and I'll be out

623
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,130
就出去一会儿  行吗
in a minute,all right?

624
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,660
哦也!
Yes.

625
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,600
两个...两个回合
Two... two... two pulls.

626
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,800
两回合  他连续赢了
Two pulls,and he won the progressive.

627
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,300
他死哪去了
Where the hell is he?

628
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,930
我去找他
I'll go get him.

629
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,230
格伦先生
Mr. Glenn.

630
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,200
我们有麻烦了
We got a problem.

631
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,960
让我们打开天窗说亮话
It was made clear

632
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,260
我们不再欢迎你涉足
you were never again welcome

633
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,230
任何一家内华达州的赌场
in any Nevada gaming establishment.

634
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,230
等一下  他们告诉我只以5年为限...
Wait,wait,uh,I was told there was only a five-year...

635
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,500
我们从未对你这么承诺过
No such thing was said to you.

636
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,530
那玩意是干什么用的  是游戏主机的
What's that do? It's a battery pack

637
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,930
一个电池组
for a video game console.

638
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,660
你得买个新的了
You'll need to buy a new one.

639
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,960
我已把卡的内容下载到我的本本里了
I already downloaded the card onto my laptop,

640
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,930
而且  我可以再弄一个设备
and... and I can build another device.

641
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,260
你说弄一个要几个月
You said this one takes months.

642
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,260
我们没有几个月的时间
We don't have months.

643
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,300
我告诉你
You know what?

644
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,030
我们应该把你这混球丢在沙漠里
We ought to leave your ass in the desert.

645
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,800
我们把他带回洛杉矶
Let's get him back to L.A.,

646
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,500
然后让赛尔夫来好好修理他
and let Self sort him out.

647
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
走吧
Let's go.

648
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
看那小样儿  倒是挺能吼的
For a little guy,he has some set of lungs.

649
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,460
-贝里克和那女的怎样了  -都安顿好了
How's Bellick and the girl? All taken care of.

650
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,930
我会将蒂博格监禁起来  严加看守
I'm gonna keep T-Bag in protective custody

651
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,930
直到我们拿到锡拉  然后我就会让一些
until we get Scylla-- then,I'm gonna make somebody

652
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,460
在伊利诺斯商务部里头的人  "爽歪了"
at Illinois DOC very,very happy.

653
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,560
可是更重要的是
But more importantly,

654
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,130
房间的楼下究竟有何玄机呢
what the hell is that room downstairs?

655
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,560
那里没有他们可以藏那个
That's not where they keep the device

656
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,730
能破译锡拉设备的地方 对不对
that decodes Scylla,is it?

657
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,100
没有
No.

658
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,100
那只是蒂博格自己认为有而已
That's just what T-Bag thought.

659
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,800
通向锡拉之路只能从这个位置出发
The road to Scylla only begins down there.

660
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,700
这里就是我们逮住蒂博格的房间
This is the room where we've got T-Bag now.

661
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,700
只要翻过南墙
Just past the south wall,

662
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,960
那里有个隧道入口  那个入口
there's an access tunnel that runs

663
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,660
直通向外面300码的地方
for about 300 yards or so.

664
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,460
穿过那里  我们就进去了
We get through that,we're in.

665
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,800
那里就是我们能破译锡拉的所在了
That's where we can decode Scylla.

666
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,130
还有这就是克兰兹将军办公室
And this is the building

667
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,330
所在的那幢楼
where General Krantz's office is.

668
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,560
-对头咯  -我今天才刚去过那里
-There you go. -I was there today,

669
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,830
可是我得提醒你  那里的保全系统
but I have to tell you,the security

670
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,930
很好很强大
in that place is unbelievable.

671
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,060
根据设计图
According to the blueprint,

672
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,260
建筑的底部结构是完全暴露的
the substructure is completely exposed.

673
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,560
这用不了24小时
It shouldn't take more than 24 hours

674
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,300
-就可以去到那里  -这只用花24小时吗
-to get in there. -It's only gonna take 24 hours?

675
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,100
我们只要先把最后一张卡搞到手就行了
All we have to do is get that last card first.

676
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,000
那么  基于目前我已经破译的部分
Well,based on what I've deciphered so far,

677
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,230
我们需要随时可以进入伽特公司
we're gonna need around-the-clock access to GATE,

678
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,530
现在就开始行动
starting immediately.

679
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,460
如果你能帮我们弄到制服和证件的话
If you can get us some suits and IDs,

680
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,130
我们可以像国税局审计员一样进去
we could go in there as IRS agents

681
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,500
审查账目  我是指审查
auditing the books-- I mean,considering

682
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,060
他们在进行何种不法勾当
the kind of racket they're running,

683
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,900
瞒天过海  天衣无缝
nobody would have a problem believing that.

684
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,460
你能做到吗
Can you make that happen?

685
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,600
是的  我能做到
Yeah,I could do it.

686
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,500
在垃圾桶下面
It's under the can.

687
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,330
喂
Hello?

688
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,930
我们是一条道上混的
We have a lot in common.

689
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,300
是吗  你是谁
Yeah,who is this?

690
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,130
另一个参与你们群雄逐鹿的利益集团
Just another interested party in what you're up to.

691
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,800
是吗  你指什么
Yeah,what's that?

692
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,060
锡拉
Scylla.

693
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,600
打开那个信封
Open the envelope.

694
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,130
[惠斯勒那本鸟类书的部分残页]

695
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,160
我手头只有77页
The pages I've got only go up to 77.

696
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,960
这就是补充的新设计图吗
Is this more blueprint?

697
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,700
我不知道
I don't know.

698
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,330
你想怎样
What do you want?

699
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,660
我不知道你们都对蒂博格干了些什么
I don't know what you've done

700
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,060
不过除非我亲眼看到他
with Bagwell,but unless I see him,

701
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,700
否则你们就拿不到剩下的书页
you're not getting the rest of the pages.

702
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,700
是吗
Is that right?

703
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,300
把电话给我
Give me that.

704
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,860
你是何方神圣?
Who is this?

705
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,330
你好啊  迈克
Hello,Michael.
