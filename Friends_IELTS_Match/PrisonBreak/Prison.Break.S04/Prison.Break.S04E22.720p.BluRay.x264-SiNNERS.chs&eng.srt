天啊  什么都没有
God. Nothing. It's dead.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,170
他们就要弄清楚了
They're figuring it out.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,470
这是种什么样的炸药
What kind of explosives are we talking about?

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,760
自制炸药
Little home brew.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,310
迈克说它能释放出C4塑胶炸药
Michael says it has the energy release of C4.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,140
再试一次
Run the diagnostic again.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,230
快试
Run it.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,980
都是C4吗
Almost C4?

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,190
是的
This is it.

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,450
我们最后的机会  愿上帝保佑
Last chance for everybody.And we're gonna need a little luck.

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,950
要是我出了什么事

00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,080
务必让L.J.和索菲... ...
...make sure L.J. and Sofia....

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,080
明白
You got it.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,210
-我也一样  -是的
-Same for me? -Yeah.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,750
低头  我们开始
Yeah, put your head down, let's go.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,550
开始
Let's go.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,650
随着时间的流逝
You know, someday,weeks will go by. Maybe even years.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,020
我们会淡忘这些事
It won't even cross our minds.

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,150
只要我们活下去
Yeah, all we gotta do is survive.

21
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,280
我们会的
We will.

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,820
我保证
Promise.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,330
-发生什么事了  -没反应
-What happened? -Nothing.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,040
引爆器一定失灵了
The detonator must have failed.

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,750
拖住他们  我们五分钟后到
Distract them. We'll be there in five minutes.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,630
-我们没有时间了  -那你必须手动引爆
-No, we don't have five seconds. -Then you'll have to trigger it manually.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,800
我有多少时间
How much time is that gonna give me?

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,800
滚出来  马上
Out. Now.

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,850
阿历克斯
Alex?

30
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,270
阿历克斯
Alex?

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,650
这里面什么都没有
It's wiped clean.

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,900
-不可能  -真的吗
-That's not possible.-Really?

33
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,070
-那它在哪  数据在哪  -我拿的时候还好好的
-Then where is it? Where is the data? -It was intact when I took it.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,490
听着
I'll tell you what.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,700
如果它10秒钟内没反应
It doesn't boot up in 10 seconds...

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,700
我会让你脑浆迸发
...I'm gonna splatter your skull all over these walls.

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,830
是我来主动找的你
I came to you.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,210
我想结束这一切  我不会陷自己于不义
I want this over, I wouldn’t jeopardize that.

39
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,710
我不相信迈克就这么让你拿走
I don't believe that Michael just let you have it.

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,630
他没有  趁他不在时我拿的
He didn't. He left me alone in a room and I took it.

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,390
他就一点没怀疑你
And that wasn't the least bit suspicious to you?

42
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,470
也许吧  我
Maybe, I--

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,770
我不知道
I don't know.

44
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,390
你是在耍我吧
Are you lying?

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,650
杀了他
Kill the junkie.

46
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,580
你呼吸困难  是不是很痛
Your breathing's short? Does it hurt?

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,330
-我还好  -你好像是肺部虚脱
-I'm fine.-Like hell, you collapsed your lung.

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,580
不去医院  那跟去监狱没啥区别
No hospitals. Hospitals mean jail.

49
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,170
快点  快点
Come on, come on.

50
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,550
-你能帮他治疗吗  -要先检查检查再说
-Can you treat him?-I need a better look before I can try.

51
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,010
克里斯蒂娜呢
Christina?

52
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,800
死了
Buried.

53
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,360
你个废物
Ugh! You pathetic slug.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,150
莎拉是我们的唯一筹码
Sara was the only leverage we had.

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,030
斯科菲尔德是个全才  可啥时候成蜘蛛侠了
Scofield's donned many a chapeau, but human fly?

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,240
我哪知道他会飞檐走壁
I should anticipate him scaling the building?

57
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,000
布饶发  给我枪
Move on Panama. Broffer, your .9.

58
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,840
巴格威尔  为我卖命的人
Men in my employ, Bagwell...

59
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,550
要履行职责
...anticipate.

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,260
尽忠职守
They cover their bases.

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,640
他们都能完成任务
They refuse to fail...

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,810
但你却一事无成
...which you seem to do with unyielding consistency.

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,270
莎拉的手机
That's gotta be Sara's phone.

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,940
我必须接
I should answer it.

65
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,690
将军  你不会有什么损失的
What do you got to lose, general?

66
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,160
喂
Hello.

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,620
谁
Who the hell is this?

68
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,580
是费尔南多・苏克雷吗  谢天谢地
Is this Fernando Sucre? Oh, thank you, God.

69
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,620
-巴格威尔
-Bagwell?

70
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,830
我们是一条船上的  一条船
And we're on the same team, brother. Same team.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,380
我正处于水深火热中  
The old boy's in a hell of a pickle.

72
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,590
迈克在哪
Where's Michael?

73
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,630
他妈妈抓走了他还有唐克雷蒂跟林肯
Uh, his mother snatched him and Tancredi, Linc too.

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,550
而我吃了一记闷棍
And I, personally, took a nasty beat down.

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,010
-她把他们关哪了  -我知道  但不能在电话里说
-Where does she have them? -I got an idea, I can't say on the phone.

76
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,310
我得小心点  朋友
I'm running scared, amigo.

77
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,560
冷静
Okay, cool it, you know what?

78
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,940
我们找到个人能帮我们  但我要找到迈克
We got somebody who can help us but I need to get ahold of Michael.

79
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,610
我们应该碰碰头  通通信息
We should, uh, get together and pool our resources.

80
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,610
72大街的公园  1小时后见
The park on 72nd Avenue. Uh, in an hour.

81
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,160
-好  马上到  -太好了
-Okay, I'll be there. -Excellent, perfecto.

82
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,410
你找到能帮忙的人了
You got someone who can help on his cause.

83
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,750
我相信他能引出斯科菲尔德
I'm certain he can draw out Scofield.

84
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,920
你相信个屁
You're certain of nothing.

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,460
但我一小时后要跟斯科菲尔德的朋友见面
Yet I do have a sit-down with Scofield's friend in an hour.

86
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,460
将军  你没有更好的办法了
You got no better hand, general.

87
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,680
跟着他去
Go with him.

88
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,930
如果他有古怪  打爆他的头
If he gets squirrelly,put a bullet in his brain.

89
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,570
你还真是稀客
You are a sight for sore eyes,my friend.

90
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,860
少来了
Can the reunion.

91
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,740
-迈克和林肯在哪  -他们处境不妙
-Where can I find Michael and Lincoln? -Apparently they're at dire straits.

92
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,320
你聋了吗
Are you deaf?

93
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,910
好着呢  刚才还听到你身上的硬币响
Unlikely, amigo, I just heard the dime drop on your sorry ass.

94
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,250
看到我左肩旁的人吗
From the bench over my left shoulder,the gentleman in the Wayfarers.

95
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,290
你脑袋还像在福克斯河一样不好使  
Like in Fox River,you never thought things through.

96
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,380
告诉我要帮那兄弟俩的人是谁
You're gonna name the friend who said he'd show up and help out the brothers.

97
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,970
把莎拉的手机给我  不然我打破你的脸
No, you're gonna hand Sara's phone or I'll break your face.

98
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,180
说我是聋子  我看你是瞎子
You accuse me of being deaf,you're the one who's gone blind.

99
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,810
那家伙可是公司一流的杀手
The man's a Company operative-trained assassin.

100
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,480
伙计  你好啊
What's up, Jethro?

101
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,830
我们可不是在福克斯河了  T-Bag  走吧
We're a long way from Fox River,T-Bag. Let's go.

102
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,160
我拿到唐克雷蒂的电话了
Yeah, I got Tancredi's phone.

103
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,330
往一个号码打了很多次
There's a bunch of calls made to a single number.

104
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,340
应该是迈克的号
I think it's Michael's.

105
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,680
他有糖尿病吗  是否忘了吃药
Is he diabetic? Medication he may have missed?

106
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,010
不清楚  他是不是装的
I have no idea.Any chance he's faking it?

107
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,770
不是  瞳孔放大
No, pupils are dilated.

108
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,560
他需要CT透视  心电图和胸部X光
He needs a head CT stat,EKG and a chest x-ray.

109
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,650
可能是脑淤血或心脏病
May have bled into his brain or had a heart attack.

110
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,150
弗朗哥  仓库里不仅有斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯
Franco. It wasn’t just Scofield and Burrows.

111
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,030
还有赛尔夫
This is the team that Self had at the warehouse.

112
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,490
前联邦探员
Former federal agent.

113
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,620
赛尔夫干了些不法勾当
Yeah, Self was into something nasty.

114
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,580
赛尔夫  能听到吗
Agent Self, can you hear me?

115
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,540
弗朗哥探员  我们要把他转移
Agent Franco, we have to move him.

116
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,290
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯在哪
Where are Scofield and Burrows?

117
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,330
我们要走了
We're going now.

118
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,550
等等  他的手动了  他能听见
Wait, his finger moved.He can hear me.

119
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,260
赛尔夫探员  你能帮助我们吗
Agent Self, can you help us?

120
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,720
他哪都不能去
He's not going anywhere.

121
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,640
迈克  计划是什么
Michael, what's the plan?

122
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,140
我们能相信谁
Who do we trust?

123
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,310
没有人
No one.

124
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,850
我们别无选择
We're out of options.

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,400
我们应该把它毁了
Then maybe we destroy it.

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,480
别无选择吗
Is that it?

127
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,990
穷途末路了吗
Is that where we're at?

128
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,030
如果将军决定报复应该怎么办
What if the general decides to retaliate?

129
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,450
即使我们给了他  他也会的
He will even if we give it to him.

130
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,910
我们可以把它弄碎  烧了
We can crush it, incinerate it.

131
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,000
扔到海里
Throw in the ocean.

132
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,870
-都行  -阿历克斯
-All three sound good.-Alex?

133
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,170
好吧
All right.

134
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,130
就这么决定了
Then it's decided.

135
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,720
喂
Hello?

136
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,970
你好  迈克
Hello, Michael.

137
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,190

你可真不好找啊
You're a tough man to get ahold of.

139
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,530
听说你死了
I heard you were dead.

140
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,040
那些流言言过其实了
Those rumors were greatly exaggerated.

141
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,370
我没有
No, I was, um...

142
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,040
我被与公司的对着干的一个组织救了
...freed by a group working against the Company.

143
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,920
你父亲成立的组织  我跟他们一起工作
The group founded by your father,I'm working with them.

144
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,300
我从那时起就一直跟他们工作
Now I've been working with them ever since.

145
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,010
可以帮我一把
Could have used a hand, Paul.

146
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,550
我来了
Here I am.

147
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,100
你拿到锡拉了吗
Do you have Scylla?

148
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,550
你认为呢
What do you think?

149
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
你拿到了
I think you do.

150
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
我也知道警察和联邦局的人在找你
I also know that you're wanted by the police and the feds.

151
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,940
现在说说将军和你母亲
Not to mention the general and your mother.

152
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,820
她不成问题
She won't be a problem.

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,940
今天5点钟有联合国的专员到迈阿密
There is a U.N. attaché who will be in Miami today at 5:00...

154
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,820
从你那里拿走锡拉
...to receive Scylla from you.

155
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,660
就这些吗
Is that so?

156
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,120
他是联合国秘书长的首席顾问
He's chief counsel to the secretary general of the United Nations.

157
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,910
秘书长了解锡拉项目
The secretary has been briefed on the Scylla program.

158
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,500
他决定承担起责任  你只要把它交出来
He's prepared to assume responsibility.All you have to do is deliver it.

159
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,590
我们需要摆脱将军
We need to stop the general from coming after our families.

160
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,670
没问题  但你要安排这次见面
Fine, but you need to make this meeting.

161
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,260
我为什么要相信你
Why should I trust a word coming from your mouth?

162
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,100
一旦交出锡拉  你们的罪行就会一笔勾消
Once Scylla is delivered,your slate is wiped clean.

163
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,890
你们所有人
All of you.

164
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,770
你会自由
You're free.

165
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,140
那不是答案
That's not an answer, Paul.

166
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,610
毫不夸张地说  我猜你知道你拿的东西
I assume you know that what you have can--

167
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,030
可以让世界变得更好
And this is no exaggeration.--change the world for the better.

168
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,700
你只需要交出它
All you have to do is deliver it.

169
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,580
你不用相信我  你只需要
And you don't need to trust me,just trust the people...

170
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,740
相信联合国的工作人员
...that worked at the United Nations.

171
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,670
手机没电了
Phone died.

172
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,710
-他还没有好转  -来  我们把他扶起来
-He's not getting any better. -Come on. Let's get him up.

173
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,510
-我去拿点用品  -好
-I gotta get some supplies.-Okay.

174
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,350
弗罗斯特探员和巴格威尔都没有音信
No word from Agent Frost or Bagwell.

175
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,230
那个滑头  要是他擅离职守  我活剥了他
That simpering little rat.If he's AWOL, I'll skin him alive.

176
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,570
他不可能搞定弗罗斯特  他可能被抓或者死了
No way he got over on Frost,he's captured. Or dead.

177
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,440
就是说我们暴露了
So we're exposed here.

178
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,030
就这么结束了吗
This is the end.

179
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,030
真是凄惨啊
Whimpering.

180
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,740
我们可以撤走等待东山再起
There's no shame in retreating to regroup, sir.

181
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,620
那可没那么简单
That, son, is a tremendous load.

182
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,210
喂
Yeah.

183
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,170
塔台发现林肯・布鲁斯的手机信号
Lincoln Burrows' phone.Pinged to cell tower downtown.

184
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,380
我们找到他的位置了
We have his location.

185
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,470
那你还愣着干嘛
Then what are you doing here?

186
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,110
是
Yeah.

187
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,230
好
Okay.

188
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,440
是凯勒曼
And that was Kellerman.

189
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,490
这个阿拉巴马拖车男干的好事
This Alabama trailer trash has been making good.

190
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,620
你投奔了克兰兹将军
You hooked up with General Krantz.

191
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,830
-管你什么事  光头  -将军现在在哪
-What is it to you, rug head? -Well, where is the general now?

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,710
跟你爹在一个地方  没人知道
Same place as your daddy.Location unknown.

193
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,390
还记得排队等饭那一天吗
Do you remember that day we were in the chow line?

194
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,220
在福克斯河
Fox River.

195
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,810
你对我的侮辱
You made that off-handed comment to me.

196
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,100
我相信一定带了民族色彩
I believe it had a racial bent to it.

197
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,480
说对了
Yeah.

198
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,480
还记得你脱臼的下巴吗
Do you remember your broken jaw?

199
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,860
现在赶快想出点事关生死的正经事
Now, just imagine what I can do to you now with something real on the line.

200
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,400
比如
Such as?

201
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,030
我们想要索菲、L.J.和帕姆・马宏安全
We want safety for Sofia, L.J.and Pam Mahone.

202
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,740
也就是说我们需要知道将军的位置
That means we need the general's location.

203
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,250
我会有什么好处
-What's in it for me?

204
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,210
我们把锡拉交出
If we take Scylla to the place it's supposed to be...

205
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
会有一个赦免名单
...there'll be an immunity list.

206
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,590
可以有你的名字
You could be on it.

207
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,470
我的阵营虽然稍占劣势
No, where I'm sitting,I'll be momentarily compromised.

208
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,680
但你们站错队营了  斯科菲尔德搞不定的
You're backing the wrong horse.Scofield cannot pull this out.

209
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,470
我们把他交给将军  我们一辈子就不用愁了
You help me get him to the general,we are set for life.

210
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,430
我没时间废话
I don't have time for this, man.

211
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,560
你应该抓紧时间站到赢的一方  黑鬼朋友
It's time you back the winner for once,my chocolate friend.

212
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,520
坐下
Sit down.

213
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,060
将军在哪
Now, where is the general?

214
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,780
将军在哪
Now, where is the general?

215
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,290
能挺住吗
You holding up?

216
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
你要把锡拉交给凯勒曼吗
You're gonna give Scylla to Kellerman?

217
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,180
不知道  你相信他吗
I don't know. Do you trust him?

218
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,430
不相信
No.

219
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,810
自由之身听上去很美
The thought of walking free from this sounds good.

220
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,350
那是我们奋斗的目标
I mean, that was the goal.

221
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,980
迪克兰广场  5点钟  街对面
Five o'clock, Declan Plaza.It's right across town.

222
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,810
你想走就走吧  迈克
If you have to leave, Michael,you should.

223
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,440
林肯  我不会离开你的  你是我的哥哥
I'm not leaving you, Linc.You're my brother.

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,610
克里斯蒂娜可不这么想
Not according to Christina.

225
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,950
别听她胡说八道
Don't let her mess with your head.

226
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,080
也可能是事实
Oh, maybe it's true, you know.

227
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,460
我一直回忆小时候的事
I keep playing things over my head from our childhood--

228
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,380
她说什么无关紧要
It doesn't matter what she said.

229
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,500
不会改变什么的
It doesn't change anything.

230
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,510
不管你喜不喜欢  我都跟定你了
You are stuck with me whether you like it or not.

231
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,850
他们在哪  这里吗
So where are they? Here?

232
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,150
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯藏在迈阿密吗
Scofield and Burrows are hiding here in Miami?

233
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,110
写下是哪条街
Okay, look,write the name of the street.

234
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,360
写下地址  你知道的一切
Give me the, uh--The number of the address. Anything.

235
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,160
赛尔夫  我们正在谈判  植物人
You're negotiating with me, Self,you vegetable?

236
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,870
医生说可以做CT扫描了  我们要把他带走了
Doc said the CT scan is free. We gotta take him now.

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,290
不说哪都别想去
He stays till he talks.

238
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,960
他比10分钟前的情况要糟  他不会说的
He's worse than he was 10 minutes ago, he won't talk.

239
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,040
但你可以写出来
Yeah, but you can write, can't you?

240
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,510
写下我要的信息  你会得到一流护理和退休金
So you give what I need and you'll get top-notch care and a pension.

241
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,380
不然就等着
Or you can waste away in front of us...

242
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,640
脑袋缩成花生吧
...until you have the brain capacity of a peanut.

243
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,600
你自己选择
Your choice.

244
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,600
去死吧

245
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,570
冷静  冷静  好了  好了
All right, all right, all right, come on. That's enough.

246
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,440
别管他了
Just leave him.

247
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,570
冷静  好吗  冷静
Cool it, all right? Just cool it.

248
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,530
-我没事  -他要做CT扫描了
-I'm good.  -He's gonna take a CT scan.

249
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,910
你要待在这里
You're gonna stay here.

250
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,330
-明白  -好吗
-Got it.  -All right?

251
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,540
要团结
Bring it together.

252
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,380
打扰一下
Excuse me.

253
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,720
能问两句吗
May I speak to you for a second?

254
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,310
我刚才
I was--

255
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,000
阿历克斯被抓了  是联邦探员
Alex was arrested, federal agent.

256
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,420
我们要把他救出来
We need to get him.

257
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,340
如果我们把锡拉交给凯勒曼
If we give Scylla to Kellerman...

258
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,760
阿历克斯就会免罪  他没事的
...Alex gets exonerated, he's fine.

259
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,800
他没事的
He's fine.

260
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,300
要把脓水抽出来  减轻压力  帮助呼吸
We need to get the fluid out, ease the pressure, help him breathe.

261
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,140
能握住吗
Can you hold that?

262
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,020
撑不了很久  但不影响赶路
That won't last long but we can go.

263
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,910
我来开吧
Mind if I drive?

264
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,580
巴格威尔  T-Bag
The general, T-Bag...

265
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,380
将军在哪
...where is he?

266
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,010
在伊拉克我看到一些肮脏行径
You know, I saw some pretty nasty behavior in Iraq.

267
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,470
很恶心
Disgusted me.

268
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,430
我背叛了指挥官  结果惹了一身麻烦
I ratted at the chain of command and it got me a whole world of trouble.

269
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,020
不是什么善事吧
No good deed, eh?

270
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,560
所以我们也要
So the fact that we are about to get busy...

271
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,610
干跟毁了我事业一样的事了
...with some of that same stuff that ruined my career...

272
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,280
我会这样做的
...the irony doesn't escape me.

273
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,320
你们好好想想
Hell, as long as you got your thinking cap on...

274
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,740
到底谁更有赢的把握
...why don't you consider who's really the one in power?

275
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,750
是我们
We are.

276
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,800
满脸憔悴  伤痕累累
Battered and bruised.

277
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,430
死神逼近
Staring death in the face.

278
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,890
居然还不见棺材不落泪
Surprising that you need more assurance that you've come to the end of the line.

279
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,600
锡拉不在我们手上
We don't have Scylla.

280
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,190
迈克
Michael...

281
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,650
你哥哥危在旦夕
...your brother is dying.

282
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,610
看他脸上的血色一点点消失
It's fascinating...

283
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,860
可真迷人啊
...to watch the blood drain from his face.

284
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,120
你认为他想看到同样的事发生在女朋友身上吗
Do you suppose that he would like to see that happen to his girlfriend?

285
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,000
索菲
Sofia.

286
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,810
要不给我锡拉  要不看着索菲被割喉
You give me Scylla or he can sit there and watch as Sofia's throat is slit.

287
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,060
两分钟内
In two minutes...

288
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,440
你的眼球会爆炸
...you're eyeballs are gonna pop out of your head.

289
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,740
那比死还难受啊
Now, that's worse than death.

290
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,950
我不能背叛
I can't betray.

291
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,960
我注定要
My destiny is to be...

292
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,080
成为一个令人敬仰的绅士
...a respected gentleman.

293
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,420
你个混蛋  将军在哪
Where's the general,you son of a bitch?

294
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,510
表可是在转哦
Clock's ticking.

295
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,770
鲁格迷你14  口径223  杀死纳温・巴纳及的枪上
Ruger Mini-14, .223 caliber. The gun that killed Naveen Banarjee.

296
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,520
有林肯・布鲁斯的指纹
We pulled Lincoln Burrows' thumbprint off the stock.

297
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,480
监控上看到你和布鲁斯在案发现场溜达
We have video of you outside the crime scene with Burrows.

298
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,980
难道不能是巧合吗
Isn't that a coincidence?

299
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,780
我没有见过比当・赛尔夫更丢人的事了
You know, I never thought I'd see a bigger disgrace than Don Self...

300
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,240
-但你瞧啊  -你不知道
-...but lo and behold. -You have no idea...

301
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,870
-你到底在说什么  -但我看得到
-...what you're talking about. -Yeah, I got eyes, don't I?

302
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,370
你以前获过勋章  但现在你却教唆谋杀他人
You had a badge and now you're abetting an assassination.

303
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,460
林肯没杀巴纳及
Lincoln didn't kill Banarjee.

304
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,550
他是被陷害的
He was set up.

305
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,210
谁陷害他
Well, then by whom?

306
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,140
公司
It was the Company.

307
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,230
公司  明白我的意思吗
Company, you know what I'm talking about?

308
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,690
他们发明了一种叫做锡拉的设备
They've developed a device that's called Scylla.

309
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,320
等等  我们能不能停两分钟
Wait, no, can we just stop for two seconds, please?

310
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,570
叫做锡拉的设备
Device called Scylla? Ha, ha.

311
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,820
马宏  我们现在在哪个星球
What planet are we on now, Mahone?

312
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,910
如果你想重见光明  把斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯交出来
If you wanna see the light of day as a free man, give us Scofield and Burrows.

313
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,370
你们把黑白颠倒了
You're missing what's right in front of your face.

314
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,370
他们兄弟俩没杀人
The brothers didn't kill anybody.

315
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,670
你们不是说想伸张正义吗
You say you're here because you wanna do the right thing?

316
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,170
那就听我说
Then listen to me.

317
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,720
相信我说的话
Listen to what I'm telling you.

318
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,050
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯
Scofield and Burrows...

319
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,430
他们在哪
...where are they?

320
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,100
索菲
Sofia.

321
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,440
就算是生死决择
Granted, it is a fretful decision.

322
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,440
你们也考虑地够久了
But you pondered it long enough.

323
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,860
我在你手上
You have me.

324
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,820
林肯  你算什么  我只想要属于我的东西
I don't really care about you, Lincoln.I just want my property.

325
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,910
好吧  就当我知道它在哪  我凭什么告诉你
All right. Let's say I do know where it is,why should I tell you?

326
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,700
说不说你都是要杀我们
You're just gonna kill us anyway.

327
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,830
没错  你们兄弟俩横竖都是死
True. You and your brother are walking dead...

328
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,500
但如果我能在半小时内拿到锡拉
...but if I get Scylla within the next half hour...

329
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,250
我会放了索菲
...I'll release Sofia.

330
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,380
那莎拉呢
And what about Sara?

331
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,050
我们现在只谈索菲
We're negotiating for Sofia right now.

332
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,350
-我要你放了她  -迈克  那就快决定
-I want you to let her go. -And I want a decision, Michael.

333
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,970
放她走
Let her go!

334
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,310
好了
All right.

335
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,730
别动
Don't move.

336
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,830
放了索菲
Let Sofia go.

337
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,990
马上就放  打电话
Now. Make the call.

338
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
放她走
Just let her walk away.

339
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,510
是  马上
Yes, immediately.

340
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,150
好吧
All right.

341
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,190
-我们就此别过吧  -迈克  不要
-And this is where we say goodbye. -Michael, no.

342
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
-杀了他  -不要  我们走吧
-Kill him. -No. We leave.

343
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,570
-迈克  听她的  -杀了他
-Listen to her, Michael. -Kill him.

344
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,120
我只是个一无所有的
I'm just an old man.

345
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,830
糟老头
Who's lost everything.

346
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,040
迈克  你赢了
You win, Michael.

347
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,670
还有你  林肯
And you, Lincoln.

348
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,090
迈克  你赢了
You win, Michael.

349
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,050
你们都赢了
You both win.

350
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,840
这就是一场游戏  不是吗
Because it's all just a game, isn't it?

351
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,510
迈克  当你像我一样老时
When you get to be as old as I am,Michael...

352
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,510
如果你能活那么长
...should you survive so long...

353
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,310
你也会发现这就是一场游戏
...you, too, will see that that's exactly what all this is.

354
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,640
杀了他
Kill him.

355
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,690
听我说
Listen to me.

356
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,400
听我说
Just listen to me.

357
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,070
我冒着危险来这不是为了报复
I didn't risk everything to come down here for our revenge.

358
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,370
我是为了洗刷清白
I'm here to clear my name.

359
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,580
锡拉还在不
Do you have Scylla?

360
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,540
在
Yes.

361
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,380
那我们走吧
Then let's go.

362
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,100
走吧  将军
Come on, general.

363
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,640
从没料到见到你会如此兴奋
Never thought I'd be so happy to see you.

364
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,400
-告诉我  -什么
-Tell me something. -Yeah.

365
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,570
你确定凯勒曼可以信任吗
Are you sure we can trust Kellerman?

366
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,110
我们别无选择
You know the only thing I'm sure of is that he's our last option.

367
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,650
先生们  该走了
Gentlemen, we gotta leave.

368
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,410

371
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,420
站住  不然我开枪了
Freeze or I'll shoot.

372
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,130
走  快走
Go, go.

373
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,340
迈克  开车
Michael, go.

374
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,120
再不去医院  他就撑不住了
He's not gonna make it much longer without a hospital.

375
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,120
等这一切结束再说
No. Not till this is done.

376
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,870
林肯  林肯
Linc. Linc.

377

语音信箱
It's a voice mail.

382
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,400

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,400
这次你最好站在我们这边
And you better come through for us in the end.

384
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,200
他会的

那就好
Yeah, well....

386
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,240
我们比你更了解他
We know him a little bit better
than you do.

387
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,000
关掉手机
Make sure to turn the phone off.

388
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,500
克兰兹以前就这么找到我们的
It's how Krantz found us.

是  长官  明白
Yes, sir. Sir, got it.

391
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,200
你小时候在波多黎各玩过抢凳子的游戏吧
You ever play musical chairs in Puerto Rico when you were a kid?

392
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,130
-玩过  怎么了  -我们现在就这样
-I guess so. Why? -It's kind of what we got going on now.

393
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,210
这个机会  多少人正觊觎呢
Got one seat left,couple of folks vying for it.

394
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,920
斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯  把他们带过来
Scofield and Burrows, help bring them in,you go to Miami International...

只有一个机会了
Did I mention.that we got one seat left?

397
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,850
迈克和林肯试着扳倒公司
Michael and Lincoln are trying to bring down this thing called the Company.

398

斯科菲尔德和布鲁斯在哪
Where are Scofield and Burrows?

399
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,820
我们只在乎这个  这也是你出去的唯一办法
That's the only thing we wanna know.That's what's gonna help you out now.

400
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,490
我们的生活都被警察 探员
We've been screwed by every cop,every fed--

401
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,000
你想知道你妻子孩子会发生什么事吗
Do you want to know what's gonna happen to your wife, to your kid?

402
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,170
-他说到做到  -你如果不把他们带过来
-Yeah, he said it.-You're gonna know...

403
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,250
你就会知道生活被毁是什么滋味
...what getting screwed over feels like if you don't help us bring those two in.

404
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,930
放下
Drop it!

405
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,680
你认为还能去哪
Where do you think you're going?

406
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,190
转过身
Turn around.

407
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,860
慢慢地
Slowly.

408
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,200
放下枪
Drop the gun.

409
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,870
-快点  -迈克  当你
-Do it now. -Michael, when you were--

410
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,620
省省吧
Save it.

411
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,580
我不在乎
I don't care.

412
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,000
放下枪  把锡拉放地上
Drop the gun,put Scylla on the ground.

413
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,330
你就可以走了
And I'll let you walk out of here.

414
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,340
否则
If you don't...

415
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,550
我就杀了你
...I'll kill you.

416
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,840
迈克  你不会杀你妈妈的
You can't kill your mother, Michael.

417
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,010
你不是我妈妈
You were never my mother.

418
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,140
我也不是你儿子
And I'm no longer your son.

419
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,890
很好
Fine.

420
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,350
-那就开枪吧  -不要试探我
-Then pull the trigger. -Don't tempt me.

421
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,900
迈克  开枪吧
Pull the trigger, Michael.

422
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,360
为林肯报仇
Do it for Lincoln.

423
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,610
放下枪
Drop the gun!

424
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,280
你不会开枪的
You can't do it, can you?

425
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,290
哦
Oh, dear.

426
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,500
开不了了
Misfire.

427
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,880
这就是所谓的皮洛士胜利吧
I guess that's what they call a Pyrrhic victory.

428
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,510
你生是斯科菲尔德家的人
You were born a Scofield...

429
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,180
死却是布鲁斯家的鬼
...but you'll die a Burrows.

430
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,120
我们要把他和林肯送到医院
Okay, we have to get him and Lincoln to the hospital.

431
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,960
我把这个交给凯勒曼
I'll get this to Kellerman.

432
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,470
这次又得全靠你了
It's all on you again.

433
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,510
谢谢
Thank you.

434
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,560
-只管打电话
-Just make the call.

435
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,690
找到兄弟俩或与他们来往的任何人  打电话
Get Scofield or Burrows or whoever they're in business with. Get them.

436
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,110
再不打我们就去找马宏做买卖
This is your last chance before we take the deal to Mahone.

437
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,110
如果马宏开口  你也就不会在这了
If Mahone was talking,you wouldn't be here.

438
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,650
你到底怎么想的  你妻子孩子在北方
What kind of man are you? You got your woman and your baby up north.

439
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,320
你不想把她们接回来吗
Don't you wanna look out for them,get their back?

440
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,700
为了跟你坐牢的人
Give that up for guys you did time with?

441
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,700
而放弃老婆孩子
Something went down at Fox River?

442
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,460
你们都瞎了吗  看不出来他们在做大事吗
Are you blind? Don't you see they're doing something that's bigger than this?

443
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,670
-你比看起来蠢多了  -打还是不打
-Then you're dumber than you look.-Are you gonna make the call or not?

444
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,250
最后的机会
Last chance.

445
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,590
不打
No.

446
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,020
你回到监狱时  告诉狱友
When you're back in lockup,tell your celly...

447
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,440
你回绝了试图帮助你的探员
