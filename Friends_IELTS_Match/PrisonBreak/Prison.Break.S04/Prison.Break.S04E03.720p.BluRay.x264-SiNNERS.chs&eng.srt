00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,660
《越狱》剧情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,850
我提供给你的是一个免除15年刑期的机会
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail.

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,530
-用什么交换  -锡拉
In exchange for? Scylla.

5
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,660
这些是脚踝全球定位跟踪器
These are GPS ankle monitors.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,700
我是你们的头
I'm your boss.

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,340
我让你们带上跟踪器
And if I ask you to put on a monitor.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,630
你们就带上跟踪器
You put on a monitor.

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,540
惠斯勒的任务是把锡拉交给一名公司高管
Whistler assignment was to drop off Scylla to a Company executive.

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,270
他的任务是保护锡拉
And his job was to protect it.

11
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,520
当这一切结束以后  你和我
When this is, when this is all done, you and me.

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,960
我们要做个了断
We're gonna settle up.

13
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,040
我找阿历克斯
I'm looking for Alex.

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,370
-妈妈  -我们没什么好谈的
-Mom! -We're done talking.

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,220
你不能进去
You don't want to go in there.

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,880
你不能进去
You don't want to go in there.

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,200
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德和林肯・布鲁斯在哪
Where are Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows?

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,250
我发誓  我真的不知道他们在哪
I swear to you, I've no idea where they are.

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,670
怎么了
What's wrong?

20
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,290
不管它是什么  反正不对
Whatever it is, it ain't it.

21
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,250
假如说锡拉是块披萨  我们得到的只是一片
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got's a slice.

22
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,610
这么说锡拉不只是一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card.

23
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,960
是六张
It's six.

24
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,240
-你把我们卷进什么之中了  -什么
-What'd you pull us into? -Excuse me?

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,010
你以为你把我们骗过来了
You figured you'd get us on the hook.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,670
我们之后就能发现...
So we could find out for ourselves...

27
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,160
整件事有多他妈的麻烦
How screwed this whole thing was!

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,920
你到底在说什么
What the hell exactly are you talking about?

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,420
数据卡  赛尔夫特工  我说的是卡
The card, Agent Self! I'm talking about the card!

30
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,970
-根本没有用  -等等  等一下
-It's useless! -Wait, wait, hold on.

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,460
你已经得到数据卡了
You already got the card?

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,080
是的  但没有其余的5张卡  就毫无意义
Yes, but without the other five cards, it means nothing!

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,370
而我认为你早就知道
And I can only assume you knew that!

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,230
其他五张什么卡
What other five?

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,260
别装了
Don't.

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,530
其他五张什么卡
What other five?

37
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,530
罗兰下载了卡里的数据
Roland downloaded the card.

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,590
卡里没有公司的资料
There's no Company data on the card.

39
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,220
没有其他五张卡  这张就无法读取
So without the other five cards, it's unreadable.

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,860
这就像是谜题的6分之1一样
It's like one-sixth of the puzzle.

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
但这不是我的问题
But that's not my problem.

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,150
-因为我们有协议  我们已经...  -不
-Because we had a deal, and we gave you...  -No.

43
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,150
-把你要的东西拿到了  -不  没有  你们没有
-Exactly what you asked for. -No, you didn't! No, you didn't!

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,800
我们的协议是你帮我搞到锡拉
We had a deal for you to get me Scylla.

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,170
你们没还没搞到  对吧
And you haven't gotten me that, have you?

46
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,280
你向我保证过的
You gave me your word.

47
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,800
我再向你保证一次  如果你们...
And I'm giving you my word again, you will go...

48
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,190
不能把另外5张卡弄到手  就滚回监狱去
Back to prison if you can't get me those other five cards.

49
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,340
但如果你告诉我  你无法做到的话
But if you're telling me you can't get this done.

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,840
现在就告诉我  我们会把牢房帮你们准备好的
Just let me know right now, and we'll get your cell ready.

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,940
明白吗
You understand？

52
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,020
我会搞定的
I'll get it done.

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,500
还有一件事情
There's one more thing.

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,530
他怎么说的
So what'd he say?

55
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,680
我们要找到其余的卡
We got to find the other cards.

56
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,060
滚蛋吧  伙计  我们得到卡了  进行第二步吧
Screw that, man. We got the card, let's do the second step.

57
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,500
闯入那一步  结束这一切
The break-in thing, and end all this.

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,660
现在那样做没用了
It doesn't work that way now.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,090
这不公平  我们照他说的做了
It's not fair. We did what he said.

60
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,890
那给赛尔夫特工电话  说你想回福克斯河监狱
Then call Agent Self, tell him you want to go back to Fox River.

61
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,920
该死  如果找不到其余的卡  我们都得进监狱
Hell, we're all going to prison if we cannot find the other cards.

62
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,800
当政府感觉事情不妙之后
When the government the gets scared.

63
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,460
他们会先将自己置身度外
They tend to cut the cord.

64
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,380
赛尔夫提过让我们结束任务吗
Did Self talk about shutting us down?

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,090
我们还是集中精力找锡拉吧  好吗
Let's just concentrate on finding Scylla, all right?

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,370
阿历克斯.
Alex.

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,680
他要去哪
Where's he going?

68
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,130
管他呢
Who cares?

69
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,880
我们都不知从哪入手  怎么找锡拉
How are we gonna find Scylla? We don't even know where to start.

70
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,830
你找到的其他东西在哪
Where's the rest of the stuff you found?

71
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,560
还在打印
Still printing it up.

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,310
我的东西之前肯定被放在了...
When my device was in Tuxhorn's house...

73
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,940
塔克豪恩家靠近他掌上电脑的地方
It must've been left next to his PDA.

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,440
拷贝了里面所有的数据  邮件和照片
Sucked up all the data from it and got e-mails and photos.

75
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,990
有我们需要的信息吗
You see anything we can use?

76
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,800
没有  我跟你们说清楚  我只负责电脑
No, and let me be crystal clear for you guys: I point and click.

77
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,560
仅此而已  其他的事我一概不管
That's it, other than that, I'm off the clock.

78
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,330
闭嘴
Shut up.

79
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,770
等等  他的日程表在哪
Wait a minute, where's his calendar?

80
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,330
在自我感觉良好的医生那
Dr. Feelgood's got it.

81
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,470
在这儿  看看这个
Here, um, take a look at this.

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,760
这是今天的日程
This is today's date.

83
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,410
上面除了一颗星之外  什么都没有
There's absolutely nothing on it but a star.

84
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,490
其他日期塔克豪恩都详细写明了...
Every other date, Tuxhorn has details for his...

85
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,720
会面和会议的参与者  时间和地点的信息
Appointments and meetings, who he's with, when and where.

86
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,200
只有今天的日程什么都没写
This is the only thing with nothing on it.

87
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,930
他这么做一定是有原因的
It must be a reason he's keeping that secret.

88
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,860
我们为何不让赛尔夫那家伙做决定
Why are we letting this Self guy call all the shots?

89
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,510
也许我们该强硬一点
Maybe we should play some hardball.

90
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,870
不  要么帮忙  要么滚蛋
No. Either help out or get out.

91
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,360
如果你们要出声...
If you open your mouth...

92
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,840
希望你们会提供建设性的办法
I expect you to offer up a solution.

93
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,930
我不会再说第二遍
I'm not gonna say it again.

94
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,500
-喂  -知道我是谁吗
-Hello? -Do you know who this is?

95
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,900
知道
Yeah.

96
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,640
你被关在哪了
Where are you being held?

97
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,460
我不在监狱
I'm not in prison.

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,600
那你在哪
Where are you?

99
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,840
我不能说
I can't say.

100
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,490
我需要你在洛杉矶帮我取点东西
I need you to get something to me in L.A.

101
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,160
阿历克斯
Alex.

102
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,230
不是什么危险的东西  求你了  我...
It's nothing dangerous. Please, I-I...

103
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,840
我不知道我还有多少时间
I don't know how much more time I have here.

104
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,870
听着  别让我做什么...
Look, don't ask me to do something...

105
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,390
你只需要去一趟杜兰哥的住宅中介就行了
You just need to reach out to the residential agency in Durango.

106
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,330
阿历克斯  不行
Alex, no.

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,950
你知道他们做了什么吗
Do you know what they did?

108
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,630
他们杀了我的儿子
They killed my son.

109
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,570
他们杀了我的儿子
They killed my boy.

110
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,240
我不知道该说什么
I don't know what to say.

111
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,310
只要说你愿意帮我
Just say that you'll help me.

112
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,980
求你了
Please?

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,610
我需要你的帮助
I just need your help.

114
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,980
我要找到凶手
I need to find out who did it.

115
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,870
求你了
Please.

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,270
听着  我知道在福克斯河的时候你要对我保密
So listen, I know in Fox River you had to keep secrets from me.

117
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,880
现在不需要了
You don't now.

118
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,800
怎么了
What's going on?

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,160
赛尔夫说我们今天一定要找到下一个持卡者
Self said we have until the end of the day to find the next cardholder.

120
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,730
否则我们全部要回监狱
Or we all go back to prison.

121
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,060
我知道你保释了斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
I know that you bailed out Scofield and Burrows.

122
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,350
而且我知道他们不在德克萨斯的监狱里
And I know they aren't in a supermax in Texas.

123
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,670
但你知道他们在哪  对吧  布鲁斯
But you know where they are, don't you, Bruce?

124
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,730
你别再找麻烦了
You don't want any more trouble than you're already in.

125
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,930
我不是有麻烦的那个人
I'm not the one in trouble.

126
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,270
让我帮你放松一下
Let me help you relax.

127
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,350
真是美好的一天
It's a beautiful day.

128
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,730
阳光明媚
The sun is shining.

129
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,120
你能感觉到微风拂过吗
Do you feel that gentle breeze?

130
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,600
今天真是个...
It's a great day...

131
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,550
家庭野餐的好日子
For a family picnic.

132
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,640
你不这么认为吗  布鲁斯
Don't you think so, Bruce?

133
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
六张卡
Six cards?

134
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,390
当初你可不是这样告诉我的  当
That's not what you sold me, Don.

135
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,480
我知道这超出了我们的预想
I realised it's more than we anticipated.

136
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,980
是超出你的预想
More than you anticipated! .

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,710
已经有人问我...
I already have people questioning me...

138
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,770
关于我们编造的重型监狱的事了
About the supermax line we're selling.

139
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,260
整件事就是一个错误
This whole thing was a mistake.

140
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,070
不  这件事没错
No,no, this wasn't a mistake.

141
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,570
斯科菲尔德在24小时内就帮我们得到一张...
Scofield got us a card within 24 hours...

142
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,940
要被送到洛杉矶的卡
Of being dropped in Los Angeles.

143
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,510
他知道自己在做什么
He knows what he's doing.

144
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,300
听着  我愿意冒险  做好我的工作
Look, I'm willing to take the risk and do my job.

145
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
我不明白为什么你不能
I don't understand why you aren't.

146
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,710
国土安全部还没确定名称  你还没长毛的时候
I've been in Homeland Security since before it even had a name!

147
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,610
我就在这工作
Since before you even had a single short and curly...

148
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,180
那你就该清楚现在的利害关系  主任
Then you should know what's at stake here, Director.

149
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,800
如果你不下令停止  我们就可以阻止
We could stop it, but not, not if you end this now.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,610
我现在就给达洛参议员挂电话
I'm calling Senator Dallo now.

151
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,730
看看他是否想此事就此结束
I will see if he want shis thing killed or not.

152
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,360
但他是听我的建议的  当
But he follows my recommendations, Don.

153
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,440
先生  已将你到达伦敦的时间...
"Sir, changed your late London arrival...

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,710
改为7月16日下午4点
Now 7/16 at 4:00 p.m."

155
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,770
今天是16号
Today's the 16th.

156
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,040
他的日程里没有伦敦  对吧
There's nothing about London in his calendar, is there?

157
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,230
我们看是没有  没有
Not that we've seen, no.

158
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,110
没有任何来回英国的计划
Nothing about travel to or from the UK at all?

159
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,950
没有  什么都没有
No, nothing.

160
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,840
既然他在伦敦没有会面日程...
Now, why would he get an e-mail about an arrival in London...

161
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,470
为何他会收到关于抵达伦敦的邮件呢
When he has no business scheduled there?

162
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,650
可能这封邮件是一个...
It's probably because the e-mail is a...

163
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,180
暗号
Code.

164
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,100
阿历克斯  我很高兴你加入我们
Alex, I'm so glad you joined us.

165
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,110
S-C-Y-L-L-A  锡拉
S-C-Y-L-L-A, Scylla

166
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,050
今天4点的会议室是关于锡拉的
The meeting today at 4:00 is about Scylla.

167
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,620
我们可以假设塔克豪恩不是安排...
I think we can assume that Tuxhorn did not schedule...

168
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,140
自己同自己会面  所以...
A meeting with himself, so that...

169
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,910
会面的地点就是找到下一个持卡者的地方
Is where we're going to find our next cardholder.

170
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,440
好  那么下午4点是时间  还缺地点
Okay, so 4:00 p.m. is our when, we need a where.

171
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,350
如果你需要一个秘密的会面
If you were having a secret meeting.

172
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,180
不会把所有的信息一次都发送
You wouldn't send all the information together.

173
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,320
为了保险  时间和地点的信息会分开发送
You'd send the where and the when separately as a precaution.

174
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,060
还有其他和伦敦的邮件...
Were there any other e-mails sent to Tuxhorn...

175
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,980
同时发给塔克豪恩的吗
At the same time as the London e-mail?

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,710
伦敦的邮件发出几秒钟后
Within a few seconds of the London mail.

177
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,750
同一IP地址又发送了两封邮件
Two more e-mails followed from the same IP path.

178
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,700
就在这时  硬盘没有空间了
But that's when my device ran out of hard drive space.

179
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,410
追踪到了IP地址  但没有记录下内容
It picked up the IP address, but not the content.

180
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,800
追踪IP地址  找到发信人
Trace the IP address and find out who sent these e-mails.

181
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,270
听着  邮件会经过世界上很多服务器转移
Oh, look, e-mails get bounced to routers all over the world.

182
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,610
在到达收件箱之前
Before they end in your inbox.

183
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,670
无论邮件寄送到哪里  都会留下缓存文件
Wherever the mail's been, it leaves a shadow file.

184
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,130
根据地理位置  我判断这些邮件...
Based on the geography, I'm guessing these e-mails...

185
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,930
在塔克豪恩收到之前  可能在阿纳海姆的...
Probably squatted at the Anaheim server cluster...

186
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,970
服务器上停留过十亿分之一秒
A nanosecond before reaching Tuxhorn.

187
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,430
所以那就缓存文件的所在
So that's where you're going to find your shadow file.

188
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,590
那就去找
So get it.

189
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,470
拿着8位机的家伙不一定都能黑进航空航天局
Not every geek with a Commodore 64 can hack into NASA.

190
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,820
我是说  这些服务器...
I mean, these servers...

191
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,360
这些服务器有更多的防火墙
Have more firewalls than the devil's bedroom.

192
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,150
你们想要这些邮件  对不起
You want those e-mails, I'm sorry.

193
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,000
他们是在阿纳海姆的主服务器上
It's on a main server in Anaheim.

194
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,410
有可能在那个服务器上找到那些邮件吗
Is this possible to find those e-mails at that server?

195
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,980
从技术上说  是的
Technologically possible, yeah.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,220
那我们去阿纳海姆
Then we're going to Anaheim.

197
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,490
你们两个去塔克豪恩工作的地方
I want you two to go to Tuxhorn's workplace.

198
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,320
找到他  如果看见他  跟住  告诉我们
Stake it out, if you see him, tail him, call us.

199
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,190
你以为你能大摇大摆靠近服务器吗
You think you're just going to walk up to a main server?

200
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,660
你知道那里会有保安的  对吧
You know there's going to be security, right?

201
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,280
我们别无选择  找到那封邮件...
We don't have a choice, we have to find that e-mail message...

202
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,340
我们就能找到会面地点
We can find out where the meeting is.

203
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,540
找到会面地点  就能找到下一个持卡者
Find out where the meeting is, we find our next cardholder.

204
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,270
-明白吗  -我们才能不蹲监狱
-Got it? -We stay out of jail.

205
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,690
是的  祝你好运  伙计
Yeah, well, good luck, man.

206
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,620
实际上  你要和我们一起去
Actually, you're coming with us.

207
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,860
再说一次  赛尔夫让我坐在这里...
Guess again. Self told me to sit here...

208
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
负责电脑方面的事情
And make with the clickety-clack on the keyboard.

209
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,480
我哪也不去
I'm not going nowhere.

210
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,170
是吗  跟着来吧
Oh yeah, you are.

211
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,980
有人吗
Hello?

212
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,360
欢迎回到...
"Instahomes welcomes you home...

213
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,390
家具齐全的公寓
To your furnished apartment."

214
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,450
你为什么一定要找这个人
Why must you go after this man?

215
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,520
在我的家乡  有个词叫宿敌
Where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.

216
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,000
你会回来的  对吗
You're coming back, right?

217
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,270
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德太多次对我见死不救
Michael Scofield left me for dead one too many times.

218
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,820
好消息  布鲁斯
Good news, Bruce.

219
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,510
你最喜欢的阿姨去野餐了

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,700
她带来了柠檬水

兄弟姐妹们在...

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,680
追逐打闹
Green field.

所有人都来了
Everyone is here.

227
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,360
基本算是所有人

两个很重要的人没来

迈克尔・斯科菲尔德和林肯・布伦斯在哪

230
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,820
我不知道
I don't know.

231
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,590
没关系的  布鲁斯
That's okay, Bruce.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,580
我肯定你很快就会想起来了
I'm sure you'll remember soon.

233
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
享受野餐吧
Just enjoy the picnic.

你好  我是斯蒂芙妮・雷德

Okay, then.

237
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,560
不好意思  系统里没有你的名字
Sorry, your name's not in the system.

238
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,920
你能再看下吗  是R-E-E-D

239
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,460
当然
Sure.

240
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,160
知道吗  她应该松开上衣的几个扣子
You know, she should drop a few buttons on that shirt.

241
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,860
警卫就会把邮件给她

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,830
好极了
Great.

243

你在阿纳海姆吗  Michael

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,760
现在可不是去迪斯尼好时候
This is a strange time to be taking a trip to Disney.

246
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,120
听我说  我向你保证  如果你要逃跑...
Listen to me, I promise you, if you're trying to run...

247
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,660
我在帮你找另外一张卡
I'm trying to get you another card.

248
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,490
从哪  明日世界吗
From where? Tomorrowland?

249
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,990
从主服务器上的一封邮件里
From an e-mail on a main router.

250
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,590
我们认为今天下午4点有一个锡拉的会面
We think there's a Scylla meeting this afternoon at 4:00.

251
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,100
-在哪  -希望在邮件中能找到答案
-Where? -Hopefully that information will be on the e-mail.

252
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,060
迈克尔  我们没有时间了
Michael, we're running out of time.

253
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,820
那就别再浪费我的时间
Then stop wasting mine.

254
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,680
我挂电话了  我挂电话了
I got to go, I got to go.

255
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,700
你和达洛参议院谈过了
Did you talk to senator Dallo?

256
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,590
是的  谈过了  现在我要和你谈谈
Yes, I did, and now I need to talk to you.

257
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,580
我要取消这个行动
I'm shutting it down.

258
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,730
对不起  小姐  我没找到任何你的预约
Sorry, ma'am, I don't have you down for any meeting today.

259
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,050
好吧  但临时工工会说过...
Okay, um... the, uh, the temp agency said...

260
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,850
他们要举行一次面试
That they were going to set the interview.

261
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,190
再次抱歉
Again, I'm sorry.

262
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,700
好吧
Okay.

263
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,290
今天找个保姆是很难得
It was really hard to get a sitter today.

264
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,280
你能否给人力资源部打个电话...
Would you be willing just to call human resources and see...

265
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,060
看看他们愿不愿意见我一面吗
If they'll see me since I'm here?

266
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,220
好的
Sure.

267
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,730
你好  我是前台的提姆
Hey, it's Tim at the front desk.

斯蒂芙妮・雷德  R-E-E-D

271
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,890
她刚刚把保安卡交给迈克尔了
She just passed it off to Michael.

272
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,860
服务器机房可能在任何房间
Server room could be anywhere in here.

273
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,170
网络和配线技术条件都要求...
Network and wiring specifications require...

274
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,160
服务器只能在一楼
A server that's on the first floor,

275
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,070
中心位置  就像那里
Centrally located, like right there.

276
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,820
你是干嘛的  工程师还是什么
What are you, an engineer or something?

277
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,220
你确定你知道怎么做吗
Are you sure you know how to drive this thing?

278
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,030
是的  但要花点时间  我可不想被抓住
Yeah, but it's going to take a while and I don't want to get busted.

279
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,900
放松点  找到那些邮件
Just relax and find those e-mails.

280
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,990
听着  在我偷窃的时候  我在家里做...
Listen, man, when I steal, I do it from my home, in my boxers...

281
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,510
吃着大包的薯片  明白吗
Eating a bowl of Krispity Krunch, okay?

282
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,740
不会被看到  也不会被抓住
No chance of being seen, no chance of getting caught.

283
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,790
快点搞吧
Just get it done.

284
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,840
好的
Okay.

285
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,790
没事
All right.

286

快点  迈克尔  快点
Come on, Michael, come on.

287
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,820
女士
Hey, lady.

288
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,510
得到我要的东西了吗
Did you get what I need?

289
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,210

谢谢你
Thank you.

我知道你在计划什么  阿历克斯
I know what you're planning, Alex.

门怎么打不开了

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,440
-不该有这么先进的装置的  -是吗
-It shouldn't have such an advanced system. -Oh, yeah?

339
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,660
很显然有  怎么办
Well, clearly it does. Wha-Wha-What's it do?

为了灭火  这个房间所有的氧气都会被抽光

氧气正在被抽出

你越慌越糟糕
You panic, it gets worse.

我们走
Let's go.

356
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,910
你觉得我们呆在车里有用吗
You think it's better on wheels?

357
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,440
不  我们别无选择
No, we ain't got no choice.

358
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,280
我们必须等  看他是否会出现
We got to wait and see if he shows up.

359
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,960
我不是在说找塔克豪恩的事

360
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,110
我是在说找那些卡

363
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,900
哪怕那么一点的成功的机会
A snowball's chance in Haiti of actually doing this deed.

364
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,110
总比没机会好
Better than no chance.

365
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,000
我们离墨西哥只有几小时车程
Just saying we're a couple hours from Mexico.

366
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,910

他死了
He is.

377

你看  布鲁斯
You see that, Bruce?

378
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,930
你刚刚如实回答了我的问题

379
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,530

加入一个天文观察家的俱乐部的请帖
To join some kind of stargazers' club.

410
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,380
星相能用于定位地球上某个位置

411
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,300
有个网站可以给出...

412
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,780
星座图  根据时间日期...

它能找出地球相应的地点

414
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,880
你知道这个是因为...

415
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,200
因为我儿子和...
Because my son and...

416
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,510
我前妻  我以前会上这个网站
my ex and... and I used to go on this site

417
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,540
这样他们抬头看天  就知道我在哪了
So they could look up at the sky and know where I was.

418
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,330
不是这个  那个星座对应的是南极洲
That's not it, that constellation's over Antarctica.

419
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,510
他不可能从洛杉矶出发  在今天下午...
He's not going to get there today by 4:00 p.m....

420
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,110
4点之前到那
Not from L.A.

421
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,880
那么  我差一点死的毫无价值
So, I almost died for nothing.

422
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,330
-很高兴知道这点  -很多人都死了
-That's good to know. -A lot of people have died.

423

那是他们的问题  好吗
Well, that's their problem, okay,

424
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,310
因为用命去换这个垃圾的人

425
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,340
是傻蛋
Is a sucker.

426
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,340
因为你们根本赢不了
'cause you guys can't win!

427
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,840
再说那些死了的人
Say it about the people who died.

428
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,640
说啊

429

说啊
Say it.

430
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,150

起来

432
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,390
回你那呆电脑那  干你的事去
Get back on your nerd box and do your job.

433
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,240
我们可以在湖边找个地方
We can get a little place by the water.

434
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,220
这比你独自亡命天涯好多了
And you'd be better off not being on the run by yourself, either.

435
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,740
我替你保证过的  贝里克
I vouched for you, Bellick.

436
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,640
我跟迈克尔说过  布拉德帮我逃到芝加哥
I told Michael, "Brad I helped me get to Chicago.

437
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,410
他是个好人  相信他
He's a good guy, trust him."

438
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,910
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

439
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,400
现在当我们都有机会...
And now you just want to run...

440
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,240
洗脱罪名的时候  你只想着逃跑
When we have a chance to clear our names?

441
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,840
但这个情形可不乐观
Odds of that don't look so good.

442
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,030
油箱是满的  油门在右边
Tank's full, gas pedal's on the right.

443
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,410
我们可以逃离这里
I say we get the hell out of Dodge

444
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,510
现在  等我们过边境之后再担心...
right now, we can worry about the ankle bracelets...

445
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,310
脚踝跟踪器也不迟
Once we get over the border.

446
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,630
你给我听着
You listen to me.

447
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,140
我现在只关心一件事
There's only one thing I'm thinking about.

448
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,020
她重7磅  眼睛和她妈妈长得一样
She weighs seven pounds, has her mother's eyes.

449
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,110
她的小手心牵挂着我的心
And my heart in the palm of her tiny hands.

450
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,710
所以无论让我找1张卡
Oo if I have to find one card.

451
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,980
或是6张卡
Or six cards.

452
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,260
或是6百万张卡
Or six million cards.

453
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,740
我都会不顾一切的去找
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

454
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,510
因为我只抱过我的小乖女儿10秒钟...
'cause I only got to hold my baby girl for ten seconds...

455
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,180
那远远不够
And that wasn't nearly long enough.

456
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,780
你想干什么
What are you doing?

457
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,860
这家伙不会出现了
This guy ain't showing up.

458
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,360
把手举到我们能看到的地方
Hey, get your hands where we can see them!

459
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,540
举起手来  举起手来
Get your hands up! Get your hands up!

460
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,690
-老天  情况不妙  -举起手来
-Oh, my God, this ain't good. -Put your hands up.

461
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,740
我举起来了  我举起来了
I got them up, I got them up!

462
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,220
把手举起来  苏克雷  快点  老兄
Put your hands up, Sucre, come on, man.

463
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,460
-你打给谁?  -等等
-Who you calling? -Hold on.

464
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,620
他们会崩了你的
They're gonna shot you.

465
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,810
快点  把手举起来
Come on, put your hands up!

466
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,710
好了  好了  别开枪  别开枪
Okay, okay, don't shoot, don't shoot.

467
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,010
别开枪  伙计  我们什么都不会做的
Don't shoot, man, we're all right.

468
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,540
电脑挂了
Computer's frozen.

469
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,680
-什么叫挂了  -我不知道
-What do you mean, it's frozen? -I-I don't know.

470
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,520
就是没反应了
It's just not responding.

471
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,050
我都重启两次了  还是不好用
I've rebooted twice now. It's still not letting me on.

472
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,690
再试一下
Try again.

473
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,110
我试了中止路由  强行指令
Look, I've tried a stop route, a jock program.

474
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,630
甚至后门登陆  我是说  你蹲过监狱
Even a back-door entry, I mean, you were in prison.

475
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,720
我肯定你对这个很熟悉
I'm sure you're familiar with that one.

476
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,180
你想死吗
You want to stop breathing?

477
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,280
怎么了
What happened?

478
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,140
他们把我锁死了
They locked me out.

479
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,990
我告诉你  他们要放弃我们了
I'm telling you, they're shutting us down.

480
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,910
我们得走了  他们来了
We gotta go. They're coming after us. Whoa.

481
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,980
我们快走  快点  等等
We gotta go, let's go, come on. Whoa, whoa.

482
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,780
等等  如果我们逃跑  他们会干掉我们的
Wait a minute, we run, they shoot us!

483
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,240
那你留下
Stay.

484
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,660
-莎拉  -什么
-Sara? -Yeah.

485
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,540
我们快离开这里
Let's get out of here.

486
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,080
你说过我们有一天的时间的
You said we'd have until the end of today.

487
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,600
不  这件事已经不受我控制了
No, this goes way over my head.

488
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,170
听着  这个计划已经被终止了
Look, this project's been terminated.

489
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,110
现在停车  结束这一切
Now pull over and end this.

490
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,250
我们能完成任务
We can finish the job.

491
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,240
已经没有任务了  知道吗
There is no more job, okay?

492
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,310
如果这件事曝光  回监狱...
If you make this takedown public, going back to prison.

493
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,240
将是你们最好的结果了
Is going to be the least of your worries.

494
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,210
甩掉他
Lose him.

495
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,710
跟住他  跟住
Stay on him, stay on him.

496
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,620
我们上  我们上
Let's go, let's go!

497
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,180
这边  快
It's this way, go!

498
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,980
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

499
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,390
这里是伽特公司  需要什么帮忙吗
Thank you for calling GATE. How may I help you?

500
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,510
是的  你好  我叫科尔・普发
Yes, hi, my name is Cole Pfeiffer.

501
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,890
我想问问关于始发奖金的事
Uh, I'm calling about my, uh, commencement bonus.

502
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,710
我到现在还没有收到
I haven't received it yet, and, uh...

503
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,310
当然  普发先生
Oh, of course, Mr. Pfeiffer.

504
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,710
不过怀特先生现在不在
Um, Mr. White is out right now,

505
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,410
他肯定是非常不想错过您的电话的
But he's going to be so upset he missed your call.

506
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,740
我试试找一下他
Here, let me try to track him down.

507
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,610
不  不  不用麻烦了
Oh, no, no, don't bother.

508
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,080
你寄张支票给我就行了
Uh, maybe you just could, uh, uh, forward the check to me.

509
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,310
不行  支票都需要怀特先生亲自签发的
No, Mr. White has to sign off on any checks.

510
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,610
而且我知道他非常想和你谈谈
And I know that he really wants to talk to you.

511
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,820
我让他给您回电话
So can I have him reach you...

512
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,570
您看可以吗
At the number that came up on my I.D.?

513
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,300
非常期待
Looking forward to it.

514
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,780
你他妈的为什么要告诉赛尔夫...
Why the hell did you tell Self...

515
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,540
我们今天能找到一个持卡者
That we could get a cardholder by today?

516
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,620
是他这么要求的  阿历克斯
He set the terms, Alex!

517
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,540
我别无选择
I didn't have a choice!

518
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,850
现在我们都没有选择了
And now none of us have a choice.

519
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,910
我绝对不会回监狱
And I am not going back to prison.

520
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,980
我还需要去...
And I still have this that I need...

521
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,540
-绝不回去  -那你跑啊
-Not going back. -Go ahead and run!

522
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,620
伙计们  别吵了
Guys, stop.

523
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,040
脚腕上绑着这东西...
We ain't running anywhere...

524
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,680
我们跑哪都没有用  知道吗
With these things on our ankles, all right?

525
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,280
在那里
It's over here.

526
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,940
这边
It's this way.

527
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,760
等等
Wait a minute.

528
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,320
等等
Wait a second.

529
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,880
信号  信号没了
The signal...the signal's gone.

530
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,710
信号没了
The signal is gone.

531
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,690
他们跑哪去了
Where are they?

532
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,310
我们得找到信号  去找信号
Okay, we gotta go and get the signal, let's get the signal.

533
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,580
我们不能永远呆在这里
We cannot stay here forever.

534
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,510
他们肯定会找到的
They will eventually figure this out.

535
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,900
我不在乎这里能否阻止信号
I don't care if this place blocks the signal or not.

536
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,840
迈克尔  你在干嘛  伙计
Mike, what the hell are you doing, man?

537
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,820
我们没时间了
We don't have time for this.

538
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,460
答案就在这里  肯定在这里
The answers are in here, they have to be.

539
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,970
如果我能找到的话  也许我们还有机会
If I can just find them, we might have a chance.

540
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,480
这是广告  这些都是废话
It's an ad, the words don't make sense.

541
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,850
-都是胡扯  -没错  只有这样...
-It's gibberish. -Exactly, and that's what...

542
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,620
他们才能隐藏信息
Makes them ideal for hiding data.

543
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,150
别管那他妈的什么持卡者了
Forget about the damn cardholder.

544
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,930
赛尔夫已经不需要我们了
Self pulled the plug on us.

545
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,340
你没事吧
Are you okay?

546
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,110
是的  没事
Yeah, yeah.

547
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,710
我们会想出办法的
We're going to figure this out.

548
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,540
我们很擅长在绝境中脱身
We're getting good at pulling off the impossible.

549
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
妈的  我不是死而复生了吗  对吧
Hell, I came back from the dead, right?

550
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,310
这是什么
What is it?

551
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,510
你看到什么了
What do you see?

552
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,470
是放在一起看的
They go over each other.

553
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,480
发电厂
Power plant.

554
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,510
新港海滩
New beach.

555
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,410
新港海滩那有座发电厂
There's a power plant in Newport Beach.

556
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,580
那就是会面的地点
That's your meeting.

557
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,580
现在到下午4点时间不多了
We ain't got long until 4:00.

558
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,310
我们怎么才能从这逃出去
How the hell are we going to get out of here?

559
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,290
你能跑多快
How fast can you run?

560
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,830
有信号了吗
Have you got the signal?

561
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,590
是的  他们向西面跑了  四个街区
Yeah, they are heading west, four blocks.

562
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,690
走
Go!

563
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,430
让开  妈的
Move, damn it.

564
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,810
-干嘛  -下车
-What? -Get out of the cab.

565
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,180
你想干嘛
What hell do you think you're doing?

566
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,630
你好
Hello?

567
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,660
科尔・普发  我是格里高里・怀特
Cole Pfeiffer, Gregory White here.

568
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,560
抱歉打扰你了  先生  我打电话是想...
Oh, sorry to disturb you, sir, I was just calling.

569
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,600
询问一下奖金的事情
Bbout the, the bonus stipend.

570
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,070
打扰  你在说什么啊  孩子
Bother me? What are you talking about, son?

571
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,360
我非常高兴终于能...
I'm just thrilled to finally be able...

572
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,810
听见你的声音了  更好的是...
To put a voice to the e-mail, and better yet...

573
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,240
我终于能和你见面交谈了
I'm going to be able to put a face to the voice.

574
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,240
是的  因为我们还没见过面
Right, because we haven't met yet.

575
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,570
是的  这简直是罪过  我的朋友
Yes, and that is a crime, my friend.

576
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,440
我得告诉你  伽特公司这里有很多人...
I gotta tell you, there are a lot of people over here...

577
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,240
都非常期待能够和你见面
At GATE who are very excited about meeting you.

578
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,840

579
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,300
我希望在走之前能同你见面
I'd love to see you before I go.

580

你明天一早就来伽特公司如何
So why don't you come to GATE first thing in the morning?

581
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,570
我想我们可以从...
I think we can all learn something...

582
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,750
东北区的销售冠军那里学到一些东西
From the number one salesman in the entire Northeast Region.

583
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,210
这就是伽特公司教会我们的东西
Weit...it's what GATE teaches.

584
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,050
通过你的知识...
"You can unshackle others...

585
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,700
来帮被束缚的人解脱
With the keys of knowledge."

586
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,430
这就是我要分享的东西
It...I...it's what I'm here to share,

587
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,290
这就是我知道的  也是我想分享的
It's what I know, it's what I want to give back.

588
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,190
瞧  这就是我开这家公司的目的
See, that's why I started this company.

589
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,070
让人们可以摆脱消极的束缚
So that people can avoid "The Captivity of Negativity."

590
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,330
向您致敬  怀特先生
Amen to that, Mr. White.

591
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,640
我得走了  我还要赶顿午餐
Now I gotta go, I've got a lunch.

592
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
不过明天一早我们在伽特公司见

593

598
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,140
真是个奇怪的见面地点
Strange place for a meeting.

599
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,700
有些神神秘秘  你不这样觉得吗
A little cloak-and-dagger, don't you think?

600
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,340
一如既往  塔克豪恩  一如既往
Belts and suspenders, Stuart, belts and suspenders.

601
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,510
为什么是老挝

602
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,520
医生第一次不会去解剖人的尸体
A doctor doesn't perform his first dissection on a human cadaver.

603

首先从青蛙开始  然后是猪

604
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,840
然后某天  就是人了

605
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,810
老挝是我们的青蛙
Laos is our frog.

606
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,980
也许丹麦或者乍得会是我们的猪
Perhaps Denmark or Chad will be our pig.

607
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,680
然后  只要我们想  所有东西都是的尸体
After that, anything we want can be our cadaver.

608
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,410
好  我们去检查一下电站的另一面
All right, let's check on the other side of the complex.

619
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,720
举起手来  放在我能看到的地方
Hands up. Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

620
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,590
过来
Aah! Come on.

621
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,630
别跑  站住
Stop! Hold it!

622
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,510

把手放在我能看到的地方
Let's see your hands.

625
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,510
把他拷起来
Get him up.

626
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,680
斯科菲尔德跑了
Scofield ran.

627
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,410
不用多久就能抓到他的
Won't take long to find him.

628
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,650
你只是在做无用的拖延
You're just delaying the inevitable.

629
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,190
-不可避免事是锡拉的会面  -闭嘴
-What's inevitable is a meeting with Scylla. -Shut up!

630
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,270
把他押进车子
Put him in the car.

631
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,110
听着  我们看了塔克豪恩的掌上电脑
Listen. We went through Tuxhorn's pda.

632

他们在这幢楼的另一边碰头
They got a meeting on the other side of that building.

633
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,840
-结束了  -没有结束
-It's over. -It's not over.

634
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,140
结束了  林肯  好吗
It's over, Lincoln, okay?

635
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,250
我知道你希望成功
I know you wanted this to work out.

636
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,520
但现在我已经不能控制了
But it's beyond me now.

643
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,470
不  我是说  什么时候能得到结果
No. I mean, when do we see ramifications?

644
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,370
我告诉你  塔克豪恩
I'll tell you what, Stuart.

645
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,670
你应该关心的是千兆赫器和海底钻探
You worry about the gigahertz and the offshore drilling.

646
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,680
我来负责行动的事

653
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,790
听着  伙计  我们都是带徽章的人
Look, man, we both have worn the badge in our day.

654
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,470
我不能再被关起来了
I-i can't survive any more time in lock-up.

655
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,040
我们能不能想点办法
Can-can we please work something out?

656
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,070
不  你可以快点滚进车去  进去

-什么  -进去
-What? -Get in.

660
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,200
一定是在玩笑
You got to be kidding me.

661
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,650
是迈克尔
It's Michael.

662
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,210
别紧张
Easy.

663
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,500
我给过你一个很好的开始
I gave you a good enough head start.

664
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,720
你应该好好利用
Should have took advantage of it.

665
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,180
是啊  但那样我就无法给你这个了
Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been able to give you this.

666
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,930
看录像吧
Press the video function.

667
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:30,920
这不两个锡拉...
It wasn't a meeting...

668
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,700
持卡者的会面  赛尔夫特工
Between two Scylla cardholders, agent Self.

669
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,090
这是6个持卡者的会面

670
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,640
现在我们知道谁拥有其他5张卡了
So now we know who has the other five cards.

671
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,980
这该有所意义吧
And that should mean something.

672
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,370
即使对一个毫无话语权的人也是吧
Even to someone whose word means nothing.

673
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,380
我现在要给达洛参议员挂电话
I'm gonna call senator Dallo now.

674
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,860
但他听我的建议  当
But he follows my recommendations, Don.

675
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,380
下次你再逃跑的话
The next Time you run from me.

676
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,440
我不会再开车追你
I'm not gonna be chasing you down in a car.

677
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,700
我会一枪打死你

让他们走
Let them go.

680

带他们去仓库

所有的人
All of them.

682
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,040
是的  我是当・赛尔夫

683
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,440
我现在就要和他讲话

684
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,090
现在
Right now.

685
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,410
很快会有那么一天  我们会把你的小船开走

永远不再回来
In the water and disappear forever.

687
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,640
我保证
I promise.

688
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,010
那个孤僻先生要去哪
Hey, where's Mr. Personality going?

689
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,890
他们检查他的脚踝了吗  因为他一定...
They check his wrists? 'Cause he must...

690
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,310
别管他的事
Let him be.

691
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,780
不服从上级的命令  是吧
Insubordination's tiring, huh?

692
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,380
你何时学会直接给达洛参议员打电话了
Where the hell do you get off calling Senator Dallo directly?

693
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,110
你不能到我的地盘
You don't move into my city.

694
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,280
到我的办公室  就把我踩在脚下
Into my regional office and go over my head!

695
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,750
你要我怎么做
What do you want from me?

696
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,040
你知道游戏规则的  赫博
You know how it works, Herb.

697
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,680
你以为公司要杀你的时候
You think when the Company's breathing down your neck.

698
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,310
达洛参议员会出面救你吗
Senator Dallo's gonna bring in the cavalry?

699
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,880
他会假装从来不认识你
He'll pretend he's never even heard of you.

700
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,040
现在你只能靠自己了  赛尔夫
You're on your own from now on, Self.

701
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,860
你要孤军奋战了
You're an island.

702
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,410
如果我孤军奋战  你还在这干吗
If I'm an island, what are you doing here?

703
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,980
出去  让我把我的活干完
Get out of my office and let me finish what I started.

704

给你挖第一铲子土的
I'll be the first one there with a shovel.

莎拉・唐克雷蒂 ...
Sara Tancredi's...

708
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,740
在某个安全的地方对吗  布鲁斯
Somewhere safe, isn't she, Bruce?

709
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,050
你会保证她的安全的  对吗
You would have made sure of that, wouldn't you?

710
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,850
告诉我  莎拉在哪
So tell me, where is Sara?

711
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,980

洛杉矶的哪里
Where in Los Angeles?

716
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,380
我不知道
I don't know.

717
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,380
我不知道
I don't know.

718
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,970
我相信你

719
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,690
做的好
Good job.

720
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,300
野餐结束了  布鲁斯
Picnic's over, Bruce.

马宏怎么了
What's up with Mahone?

722
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,590
他们杀了他儿子
They murdered his son.

723
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,000
公司杀了他儿子...
The Company killed his son like...

724
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,510
就像他们曾经想要杀LJ那样
Like they tried to kill LJ.

725
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,520
阿历克斯  我...
Alex, I, uh...

726
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,510

00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,840
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,040
他们这么做
They did this...

729
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,050
是要找到我
To get to me.

730
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
逼我出来
To flush me out.

731

他们让我的前妻...
And then they let my ex-wife...

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,050
活着...
stay alive...

733

为了让她亲口告诉我  如果我不出现...
Just so she could tell me that she was next...

734
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,840
他们就杀了她
If I didn't turn myself in.

735
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,690
现在他们把她藏起来
Now she's in protective custody,

736
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,640
而我在这个破仓库里...
And I'm living in a warehouse trying to find...

737
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,190
想要找出是哪个混蛋杀了我儿子
