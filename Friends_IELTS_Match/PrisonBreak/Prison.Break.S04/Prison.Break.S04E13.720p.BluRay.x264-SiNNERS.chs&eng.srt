00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,140
这才是"锡拉"
This is Sylly

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,260
你们是出不去的
You are not even close to get out of here

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,600
-爸爸  是我  -丽莎

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,040
我在枪口上  是唐克雷蒂

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,430
她说  你要是不让迈克尔和其他人
She says if you don't,let Michael and the others

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,670
带着"锡拉"离开  她就杀了我
leave with Scylla, she'll kill me.

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,000
别动
Don't!

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,370
我要走了
I'm leaving.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,330
不  怀特先生
No, Mr. White!

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,030
转过去
Turn around!

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,900
轻点  甜心
Gentle now, sugar.

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,970
我是米里亚姆・贺尔兹探员  甜心
That's Special Agent Miriam Holtz to you, sugar.

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,170
我们拿到了
We have it!

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,770
他们拿到了
They got it.

17
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,900
我没想到 你能查到这么深
I never thought you'd make it this far.

18
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,030
我错了
I was wrong.

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,230
怎样
What now?

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,070
这是你们的迁移文件
This is all your transfer paperwork.

21
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,100
我得尽快赶到达洛斯那边去
I need to get to Dallow, ASAP.

22
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,270
格雷琴呢
What happened to Gretchen?

23
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,030
她跑了
She got away.

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,800
赛尔夫
Self.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,930
赛尔夫[又意:自私鬼]
Self.

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,600
他骗了我们
He screwed us.

27
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,100
赛尔夫不能这么做
Self can't do that.

28
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,600
他是政府人员  想干什么都行
He's government. He can do what he pleases.

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,970
车一定会来的
The vans are coming.

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,270
肯定是耽误了
They're just late.

31
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,530
他不会回来了
He ain't coming back!

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,130
你也不确定  林肯  他们会来的
You don't know that, Linc! They're coming!

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,930
我们现在怎么办
What do we do now?

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,430
给国安局打电话  看他们对赛尔夫了解多少
Call Homeland. See how much they know about Self.

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,500
斯坦顿
Stanton.

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,700
贺勃  是斯科菲尔德和布伦斯
Herb, it was Scofield and Burrows.

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,130
你在议员的办公室吗
Are you at the Senator's office?

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,330
我中枪了
I think I'm shot!

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,470
我中枪了
I'm shot!

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,270
米里亚姆也死了  你听见吗
Miriam's gone, okay?

41
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,430
你在什么地方
What's your position?

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,030
这整个行动 你说的是对的
You were right about this whole operation.

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,170
不要  布伦斯  布伦斯
No. Burrows, Burrows!

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,170
唐
Don.

45
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,500
不妙
No!

46
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,530
我要找格雷琴 你会帮我吗
I need to find Gretchen. You gonna help me?

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
否则  我让你脸上开花
Or you gonna make me shoot you in the face?

48
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,500
帮[又意:救命]
Help.

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,170
国土安全局
Department of Homeland Security.

50
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,030
我找唐・赛尔夫的上司  谢谢
I'd like to talk to Don Self's superior, please.

51
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,130
请稍等
One moment, please.

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,630
我们把价值一亿的东西 就这么拱手送给这家伙了
We gave this guy something worth $100 million.

53
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,730
他是国安局的吗  我们看过他的徽章吗
Is he even with Homeland? Did we see a badge?

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,830
他给了我们枪  用C-130运输机送我们过来
We were given guns and flown out on a C-130.

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,400
-他肯定不是车管局的 -这也不代表他是合法的
He didn't work for the DMV. That doesn't make him the law.

56
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,670
不  不能
No, it don't.

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,400
要是国安局从一开始就参与了呢
What if Homeland was in on this from the beginning?

58
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,330
我是贺勃・斯坦顿  你是谁
This is Herb Stanton. Who is this?

59
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,330
喂
Hello?

60
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,170
我搞不清赛尔夫是怎么设的局
The way Self played this, I don't know.

61
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,570
他一直让自己置身事外
He kept himself too insulated.

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,700
这就是为什么 需要政府授权时
That's why, that's why he hesitated with official authorizations

63
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,530
他总是犹豫 他总是说  这是为了防止
on behalf of our mission. He kept saying it was because he didn't want

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
"公司"发现  而实际上
the Company to find out. In actuality,

65
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,700
他是不想让人发现他的诡计
it's because he didn't want to get caught,

66
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,900
狗娘养的
the son of a bitch!

67
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,170
他部署周密 让我们去承担责任
He kept the circle tight. Left the rest of us holding the bag.

68
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,000
如果国安局知道我们在哪 他们迟早会来抓我们
If Homeland knows where we're at. Sooner or later they're coming for us.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,070
让他们来吧 我们又没做错什么  我们有协议的
Let them come. we didn't do anything wrong. We have deals.

70
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,530
不  我们只有白纸  赛尔夫留给我们的
No, we have paper. That's what Self left us.

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,570
我们只有这些
That's what we have.

72
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,570
我们得离开这里
We gotta get out of here.

73
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,530
我们不能走  迈克尔需要做手术
We can't leave. Michael needs surgery.

74
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,830
我说的不是逃跑
I'm not talking about running.

75
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,300
我说的是活命
I'm talking about surviving.

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,330
我想要的是目睹"公司"土崩瓦解
What I want is to see the Company burned to the ground

77
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,630
而你  锒铛入狱
and you in prison.

78
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,070
这是我们干的  我们干的
We did this to you. We did this to you.

79
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,770
他们正在楼下等你  长官
They're ready for you downstairs, sir.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,600
今天是我们所有努力的关键时刻
Today marks a critical juncture in our endeavor.

81
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,500
有没有"锡拉"的蛛丝马迹
Do we have a bead on Scylla yet?

82
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,300
我们的安全和未来  均命悬一线
Our security, our future stands at a great precipice.

83
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,370
到底有还是没有  乔纳森
It's a yes-or-no question, Jonathan.

84
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,300
我们不想听你自言自语
And we don't need a soliloquy.

85
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,430
霍华德  你去我办公室等我
Howard, why don't you wait in my office?

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,700
不  我来此 是确保这次行动不会再出差错
No. I'm in here making sure this operation isn't fumbled as well.

87
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,270
马上出去
Out... now.

88
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,800
你有什么计划  乔纳森
What's your plan, Jonathan?

89
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,670
我们来不就是为了这个吗
That's what we're all here for, right?

90
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,330
你不听我们的箴言 执意转移"锡拉"  如今弄巧成拙
You tried to move Scylla over our better judgment, and it backfired,

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,170
就认了吧
so spill it.

92
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,830
还有其他问题吗
Any further questions?

93
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,000
很好
Very well.

94
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,400
你们都知道自己的任务了
You have your assignments.

95
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,530
竭尽所能  今天就把"锡拉"找回来
Access your assets and retrieve Scylla today.

96
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,370
赛尔夫探员  过去几个月里
Yeah, well, a lot of people that believed in me

97
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,900
很多相信我的人 现在都死了
in the last few months, Agent Self, not all of them are alive today.

98
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,170
我不明白这句话
I can't shake that line.

99
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,030
"走为上策"
"All that avails is flight."

100
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,330
起来
Come on.

101
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,300
给  拿着
Here, take that.

102
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,000
莎拉是对的  我们得送你去医院
Sara's right. We need to get you to a hospital now.

103
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,270
我们就差那么一点 就那么一点
We were so close to the finish line. So close.

104
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,730
我知道  我明白
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

105
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,470
我昨天给LJ打了电话 告诉他一切都接近尾声了
Listen, I, uh, I spoke to LJ yesterday. Told him this was almost over.

106
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,930
我要对我儿子信守诺言
I'm keeping my word to my son, Michael.

107
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,600
我早该发现这个阴谋
I should have seen this coming.

108
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:19,130
不  这不是任何人的错 是赛尔夫耍了我们
No, no, it's no one's fault. Self played all of us.

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,330
我们得离开这里 这是我们最后的选择
We gotta get out of here. This is our last option.

110
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,370
好的
Yeah.

111
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,700
-查看楼上  -安全
Take upstairs.Clear.

112
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,700
安全
It's clear.

113
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,300
现在知道我们的处境了
Now we know where we stand.

114
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,130
走吧
Let's go.

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
喂
Hello.

116
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,870
迈克尔・斯科菲尔德
Michael Scofield.

117
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,030
是的
Yes.

118
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,070
我是贺勃・斯坦顿  国土安全局的
Herb Stanton, Department of Homeland Security.

119
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,970
我们想谈谈
We want to talk.

120
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,800
你们能不能回仓库
Can you please come back to the warehouse?

121
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,870
没问题  但首先得给我们一些保障
All right, but first we're gonna need some assurances.

122
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,700
你指什么
What kind of assurances?

123
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,670
我们遵守了我们的诺言
Look, we held up our end of the deal,

124
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,530
所以  我们要你 履行协议里的条件
so we're gonna need you to honor the terms of our agreements.

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,570
那我得重新看一下那些条件
Well, I'd have to take another look at those terms,

126
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,830
但我确定里面不包括偷走"锡拉"
but I'm fairly certain it didn't include stealing Scylla

127
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,900
和冷血杀害两名联邦探员
or killing two federal agents in cold blood.

128
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,770
你这话是什么意思
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,970
我给你们准备了 一些新的条件
Here are the new terms I'm prepared to offer.

130
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,200
回来  自首
Come back, turn yourselves in...

131
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,270
等等  是赛尔夫算计了我们
Wait a minute! Self set us up!

132
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,500
否则 我会追捕你们到天涯海角
Don't, and I'll hunt you down like animals.

133
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,030
我们照他们说的做了
We did what they said.

134
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,770
我不想再背捏造的谋杀罪了
I ain't going down on some trumped-up murder charge.

135
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,430
赛尔夫把两起谋杀案扣到我们头上
Self pinned two murders on us.

136
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,700
你在干嘛  林肯
What are you doing, Linc?

137
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,200
如果国安局的人来了 我们能摆平
If Homeland Security comes... Then we'll handle it.

138
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,470
你要知道 总有划清界线的限度
You know what? There's gotta be a point where you draw the line.

139
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,800
现在就是时候了
Now's the time to draw that line.

140
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,530
林肯  别傻了  你对付不了整个国安局的
Linc,don't be stupid. You can't fight off all of Homeland.

141
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,230
听政府的鬼话才是最傻的
Stupid is listening to the government.

142
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,230
我可不想再回死囚区了
I ain't going back to death row,Doc.

143
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,630
我们还能遵守诺言
We can still hold onto our deals.

144
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,400
只要揪出赛尔夫  证明他拿了"锡拉"
All we have to do is flush Self out, prove he has Scylla.

145
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,900
我们怎么做呢
How are we gonna do that, huh?

146
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,430
我们得想个新策略
We have to devise another strategy.

147
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,800
我们应该想个计划
We should start devising a plan

148
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,690
把我们送出墨西哥边境几英里外
that can get us a hundred miles across the Mexican border.

149
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,300
那才是我们该做的
That's what we should do.

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,990
我稍后回电话
I'll call back.

296
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,790
现在  关于这位斯坦顿先生
Now, about this Mr. Stanton...

297
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,020
阿历克斯  情况如何
Alex, how are you doing?

298
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,690
还没有格雷琴的迹象
No sign of Gretchen yet.

299
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,820
林肯
Linc?

300
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,220
没有格雷琴的迹象
No sign of Gretchen.

301
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,820
苏克雷
Sucre?

302
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,720
她还没来  兄弟
She ain't here yet, bro.

303
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,790
莎拉
Sara?

304
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,790
没发现
All clear.

305
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,020
好了  守株待兔
All right, here we go.

306
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,920
够了
That's far enough.

307
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,850
够了
Ah... that's far enough.

308
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,890
对不起  丽塔
I'm sorry, Rita.

309
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,150
我保证不会有事的
I promise everything is going to be okay.

310
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,620
没错  我们都是朋友  丽塔
Yeah, we're all friends here,Rita.

311
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,190
完全不必担心
Don't worry about a thing.

312
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,520
你让冯来抓我  差点让我丧命
You know, sending Feng after me almost cost me my life,

313
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,350
也打破了我的计划  所以我才找你来
and it did cost me my plan, which is why you're here,

314
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,290
格雷琴 你得帮我找个新买家 买"锡拉"
Gretchen. You're going to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.

315
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,620
你跟斯科菲尔德他们通过电话呢
You've been talking to Scofield and the boys, huh?

316
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,350
他们怎样
Yeah, how are they?

317
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,720
他们很生气
Good and pissed.

318
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,890
他们在哪
Yeah, where are they?

319
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,350
唐  我不知道  我又不是他们老妈
Gee, Don, I don't know, I'm not their mother.

320
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,220
你不是他们老妈
You're not their mother,

321
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:19,820
但是 她和你长得很像 不是吗
but... She looks just like you. Doesn't she?

322
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,790
她有一双大大的蓝眼睛
She's... got those big blue eyes.

323
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,750
我半小时后要和他们碰面
I'm supposed to meet them in a half an hour.

324
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,150
给国安局打个小报告
Get ready to phone in a tip to homeland.

325
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,620
在哪见面
Where at?

326
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,620
在哪
Where?

327
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,490
迈克尔  开展这次行动
To perform the operation,  Michael,

328
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,120
大概需要 20个部门的头头签名
that would require signatures from about 20 different department heads.

329
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,620
唯一可行的方法 是暗中进行
The only way this is going to work is via freelancer, off the books.

330
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,290
我应该感谢你们
I should be thanking you.

331
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,020
由于你们的功劳 生活将从此改变
Okay, because of what you've done, lives are going to be changed forever.

332
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,290
斯科菲尔德  重新考虑了我的条件吗
Scofield, have you reconsidered my offer?

333
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,650
如果我把赛尔夫和"锡拉"都交给你
If I get you Self and if I can get you Scylla,

334
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,990
你会不会遵守之前的诺言
are you going to be able to hold up our deals?

335
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,950
你怎么会有这种想法
How do you intend on doing that?

336
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,450
我们一直努力这么做
Well, that's what we're working on.

337
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,350
联调局的人来了
The feds, they're here.

338
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,350
这是陷阱
We were set up.

339
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,190
把手举起来
Hands where I can see them!

340
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,920
杀害两名联邦探员
Killing two federal agents ought to put you back

341
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,120
足够判你死刑  布伦斯先生
on top of Death Row, Mr. Burrows.

342
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,050
我们没杀任何人 是赛尔夫在操纵
We didn't kill anyone. Self's behind this.

343
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,280
唐・赛尔夫 是一位称职的探员和高尚的公民
Don Self, is a decorated agent and an honorable man.

344
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,580
对
Yeah.

345
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,450
你不是第一个坐在椅子上
You wouldn't be the first guy to sit in that chair

346
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
试图蒙蔽我的人
and try to sell me a bill of goods.

347
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,450
你们把事情弄清时
Why weren't we halfway to Mexico

348
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,750
我们怎么没在去墨西哥的路上
by the time you worked things out?

349
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,320
-你们疏忽了  -不是
-You slipped up.  -No.

350
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,620
因为我们跟你一样被蒙在鼓里
Because we were in the dark just as much as you were.

351
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
布伦斯  我们清楚发生了什么事
We know what happened, Burrows.

352
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,180
你没有把事情联系起来
You're not putting this together.

353
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,950
想想"锡拉"值多少钱
Think about how much Scylla's worth.

354
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,380
想想赛尔夫隐蔽 这一切的尺度
Think of the lengths that Self went to to keep this thing...

355
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,680
一切暗中进行
to keep this thing off the books.

356
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,180
我们呢  我们所有人 努力完成任务
And us? Us, of all people, pulling this job off.

357
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,750
尸体在哪
Where are the bodies?

358
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,580
只要五分钟  不要想我们
For five minutes, stop thinking about us,

359
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,820
想想赛尔夫
and focus on Self!

360
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,080
我们为什么不珍视自由
Why would we jeopardize our freedom?

361
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,780
那是我们一直以来唯一在乎的东西
It's the only thing we've ever cared about!

362
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,980
费尔南多在哪
Where's Fernando?

363
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,150
他在路上
He's on his way.

364
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,350
迈克尔  我局里还有个朋友
Michael, look, I still have a friend in the Bureau

365
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,720
我们可以找她
we can reach out to.

366
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,650
也许她能找出 林肯关在什么地方
Maybe she can make some calls, see where they're holding Linc.

367
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,180
你打给谁
Who are you calling?

368
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,980
是斯科菲尔德
It's Scofield.

369
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,850
那就接吧
All right. So answer it.

370
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,020
之前有机会 我就应该打爆你的头
I should have put a bullet in your face  when I had the chance.

371
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,280
迈克尔  不是我陷害你
I'm not the one who set you up, Michael.

372
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,880
那是谁
Yeah? Who did?

373
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,350
迈克尔  我之前说的都是真的
You know, I meant what I said before, Michael.

374
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,980
我喜欢你做事的方式
I like your style. Okay?

375
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,420
你聪明过人
You're a smart guy.

376
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,250
只可惜  我比你更聪明一点
Unfortunately for you, I'm just a little bit smarter.

377
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,920
是吗  我们等着瞧
Yeah? We'll see about that.

378
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,150
听说国安局的人去了广场吧
I heard Homeland made a surprise visit to the plaza, huh?

379
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,480
我给你点临行建议 逃跑
Look, I'm going to give you some parting advice. Run.

380
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,320
带上你的同伴开始逃跑吧
Okay, get your pals and just start running.

381
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,650
我们得走了  迈克尔  得走了
We gotta go. Michael, we gotta go.

382
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,820
感谢你的帮助
I appreciate all your help, all right?

383
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,250
我现在要把"锡拉"卖了
I'm going to sell Scylla now.

384
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,550
唐  你哪也去不了
Don, you're not going anywhere.

385
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,380
是吗
Really? Okay.

386
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,580
谁是买家
Who's the buyer?

387
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,450
他叫怀肯
His name is Vikan.

388
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,620
他不是买家  他只是个中间人
And he's not a buyer. He's a conduit.

389
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,050
谁的中间人
A conduit to what?

390
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,780
我们可不是转移海洛因到这里
We're not exactly moving heroin here.

391
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,720
这个更特殊
It's a little bit more specialized.

392
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,180
世上大概有五个人
There's about five people in the world

393
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,780
知道"锡拉"的用途且愿意购买
who know what do with Scylla and are willing to pay for it.

394
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,580
行  我们走
All right. Let's go.

395
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,080
巴格维尔待在这里
Bagwell's staying here.

396
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,080
如果你动她们任何一个
You're going to find yourself captive in my negativity

397
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,020
我就不放过你
if you lay a hand on either one of them.

398
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,280
我警告过你不要惹我
I warned you not to screw me over.

399
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,480
你怎能这样
How could you?

400
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,620
我很快就回来
I'll be back very, very soon.

401
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,250
我保证  他不会伤害你
And I promise you, that man is not going to hurt you.

402
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,320
你怎能这样
How could you?

403
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,620
我会解决的
I'm going to fix this.

404
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,650
格雷琴  你真是
Wow, Gretchen, you're making friends

405
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,150
左右逢源啊
left and right, huh?

406
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,950
走吧
Now move your ass.

407
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,080
我们查了赛尔夫的出国鉴定
We've accessed Self's E.I.D.

408
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,020
找到了他试图删除的文件
We've been able to get to files he tried to delete.

409
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,120
我们更清楚地认识到
They're giving us a lot clearer picture

410
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,180
他的为人  他的企图
of who he is and what he's been up to.

411
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,380
很高尚  对吧
Honorable, huh?

412
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,320
你发现了什么
What did you find out?

413
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,980
一个名字  罗伯特・沃克
A name. Robert Walker.

414
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,680
赛尔夫打算用的新身份
The new identity Self is planning on using.

415
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,550
我们发现一个社保号
We found a Social Security number,

416
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,080
开曼的银行账号和信用卡
a bank account in the Caymans, credit cards

417
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,220
还有一个明早去那里的
and a flight itinerary

418
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,580
航班旅行指南
out of the country for tomorrow morning.

419
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,480
所以
So,

420
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,680
首先  我们向你道歉
first of all, we owe you an apology.

421
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,920
其次  我们抓住他时
And, second, when we finally get our hands on him,

422
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,880
重要的是你的帮助
it's going to be paramount to get your help.

423
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,220
怎么帮
How?

424
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,380
你的证词
Your testimony,

425
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,020
还有你弟弟
and the testimony of your brother

426
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,680
及其他人的证词
and the others against Self

427
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,520
来交换全部豁免权  你们就可以离开
in exchange for full immunity. You walk away.

428
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,480
我们已经说好的
We already had a deal.

429
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,850
如果你现在离开  就没有人讲清整个事件
If you walk now, there'll be no one left to tell the tale.

430
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,520
国安局会需要你们来掩盖事实
DHS needs you to cover its ass.

431
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,480
我们不能浪费时间去追捕你朋友
We can't spend our time chasing your friends.

432
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,780
他们得过来
They need to come in

433
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,880
我们才能商讨细节
so we can work out the details.

434
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,280
如果他们不来呢
What if they don't?

435
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,480
我们不敢再相信任何人了
We got a whole bunch of trust issues.

436
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,550
那你们只能在监狱里抑郁而终
Then, you'll all rot in a Supermax prison.

437
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,080
国安局会准备揭开事情真相
DHS is prepared to fly into the face of this thing

438
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,720
或隐瞒一切
or to bury it.

439
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,480
你来选择  布伦斯先生
It's your choice, Mr. Burrows.

440
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,420
这是你们最好的出路
This is the best you're gonna do.

441
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,420
迈克尔
Michael.

442
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,150
林肯  你在哪
Linc, where are you?

443
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,580
在仓库里
In the warehouse.

444
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,920
开扩音器
Put me on speaker.

445
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,920
国安局知道赛尔夫陷害了我们
Homeland knows self screwed us.

446

他们找到了他没有销毁掉的文件

448

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,020
一张离开这里的单程机票

450
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,320
结束了
So it's over.

对

如果我们指证赛尔夫  就能豁免

453
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,620
豁免什么罪

454
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,280
我们已经完成了
We... we did the job

455

他们交的任务

456

迈克尔  我是康拉德・达洛斯议员

好  我决定

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,720
或者说  我认为我们应该听议员的
Rather, I think that, uh, we should hear the senator out.

462
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,020
而且
And, uh,

463
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,820
如果进展不顺
If everything goes south, then I do

464
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,980
我也有后备计划
Have a backup plan.

465
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,750
苏克雷  我希望你和莎拉一起

去碰面地点密切注视着

467
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,650
阿历克斯和我会确定
Alex and I are gonna make sure they don't bring

468
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,850
他们没有耍诈
Any surprises by doubling back

469
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,050
回到仓库
To the warehouse

470
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,650
然后跟他们去约定地点
And then following them to the rendezvous.

471
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,580
这是和议员见面的地点
This is where we're meeting the senator.

472
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,880
好吗
All right?

473
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,080
没问题
We'll be there.

474
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,520
我父亲大部分的政治生涯
You know, my father spent most of his political life...

475
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,820
都在伸张正义
Chasing justice.

476
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,920
就像某种强迫症
It was sort of an obsession.

477
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,880
母亲和我无法理解
And my mother and I could never understand

478
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,850
他为何如此轻易地
Why he would so easily

479
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,220
把别人的事情揽上身
Make other people's problems his own.

480
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,750
我想这也是她离开他的原因
And I think it's why she left him.

481
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,430
迈克尔  这些天
And, michael, you remind me

482
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,380
你不断让我想起他
more and more of him these days.

483
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,480
你总是把别人的事看得
The way you put everybody else's problems

484
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,820
比自己的还重要
Before your own.

485
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,080
就是说
That said...

486
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,850
我想让你知道
...i want you to know that,

487
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,340
如果和达洛斯议员的会面
if this meeting with senator dallow

488
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,350
没能如你所愿
doesn't go the way you want it to,

489
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,720
你不用担心我们的事
You don't have to worry about you and I.

490
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,620
没有什么
Nothing's...

491
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,750
没有什么能拆散我们
...nothing's gonna come between us.

492
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,950
对
Yeah.

493
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,680
一切都会好的  对吗
And everything is gonna be okay, right?

494
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,150
我想明白了
You know, I've figured it out.

495
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,950
国安局一开始对你糖衣炮弹
Dhs wined and dined you in the beginning

496
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,280
许你整个世界
And promised you the world,

497
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,580
完成之后 把你和一个傻子
And then they ultimately settled

498
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,580
扔到扫帚柜
On a broom closet

499
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,850
你就反口了
And you said nil.

500
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,180
格雷琴  你观察很敏锐
Gretchen, you have a real keen sense of perception.

501
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,320
很惊人
It's amazing.

502
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,250
而一切结束后
And this all ends

503
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,580
住塔希提岛的三层小屋  对吗
With a three-story hut in tahiti, right?

504
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:30,980
纯平电视  室外有摩托艇
Flat-screen tv, a couple jet skis outside.

505
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,280
唐  但你会发现
But what you're gonna find, don,

506
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,080
当这一切结束了
Is that when the rush is over

507
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,620
你不会受到任何赞誉
And you're done patting yourself on the back

508
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,420
也没有人给你倾诉
And there's no one left to tell the story to,

509
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,720
你会一如既往地孤独
You'll be just as alone as you are now.

510
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,780
这才是唐・赛尔夫的面目
That's who don self is.

511
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,220
是吗
Is that right?

512
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,150
你说呢
You tell me.

513
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
喂

00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,950
拿出枪
Take out your gun.

515
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,650
怎么了
What's going on?

516
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,080
巴格维尔  你还要不要你那份钱
You want a cut or not, bagwell?

517
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,080
拿出枪
Take out your gun.

518
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,150
唐  放松点
Relax, don.

519
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,320
好了
All right.

520
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,020
瞄准她的头
Point it at her head.

521
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,450
唐

522
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
拉枪栓
Pull back the hammer.

523
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,520

今天之内我要上飞机
And I want to be on a plane by the end of today.

526
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,820
否则  你和你的家人会发现
Otherwise, you and your family are gonna find out

527
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,980
唐・赛尔夫的真面目
Who the real don self is,

528
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,180
-明白吗  -是他
You understand me? that's him.

529
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,480
-明白了吗  -我们约好了
Do you understand me? we're set.

东七街  1714号
1714 east seventh street.

535
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,220
不对啊
This can't be right.

536
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,850
你确定他是这样写的吗
You sure this is what he wrote down?

537
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
是这样写的
That's what it says.

538
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,920
是个停车场
It's a parking lot.

539
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,650
迈克尔为什么要选这里
Why would michael pick here?

540
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,120
我以为你和迈克尔
I thought you and michael

他很安全  迈克尔很安全
He's safe. michael's safe.

545
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,350
我们无法单独完成任务
We're not gonna be able to do this alone.

546
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,050
他在完成自己的任务
He's doing what he has to do,

547
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,220
我们也要完成自己的任务
And we have to do our part.

548
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,420
现在  我们上那辆公车
Right now, that's getting on that bus

迈克尔在哪
Where is michael?

554
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
斯科菲尔德先生

贺勃・斯坦顿
Herb stanton.

556

免了  我是来给证词的

560
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,550
之后就和我哥哥一起离开
And then I'm leaving with my brother.

561
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,580
这边坐
Right over here.

562
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,950
好的  先生们  告诉我们你们知道的
All right, gentlemen, tell us what you know.

563
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,850
去往贝克斯菲尔和弗雷斯诺的
Bus 34 with service to bakersfield

564
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,220
34路车现在五号站台上车
And fresno now boarding in terminal five.

565
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,050
我们真的要离开吗
Are we really leaving?

566
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,420
你听到马宏说的了
You heard mahone.

567
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,920
这是迈克尔的主意
This is what michael wants.

568
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,020
没错
Yeah, right.

569
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,920
但如果和达洛斯的交易是合法的
Okay, but if the deal with Dallow is legit,

570
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,320
就没理由逃跑了  对吧
there's no reason to run, right?

571
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,120
迈克尔只是想保护我们
Michael's just covering the bases,

572
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,580
确保我们不会有麻烦
making sure that we don't run into trouble again.

573
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,760
对  但如果他遇到麻烦
Yes, but if he's in trouble,

574
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,750
会需要我们的帮助
he's going to need our help.

575
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,350
也许他觉得我们也不能做些什么了
Well, maybe he thinks there's nothing left for us to do.

576
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,320
我们现在走  就等于丢下他
If we leave now, we're leaving him behind.

577
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,550
我没想到唐・赛尔夫隐瞒了一切
I didn't know Don Self had it in him.

578
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,020
我们现在知道他是幕后黑手
Now that we know he's behind this,

579
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,320
形式更严峻
our situation's a lot worse.

580
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,880
我们别再说什么事业了
We're not talking about our careers anymore.

581
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,980
现在真的是牢狱之灾了
We're talking about real jail time.

582
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,880
我们未经国会批准
We get 15 years just for conducting

583
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,980
擅自组织行动  会判15年
an unauthorized operation without Congressional approval.

584
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,180
或者完全免除
Or not.

585
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,880
没必要再谈什么封锁遏制了
This doesn't have to be about containment anymore.

586
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,620
可以斩草除根
It could be about excision.

587
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,580
你意下如何  议员
You all right with that, Senator?

588
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,150
那让他们去吧
Then they all go.

589
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,250
其他人呢
Where are the others?

590
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,950
马宏  苏克雷  唐克雷蒂
Mahone, Sucre, Tancredi.

591
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,350
他们不会来
They're not coming.

592
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,550
林肯和我会作证  但其他人
Linc and I will testify, but the others...

593
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,250
我们全部豁免
Well, we all get immunity.

594
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,380
就这些条件
Those are the terms.

595
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,080
我们的证词就能把赛尔夫定罪
Our testimony alone will put Self away.

596
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,980
先生  我们要结束这一切
Gentleman, we can't have the others running around

597
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,880
就不能让他们在外逃窜
while we're trying to wrap this up.

598
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,880
能打他们打电话吗  叫他们过来
Can we call 'em? Can we get 'em here?

599
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,720
交易对象是你们所有人  这才是条件
The deal was for all of you.  Those were the terms.

600
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,950
不是全部人  就免谈
Without everybody, this is no deal.

601
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,450
听着  你们会如愿的  好吧
Listen, pal, you're gonna get what you want, all right?

602
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,120
你打不打电话给他们
Are you gonna call them or not?

603
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,250
根本没有交易  对吧  议员
Hmm, there never was a deal, was there, Senator?

604
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,720
我希望能给你更好的答案  迈克尔
I wish I could give you a better answer, Michael,

605
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,520
但唐・赛尔夫留下很多烫手山芋
but Don Self left a lot of rough edges.

606
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,620
我们得全部摆平
We have to smooth them out.

607

告诉我  他们在哪
You want to tell me where they are?

608
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,320
我们不会说的
It ain't gonna happen.

609
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,950
我能帮你抓到赛尔夫
I can get you Self.

610
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,480
我也能帮你拿到"锡拉"
I can still get you Scylla.

611
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,020
"锡拉"  我们不谈"锡拉"
Scylla? Oh, we're past Scylla.

612
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,580
在弄回"锡拉"和现在了结之间选择
Between getting it back and ending this now,

613
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,150
已经很简单了
the choice is simple.

614

现在就给你案件的答案  理查德

621
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,780
将军要见你们

623

在这等

624

久违了  格雷琴
Been a long time, Gretchen.

625
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,280
不为将军卖命了吗
No longer working for the General?

626
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,910
没错
Correct.

627
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,850
他是谁

628
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,710
"锡拉"在我手里
I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.

629
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,350
有兴趣吗
You interested?

630
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,750
将军可给了一笔赏金
Well, the General has offered a reward for anyone

631
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,010
奖赏能把"锡拉"
who can return Scylla

632
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,950
和叛徒的人头带回去的人
along with the heads of the transgressors.

633
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
我很感激你给我机会

634
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,410
打击一下将军

所有人

637

苏特  拜托  我不会把你说出去
Sooter, please, I can give you cover.

638
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,480
省省吧  议员
Save it! Save it, Senator, save it.

639
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,780
将军特别交待要把你活着带过去
The General specifically asked that I bring you in alive.

640
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,180
快走
Just move.

641
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,410
你差点害死我们  议员
You were going to kill us, Senator.

642
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,010
是斯坦顿打的电话

一个跑了  我是另一个

我会守口如瓶
And I'm not saying a word.

649
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,250
你休想轻易脱身  议员
You're not getting off that easy, Senator.

650
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,380
你要帮我们
You are going to help us.

651
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,810
会议桌上有个手提包

00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,310

一旦你们把它处理掉

如果你们想要
