《越狱》第四季 第四集
Prison.Break.S04E04

2
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,660
《越狱》剧情回顾
Previously on Prison Break.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,260
他们称它锡拉
They refer to it as "Scylla."

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,660
是一本"公司"的黑皮书
It's like the company's black book.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,200
那是什么  可以在十码内获取
What's that? Wireless hard drive that swallows up

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,130
任何电子信息的无线硬盘
any electronic data within ten feet of it.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,960
能接收储存在锡拉里的信息吗
And the information embedded in Scylla?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,700
如果靠得够近的话
If we can get close enough...

9
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,460
就能得到了
it's ours.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,160
如果锡拉是一张饼
If Scylla was like a pizza,

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,530
我们只得到了一块
all we got's a slice.

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,330
锡拉不只一张卡
So Scylla isn't one card,

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,630
是六张
it's six.

14
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,000
他们杀了我儿子
They killed my boy.

15
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,500
我要找出谁是干的
I need to find out who did it.

16
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,630
婊子  天亮了
Rise and shine, bitch.

17
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,430
吃早饭了
Breakfast.

18
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,730
喂
Hello?

19
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,530
科尔・普发
Cole Pfeiffer,

20
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,700
我是  格里高里・怀特
Gregory White here.

21
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,800
我会明天早上在伽特公司见你
I'll see you at GATE first thing tomorrow.

22
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,100
而且  我会亲自给你
And I will personally hand you

23
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,460
你的花红支票
your bonus check.

24
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,930
莎拉・唐克雷蒂在很安全的地方
Sara Tancredi's

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
是不是 布鲁斯
somewhere safe, ist she, Bruce?

26
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,700
告诉我  莎拉在什么地方
So tell me, where is Sara?

27
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,400
洛杉矶
Los Angeles?

28
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,300
干得好
Good job.

29
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,300
这不仅是两个锡拉持卡人
It wasn't a meeting

30
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,700
会面  赛尔夫探员
between two Scylla cardholders, Agent Self.

31
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,100
所有
It was a meeting

32
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,700
六个持卡人都在那儿
between all six cardholders.

33
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,330
所以我们已经知道
So now we know who has the other

34
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,630
其他五张卡在谁手里
five cards.

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,200
嘿  你从录像中看出什么了吗？
Hey. You got anything off the video?

36
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,000
这是在50码外用手机录的
It's a camera phone 50 feet away.

37
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,030
所以  画面比较粗糙
So, it's pretty grainy.

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,000
还在打印
Still printing.

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,430
你坐过那种船吗
You ever been on one of those?

40
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,360
是的
Yeah.

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,430
那个时候我还是个酒鬼
I was still drinking at the time,

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,830
所以  我没什么太多的印象
so I don't remember much.

43
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,000
嗯
Um,

44
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,000
他们说我那时总出丑
told I was a lot of fun.

45
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,030
你呢
You?

46
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,930
不
No.

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,130
我以前住的地方没有多少船
Not a lot of yachts where I'm from.

48
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,960
我一直都向往住在那种船上
I always kind of wanted to live on one.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,800
我一直以为面朝大海是件不错的事
I thought it'd be nice to have the ocean as my front yard.

50
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,460
现在大海就近在你眼前
The ocean is your front yard.

51
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
你觉得我以前做的纸鸭子怎么样
What's wrong with the SS Minnow back there?

52
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,830
挺好的
Nothing.

53
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,760
你难道真想把那个放到水上
You really want to drop that thing in the water someday

54
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,860
让它带着你去神秘的地方
and sail off to parts unknown?

55
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
为什么不呢
Yeah, why not?

56
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,930
只要你和我在一起
As long as it's you and me.

57
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,530
你嘴真甜
I like the sound of that.

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,230
嘿 伙计
Yo, papi.

59
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,300
有发现了
We got something.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,060
总有那么一天的
One day.

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,130
发现了什么
What've we got?

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,930
我们发现了一张车牌
Uh, we got a, we got a license plate.

63
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,900
从手机录像里打印出来的
It's a printout from the camera phone.

64
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,160
数字很不清楚
The numbers are

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,230
所有的东西都不清楚
fuzzy, though. The whole damn thing's fuzzy.

66
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,160
不要管那车牌号了
Forget the numbers.

67
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
车牌旁边是什么
What's that next to the plate?

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,330
看起来是一张贴纸
Looks like a sticker.

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
-DMV?  -那是一面旗
-DMV? -That's a flag.

70
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,200
是外交部的车牌
It's a diplomatic plate.

71
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,130
伙计们 六个P
The Six Ps, guys.

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,360
以前我在福克斯河管理32个
When I supervised 32 COs

73
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
小组的时候  就是全靠这六个p来实现的
back at Fox River-- it was the Six Ps made it happen.

74
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,600
你能放大吗
Can you blow it up?

75
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,030
我得仔细看看
I need to see more detail.

76
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,160
我正在做了
I'm already on it.

77
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,830
准备  计划  预防
Prior, Planning, Prevents,

78
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,330
无视  贬低  表现
-Piss-Poor, Performance. -How about you

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
别抱怨了  说说你的想法
quit shaking your ass and say what's on your mind?

80
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,030
那个第二步
The second step.

81
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,130
破解内容
Deciphering the cards.

82
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,830
入侵行动  我们需要计划一下
The break-in. We need to plan.

83
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,160
赛尔夫探员会给我们那些资料
Agent Self will provide that information.

84
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,060
你和惠斯勒在一起呆过
You worked with Whistler.

85
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,600
他有没有提过一个地点
Didn't he say anything about a location?

86
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,660
会不会是在那本关于鸟的书上
Wasn't that in his bird book?

87
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,030
但是在帝博格手里
Which T-Bag has.

88
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,430
如果他活着逃出了索纳监狱
If he made it out of Sona alive.

89
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,730
找到突破口根本没有意义
Finding where the break-in is doesn't mean anything

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,100
因为我们没有那些卡
if we don't have the cards.

91
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,630
这就是那面旗
Here's your flag.

92
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,430
阿尔及利亚?  土耳其
Algeria? Turkey.

93
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,000
找到土耳其领事馆在哪里
Find out where the Turkish Consul is in town.

94
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,430
听着  到你出场了
You know what? Get with the program.

95
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,430
你去找
You're up.

96
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,360
他的名字是埃罗・特巴克
Uh, his name's Erol Tabak.

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
-领事馆在市中心 -但是
-Consulate is downtown. -Yeah, but

98
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,400
我们进不去领事馆
we can't get into the consulate.

99
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,830
我们可以从那里开始跟踪他
We can follow him from there.

100
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,660
迈克
Michael.

101
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,900
我想留下来研究一下录像
I'm gonna stay back and work on the video.

102
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,630
好的
Okay.

103
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,000
-会有那么一天的  -一定会
-One day. -one day.

104
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,400
科尔・普发
Cole Pfeiffer.

105
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,730

普发

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,330
P-f-e-i-f-e
P-f-e-i-f-e...

109
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
科尔・普发
Damn it!

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,730
科尔・普发
Cole Pfeiffer.

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,730

不对
No.

114
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,330
叫我科尔吧
Call me Cole, please.

115
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,530
P-f-e-i-f... e...
P-f-e-i-f... e...

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,100
操
Damn!

117
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,030


118
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,460
这就是我们要做到的
That's what we're doing here.

119
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,600
这就是我们伽特公司要做到的
That's what we're doing here at GATE.

120
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,500
我会鼓励你们所有人
And I would encourage all of you to...

121
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,200
嗯
Huh.

122
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,960
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
...f-e-r.
...f-e-r.

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,300
P-f-e-i-f...
P-f-e-i-f...

125
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,430
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,530
外交官平时都干什么
What do diplomats usually do?

127
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,660
也没什么事  就是能随意停车
Not a whole lot, but they park anywhere they want.

128
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,900
把这个放在车前面
Put this on the dash.

129
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,700
我们还能再靠近点吗
Can we get any closer?

130
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,230
就是他
That's our guy.

131
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,100
是吗
Yeah?

132
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,500
正在拷贝
We're copying.

133
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,800
卡在他身上
He's got the card on him.

134
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,060
太好了
Hell yes.

135
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,200
他老婆吗
That's his wife?

136
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,560
算我一个
Sign me up.

137
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,930
没信号了
You lost it.

138
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,100
怎么可能
How?

139
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,160
我也不知道
Dude, I don't know

140
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,460
我只能告诉你没有信号了
what to tell you other than you lost it.

141
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,230
什么都没有
It's gone, man.

142
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,130
没信号了
We lost it.

143
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,200
什么
What!

144
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,200
怎么可能收不到
How did we lose him?

145
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,260
我们就在他旁边
We're right next to him.

146
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,760
卡不在他那儿
He's not the cardholder.

147
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,060
在他老婆那儿
She is.

148
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,260
我们最好在被发现之前赶快离开
We gotta get out here now before we get made.

149
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,400
快点  走  走
Come on, go! Go!

150
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,320
我们有些共同点  你知道吧
You know what we've got in common, right?

151
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,380
什么
What?

152
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,950
我们都活在一个
We both live in the real world

153
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,680
没人理解现实世界里
as opposed to these other knuckleheads.

154
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,180
你刚才说到
So that whole prior planning

155
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,480
事前准备的事
thing you were talking about,

156
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
如果你有什么计划
if you got something on your mind

157
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,480
别人不关心  但你可以告诉我  好吗
and no one else is interested, you just run it by me, okay?

158
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,580
我们先这么说好
And we'll just leave it at that.

159
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,450
怎么样
All right.

160
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,380
喂
Hello?

161
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
莎拉

那个地方的价值现在是1亿

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,320
是的
Yes.

178
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,450
但我
But I...

179
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,820
该露面的时候 还是要露面的
It's important to keep up appearances.

180
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,320
这样就不会有人怀疑
Not arouse suspicion.

181
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,520

Fine.

182
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,380
我对你的领导能力很有信心 丽莎

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,620
我对你也很有信心
Nor do I.

185
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,180
所以 我现在就走了
So I won't keep you any longer.

186
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,980
请
Please...

187
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,180
注意安全

188
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,220
她出来了
There she is.

189
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,120
好吧  做你该做的
All right, do what you gotta do.

190
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,480
跟着她两分钟  这样才能拷贝卡
Be next to her for two minutes so the device can copy the card.

191
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,580
我能搞定

192
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,220
坐下 坐下
Take a seat. Take a seat.

看见那三个穿西装的了吗
See the three suits?

194
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,980
像三角一样在她周围
Forming a triangle around her?

195
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,320
那些是私人保镖
Those are private contractors.

196
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,480
"公司"只会在保护
The Company would only do that

197
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,720
重要人物的时候才这么做
for the inner circle.

198
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,320
我们不可能接近她
We're not getting anywhere near that lady.

199
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,720
-今天不行   -真倒霉
-Not today. -Great.

200
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,580
怎么了
What's wrong?

201

遇到老熟人了
Well, if it ain't the Brothers Grim.

203
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,380
冷静点  林肯  记着 我们需要他
Easy, Linc. Remember, we need him.

204
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,350
你来洛杉矶干什么
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

205
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,550
我想当一个摄影师
I was thinking about maybe getting me a career in pictures.

206
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,250
嘿  如果有人
Hey! If anyone's

207
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,980
有权生气  应该是我

208
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,520
你们把我留在巴拿马
You put me out to pasture back in Panama.

209
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,280
让我等死
Left me for dead.

210

这已经是第三次了

关于鸟的书
Bird book?

213
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,250
书在哪
Where's the book?!

214
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,150
帅哥  你看谁在看我们呢
Ooh, look who's looking, pretty.

215
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,250
看谁在看我们
Look who's looking.

216
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,550
我觉得
I don't think

217
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,720
你们俩更不应该在洛杉矶出现
the two of you are supposed to be carousing around the Angel City ...

218
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,720
你不知道你现在的处境有多复杂
You don't know what you've gotten yourself into,

219
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,180
帝博格  如果你不想知道
Teddy. But if you dot want to find out,

220
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,850
你就告诉我们书藏哪了
you're gonna tell us where that bird book is.

221
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,480
你们现在就让我走
You're gonna let me go right now

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,450
要不我们就都被抓
or all of us are going down together.

223
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,480
你选
Your choice.

224
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,580
林肯 走吧
Linc, come on.

225
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,850
走吧 林肯
Let's go, Linc!

226
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,820
唐克雷蒂. T-A-N...
Tancredi. T-A-N...

227
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,120
C-R-E-D-I.
C-R-E-D-I.

228
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,420
35英里以内
Make it a buckshot across the grid.

229
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,950
仔细盘查
35-mile radius.

230
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,720
如果她和其他名字出现了  告诉我
If she or any of those other names come up, call me.

231
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,180
明白
Confirmed.

232
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,950
你在哪
Where are you?

233
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,050
洛杉矶
Los Angeles.

234
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,150
在找莎拉・唐克雷蒂医生
Trailing Dr. Sara Tancredi.

235
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,850
我没让你找她
I ask for the knights, you're chasing a pawn.

236
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,620
她与这事无关
She's irrelevant.

237
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,020
和斯科菲尔德有关
Not to Scofield.

238
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,020
如果有人知道他在哪  肯定是她
If anyone knows what rock he's hiding under, it's her.

239
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,020
格雷琴怎么办
What about Gretchen?

240
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,580
我要让她说实话
I'm having her softened up,

241
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,420
但是我觉得她活着有什么意义
but I question the merit of keeping her alive.

242
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,920
我觉得你不应该让
I don't think you should allow...

243
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,550
她肯定知道一些事情
She must know something.

244
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,380
只要她招
She lives

245
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,180
她就没价值了
until she talks.

246
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,880
我需要你帮我做一些其他的事
Now, I have something else I need you to do for me.

247
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,480
好像有一个前任雇员
It seems a former employee

248
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,580
正在查找锡拉
is looking into Scylla.

249
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,450
帝博格也在这里吗
T-Bag's in town?

250
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,620
是的  但是我们跟丢了
Yeah, but we lost him.

251
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,980
他可能在任何地方
He could be anywhere by now.

252
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,080
他在哪不重要  重要的是他来这儿什么
It's not where he is. It's what he's doing.

253
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,150
他搞糟了我们的事情
He blew this whole thing for all of us.

254
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,420
-莎拉在哪  -船上
-Where's Sara? -The boat.

255
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,220
绝对的
Of course

256
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,450
他的死绝对是我的错
it's my fault that he's dead.

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,550
-不是的  -你我都清楚
-It's not true. -We both know it is.

258
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,750
我不应该给他打电话
I shouldn't have called him.

259
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,520
我知道的  我不应该找他
I knew that. I should never have reached out to him.

260
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,580
我不应该让他参与进来
I shouldn't have involved him in any...

261
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,020
班尼特是自愿帮你的
Bennett chose to help you.

262
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,180
是"公司"的人杀了他  不是你
The Company killed him, not you.

263
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,380
听我说  莎拉  这不是
Listen to me, Sara. This is...

264
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,120
这不是你的错
This is not your fault.

265
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,180
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,950

我是科尔・普发  真喜欢你的笑

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,950

271
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,020
叫我科尔就行了
Call me Cole.

272
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,120
怀特先生正在等你
Uh, Mr. White is looking forward to meeting with you,

273
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,620
科尔  不过他几分钟前

274
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,080

a few minutes late.

275
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,020
那么我们的谈话有多久
Precisely how few minutes are we talking about?

276
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,720
不会太久的
Oh, it shouldn't take long.

277
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,520
你可以在那边坐一会
You can have a seat right over there.

278
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,080
对了  我差点忘了
Oh. Oh, I almost forgot.

279
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,580
你有一条留言
You already have a message.

280
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,850

281

是的   星先生打过来的
Mm-hmm. Mr. Xing called.

282
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,680
打了两次
Twice.

283
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,750
我想你的人缘不错
I guess your reputation precedes you.

284
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,850
我也这么想
I guess so.

285
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,650
当・赛尔夫
Don Self.

286
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,550
他们什么时候发现那家伙的

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,750
今天早上
This morning.

288
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,280
他们说是自杀
They're saying it was a suicide,

289
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,780
但你和我最清楚
but you and I know better.

290
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,980
我想问你些很重要的事
So I need to ask you something very important, okay?

291
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,820
布鲁斯・班尼特知道你现在在哪吗
Did Bruce Bennet know where you are now?

292
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,980
我不知道
I don't know.

293
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,180
因为如果他知道的话
Because if he did,

294
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,520
公司现在就有好机会来行动
there's a damn good chance that the Company does now too.Okay?

295
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,150
所以你现在要加倍努力
So you need to work double time.

296
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,380
自己小心点  明白吗
Get some eyes in the back of your head, you understand?

我感谢你的鼓励
Look, I appreciate the motivational speech,

298
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,080
那你能告诉我
but how about you figure out

299
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,050
我们在哪才能找到那6张卡并且破译它吗
where we have to break in so we can decode those cards?

300
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,020
行了  我了解
I've, I've got

301
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,150
大家都在干活  对吧
some guys doing some digging, okay?

302
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,450
实际上  有两帮人给你干活
Actually, you might have two.

303
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,450
什么  你说什么呢
Well, what are you... what are you talking about?

他有一本曾经属于惠斯勒的书

308
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
马宏认为
to Whistler, and Mahone thinks...

309
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,220
那本书对我们有利
Mahone thinks this book has a plan for the break-in.

310
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,780
你开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

311
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,950

I wish I were.
