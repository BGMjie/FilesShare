1
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,220
I don't get it, Kenny.

2
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,220
Why do you buy razors and shaving cream.

3
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,220
[mumbles]

4
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,410
Shave your balls?

5
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,800
Why would you shave your balls?

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,800
[mumbles]

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,150
Girls like shaved balls?

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,060
[mumbles]

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,060
What girl is gonna see your balls?

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,160
[mumbles]

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,010
Oh, Jesus, there's another one.

12
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,690
Another panflute band.

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,430
Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,220
Yeah, I saw like three of those bands down at Denwer yesterday.

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,900
All their crappy music sounds the same.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go.

17
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,700
I think Kenny likes it.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,690
I gotta get home for dinner.

19
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,730
Yeah, me too.

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,770
God!

21
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,020
Shut up already.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,510
I'm outta here, see you guys.

23
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,530
Tonight. The travel channel takes you to London.

24
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,930
London has something for everyone.

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,590
Sights, cinema and wonderful street performers.

26
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,450
They're in London too?!

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,450
Time for dinner guys.

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,720
All right, kids, dig in.

29
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,910
Where's dad?

30
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,130
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in a bathtub.

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,910
- Why?
- Because ever since you father got that 

32
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,240
stupid videocamera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,710
All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner.

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,440
Randy, there's plenty of video of us eating dinner.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,960
There's Shelly! Excited about dinner, Shelly?

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,370
Cut it off, dad!

37
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,880
Oh, look, Stanley's eating a tater tot. Wave to the camera, Stan.

38
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,650
Oh, Jesus Christ!

39
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,940
Oh, Nido, it's one of those peruvian penflu bands.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,330
Stan, go out and stand with them so I could get a shot.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,050
I would play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces.

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,760
Screw you, Kyle.

43
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,760
Eh, all right, your turn, Kenny.

44
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,760
You guys, you guys, check this out.

45
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,510
I saw another peruvian flute band outside my house last night.

46
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,530
- So?
- So, so I've just set there and watched them for a while.

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,080
Guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,540
- How much?
- Over 200 bucks.

49
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,130
- Two hundred dollars?
- Really? You sure?

50
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,190
Yeah, dude. I'm certain to realize it's like easiest

51
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,470
job in the world, you know. I mean we could do that.

52
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,950
- Become a peruvian flute band?
- Yeah, why not?  

53
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,700
We get some instruments and some costumes and then

54
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,980
make some crappy panflute music CDs on my computer.

55
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,060
Oh my god! We are gonna make so much fucking money you guys.

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,480
- Yeah! Woo-hoo!

57
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,790
But where we gonna get the money to buy costumes and the instruments?

58
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,100
Craig, dude, how you're doing, bro?

59
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,870
- Fine.
- Cool, awesome.

60
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,250
Am, Craig, remember you were telling us how your grandma gave you a 100 bucks for your birthday?

61
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,860
Yeah.

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,470
Craig, how would you like to turn that $100 into a $1000?

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,670
Come on in, Craig, have a seat. Welcome.

64
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,020
What do you guys want?

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,460
Craig, we've chosen you to join our peruvian flute band.

66
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,810
All right, Craig!

67
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,090
You mean like those guys you see at all tourist spots?

68
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,980
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig, because they make bank!

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,330
We just need your money to buy some instruments and make some CDs.

70
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,560
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.

71
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,500
You guys never hang out with me, you never invite me to do stuff

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,760
but now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me $100.

73
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,920
Craig, don't be an asshole.

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,480
I'll go get the money.

75
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,770
All right, guys, just like we rehearsed. You ready, Craig?

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,780
All right, let's jam. And the one, and the two, and the--

77
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,230
Wow, that's such cultural music.

78
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,390
Very cultural, yes.

79
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,370
Por favor, buy our CDs da musica.

80
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,220
Gracias.

81
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,070
How cultural.

82
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,710
This is awesome.

83
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,200
You see, Craig?

84
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,750
Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey.

85
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,020
Hey you guys cannot play here. We were here first.

86
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,190
[speaks spanish]

87
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,420
Not play-a la musica in la promenade. No es bueno!

88
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,650
This is our peruvian flute band turf. You got that?

89
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,480
God damn it.

90
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,480
No! No es bueno!

91
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,460
C'mon guys.

92
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,470
Jesus Christ!

93
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,780
[speaks spanish]

94
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,610
Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing and economic

95
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,070
and ecological crysis of disasterous proportions.

96
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,540
I'm talking of course about peruvian flute bands.

97
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,530
The red dots indicate where's the highest concentrations of peruvian bands are.

98
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,620
All over the world wherever there are tourists or shoppers there are now on average

99
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,060
65 peruvian flute bands per sq. kilometer.

100
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,550
- General?
- France, Japan and the north-eastern US are currently the hardest hit.

101
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,550
Make no mistake.

102
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,920
This is the pan flute epidemic.

103
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,920
A pandemic?

104
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,840
Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,980
have already asked for our help in getting rid of their peruvian flute bands.

106
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,700
We will need every resource available to see this through.

107
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,230
Excuse me, but-- Aid other countries?

108
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,690
- Senator?
- With all due respect, we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands.

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Let other countries fend for themself.

110
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,960
You heartless bastard!

111
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,750
This country was founded in beliefs of freedom and integrity

112
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,930
and we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged

113
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,930
by peruvian flute bands. Is that clear?

114
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,710
As director of homeland security I'm taking control of the military

115
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,560
until the crysis is contained.

116
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,720
Go! Go!

117
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,110
Huh! Sort you right assholes.

118
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,760
One more over here. Let's go, get them out.

119
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,730
Clear up, move, this is homeland security operation, people. Let's go!

120
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,010
Hey! Back off!

121
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,250
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained.

122
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,540
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television.

123
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,410
Wave to the camera, Shelly.

124
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,190
What are you watching guys?

125
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,190
- The news.
- Huh?

126
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,200
We're watching the news.

127
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,190
Tht's the TV in our living room still showing commercials right now.

128
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,190
What do you thing about the television, Shelly?

129
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,760
Ah, the news is starting.

130
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,980
The government efforts to stop the peruvian flute band crysis are now on their third day.

131
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,340
In cities all over the world flute bands are being removed and quarantined.

132
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,340
But more may still be out there.

133
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,710
Homeland security's requesting that if you see a peruvian flute band, do not approach it

134
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,610
mark down the flute band's location and do not under any circumstations

135
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,910
buy their CDs.

136
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,850
The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to the quarantine area in Miami.

137
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,530
Excuse us, hello?

138
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,820
Excuse me, sir?

139
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,270
Sir? There's been a misunderstanding. Can-- Can I talk to you for a minute?

140
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:33,740
Sir?

141
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,940
Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?

142
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,320
Get back, I'm not buying any of your damned CDs.

143
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,730
No, sir, there's been a big misunderstanding, we actually aren't a peruvian

144
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,920
I've said I'm not buying any goddamned CDs today, you got that? I'm sick of it.

145
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,060
[speaking spanish]

146
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,300
[mumbles]

147
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,510
Hey, Craig, you know that money you grandma gave you for your bithday?

148
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,540
How would you like to invest in a peruvian flute band?

149
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,310
You can double your money in one afternoon, c'mon Craig, don't be an asshole.

150
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,270
Attention peruvian flute bands!

151
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,310
[translates into spanish]

152
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,880
We appreciate your cooperation and patience.

153
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,680
[translates into spanish]

154
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,270
Tomorrow you will be boarding ships.

155
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,450
[translates into spanish]

156
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,210
Which will take you to Guantanamo bay.

157
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,240
[translates into spanish]

158
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,190
Where you will spend the rest of your lives.

159
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,000
[translates into spanish]

160
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,080
Guantanamo bay? We can't go to the Guantanamo bay!

161
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,480
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.

162
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,330
Please, mr. and mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig.

163
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,330
Do you have any idea where they could have gone?

164
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,500
No! I'm telling you, this isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.

165
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
You've checked with the police?

166
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,670
Nobody knows anything, it's like the boys just wanished.

167
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,320
None of the other kids have seen them since-- Randy, would you put that thing down?!

168
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,830
What is wrong with you? Our son is missing!

169
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,930
Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.

170
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,930
Well then stop being an idiot and help!

171
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,100
Maybe the boys aren't ran away.

172
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,290
When have your boys upset about anything?

173
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,190
All we know was they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.

174
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,000
This exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,349
What is that supposed to mean?

176
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:50,080
To be honest, mrs. Tucker, we think Craig has a bad influence on our boys.

177
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,310
Now wait just a minute!

178
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,659
I'm just saying that your son has some problems.

179
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:56,309
Like every kid doesn't have some problems.

180
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:58,750
Obviously, Craig has gotten them into some kind of problems.

181
00:11:58,487 --> 00:11:59,541
Oh my god!

182
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,401
Oh, this is good.

183
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,660
Sir, good news! Looks like we did it.

184
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,660
Every major city is reporting zero peruvian flute bands. We've got them all.

185
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,390
Calm down people, we still have work to do.

186
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,570
We have to take out the place this flute bands came from so they never come again.

187
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,750
We don't know where they came from, sir. We've been researching but we can't figure it out.

188
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,660
Well, think about it idiot. Where else would peruvian flute bands come from?

189
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,220
- Hmmm--
- The country is in the name!

190
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,350
No, sir. We checked the entire map, there isn't a coutry named Peruvian anywhere.

191
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,670
Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here.

192
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,670
PE-RU

193
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,560
Now I want a plan and place to take out Peru once and for all.

194
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,090
- Is that really necessary, sir? Seems a little extreme.
- Yeah.

195
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,410
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us unless they are stopped at the source.

196
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,850
Sir, you better come quick. One of the panflute bands was trying to escape.

197
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,170
See? God damn it!

198
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,920
The llama brothers, tapas and moodscapes.

199
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,070
This is a mistake, sir. We aren't really a peruvian flute band.

200
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:22,120
Right. You just play panflute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a lama, but you are not a peruvian flute band.

201
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,320
We-- We just kids, you know. We just trying to get some money.

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,540
We just wanna go home.

203
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,820
[mumbles]

204
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,010
Which tourist location were they playing at?

205
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,270
In outdoor mall in Colorado.

206
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,097
Look, we're from Colorado. We-- We grew up in the US.

207
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,759
- We speak english.
- And we're white.

208
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,070
Let me talk to you guys out here.

209
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,800
- Well, what do you think?
- I don't know what to make of it, sir.

210
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,680
It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a peruvian flute band and yet they aren't.

211
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,230
They play panflute music like the others but they talk and act like one of us.

212
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,600
I agree. They obviously some kind of-- hybrid.

213
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,080
A hybrid? How was that possible?

214
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,590
Perhaps a peruvian flute band made it with one of our females, who knows.

215
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,420
Sir, if they are the hybrid we're talking about, then they could be our way of taking out Peru, once and for all.

216
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,370
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?

217
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,670
Because you always do stuff like this.

218
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,250
You always coming up with some stupid idea to do something and then it backfires

219
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,270
and then you end up in some foreign country or outer space or something.

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
That's why noone likes hanging out with you guys.

221
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,580
You're being extremely negative, Craig.

222
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:50,980
All right, here's the deal. Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us, we'll get you home.

223
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,910
Help you how?

224
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,350
You're able to walk amongst the peruvian flute bands, they see you as one of them.

225
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,710
We're going to send you to their capital.

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,180
Can we please just go home, sir?

227
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,800
We still don't know whose side you're on. You do this and we'll know. You leave for Peru in the morning.

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,890
No, no, I'm not going to Peru, not Peru!

229
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,190
- Kyle, calm down.
- You know, I can't go there, Stan!

230
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,080
One of our friends was raped in Peru, it was very dramatic.

231
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:22,370
You don't have a choice. Either you go to Peru or you get up locked forever with the other flute bands.

232
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,970
Thompson, can you get over there?

233
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,460
The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.

234
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:39,090
[speaks spanish]

235
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,680
They're saying something "You can't send us away, we're the protectors"

236
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,130
Protectors from what?

237
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,170
[speaks spanish]

238
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,320
- What's that mean?
- I think he's said "The Furry Death"

239
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,780
[speaks spanish]

240
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,130
This is CNN

241
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,160
Last of peruvian flute band have successfuly been eradicated from every part of the world.

242
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,880
Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and-- Paul?

243
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,630
Pretty nice not have any peruvian music I suspect?

244
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,920
Really welcome silence, Tom.

245
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,310
There hasn't been a peruvian panflute band in sight for days now and everyone's enjoying the peace.

246
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,940
The world breathe a collective relief now as we thank--

247
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,100
What the--

248
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:42,340
Oh my god-- Jesus-- AAAARGH

249
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,610
There's-- There's something else here, it's-- it's not a peruvian flute band, it's like--

250
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,690
Oh my god, what is that thing?

251
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,230
- Paul, what do you see?
- It's furry, it's really furry!

252
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,160
Okay, obviously something different has shown up--

253
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Did he said furry?

254
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,530
Okay. We're-- We're experiencing some--

255
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,410
Oh my god, what is that thing?

256
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:32,730
All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border while you'll be briefed on mission specifics.

257
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:43,910
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a peruvian flute band

258
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,540
that any of you said "Hey, you know, this plan may backfire"

259
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,370
No, that never accused to you, because you guys are jerks and you never learn from your mistakes.

260
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,690
And that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.

261
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,960
That's not true, kids at school like us, don't they?

262
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,860
Yeah, dude. Kids at school totally like us, Craig just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.

263
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,220
- I'm being a dick?
- Yes!

264
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:19,230
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru. And I'm being a dick?

265
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,100
Let's no talking to this guy.

266
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,590
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home, we'll get you your money back and will never talk to you again. How's that?

267
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,450
That would be great. Thank you.

268
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,050
This is wrong. This just doesn't make any sense. Why would homeland security send us into Peru?

269
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,050
[mumbles]

270
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,350
I don't know, it just feels like-- there's got to be something else going on here.

271
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,490
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help. I think our boys might really be in trouble this time.

272
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,880
Yes. Yes, please, check and call me right back. Thank you.

273
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,860
Randy, I swear to god, if you don't put that thing away--

274
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,940
Sharon, you goona be really glad I have all this footage of the family some day.

275
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,060
I mean it, Randy. That's enough. You don't have to videotape every single--

276
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,790
What the hell was that?

277
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,820
- Oh my god.
- Something's going on outside. Stay here.

278
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,320
- What's going on, dad?
- Get back to your room, Shelly.

279
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,520
- What's going on?
- They are all over the place.

280
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,780
- What are?
- The really furry.

281
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,530
What did that?

282
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,730
What is that thing?

283
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,800
Mr. Marsh you have to move, it isn't safe to be--

284
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,210
Oh my god!

285
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,350
Go-go-go, go back the other way!

286
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,690
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!

287
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,530
I'm so-- startled.

288
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,690
Sir, we've got a bigger problem.

289
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,720
Oh? And what might that be?

290
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,640
New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction of what appear to be--

291
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,620
Guinea pigs?

292
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,040
Yes sir! How did you know?

293
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,570
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davies. Did you know that?

294
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,620
- Sir?
- I've really thought you got me in Miami.

295
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,370
But you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.

296
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,660
You-- You knew this was going to happen.

297
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,820
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davies. And I can't let you interfere.

298
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,030
Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen.

299
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,510
The panflute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs arising

300
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:36,780
and the only person who could have stop all this is on his way to the middle of nowhere.
