17
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:39,256
Dude, these little remote-controlled
cars are kick ass.

18
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,534
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump.

19
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:43,867
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one.

00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:27,823

...What the hell just happened?

37
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,396
Oh. Hello there, children!

38
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,751
Chef, we just got served.

39
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,310
Oh boy... Well come on inside, children.
I'll make you some cocoa.

40
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,869
Have a seat, children.
Just try to relax and breathe.

41
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:58,033
- Are you all okay?
- Yeah.

42
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:01,603
All right. Now, where did you get served?

43
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:02,998
Over at the True Value parking lot.

44
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,661
There were just these kids we never saw before
showed up and they were like,

45
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,338
really good dancers and, we don't really
understand what it means, but I guess...

46
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,046
Okay okay, relax children.

47
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,460
Relax. It's all over now.

48
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,470
Just try to calm down and sit tight.

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,194
I'm gonna call your parents and 
let them know you're okay.

50
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,227
Mrs. Marsh?

51
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,549
Hi, it's Chef.

52
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,835
Yeah, I'm good. Listen :

53
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:26,509
Stan and his friends just got served.

54
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,745
Yeah.

55
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,220
Yeah, over at the True Value.

56
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,175
No no, he's fine.
They're all fine.

57
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,015
Yeah, it was some kids from out of town.

58
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,831
Apparently they were pretty good dancers.

59
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,349
They really let 'em have it.

60
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:44,365
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish.
I want you to feel better, okay.

61
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,591
What's the matter with him?

62
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,608
Oh. Stan got served at school today.

63
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,798
You got served? By who?

64
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:53,568
Some, kids from Orange County.

65
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,241
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

66
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,239
So wha- so what'd you do?
D'you dance back?

67
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,315
No.

68
00:02:58,315 --> 00:03:00,520
What? Yo-you got served and just
stood there and took it??

69
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,933
That was the right thing to do.

70
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,217
Naw, that's crap, Sharon!

71
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,063
Stanley, when somebody challenges
 you to dance,

72
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,692
you have to dance back at them,
or else they'll think you're weak.

73
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:09,229
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.

74
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,870
Well then, it's about time you learned!

75
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,223
Put on some loose-fitting clothes
and meet me in the garage!

76
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,711
- But Dad...
- Now !

77
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:19,039
All right son, dancing is all 
about a frame of mind.

78
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,035
Now, I'm not telling you to go around
challenging other kids to dance,

79
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,537
but when they challenge you,

80
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,292
you just look 'em straight in the eye,

81
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:26,940
and give 'em this.

82
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,894
Come on, Stan.

83
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:43,099
...six, seven, eight.

84
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,472
Dude, that is a sweet RC car.

85
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:51,899
Yeah, let's go race it right now.

86
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:54,075
Well, what we got here?

87
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,248
It's the white boys that were served yesterday.

88
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,840
You want a little more, homeboys?

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,479
We're not interested, thanks.

90
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,581
You're not interesetd?

91
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:03,878
Not interested in this??

92
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,710
Oh Lord, look at those moves.

93
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,799
Oooo, they are takin' it out!

94
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:18,466
Oh man, they are getting served!

95
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,396
Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!

96
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:22,715
Have mercih!

97
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:25,687
- Oooooo, look at that!
- Lord!

98
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:27,219
Gettin' served!

99
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:51,042
Yeah! Go Stan!

100
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,238
Oh no!

101
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:53,375
No, stop Stan!

102
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,791
You don't know what you're doin'!

103
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,485
All right Stan!

104
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,478
HA! You just got f'd in the a!

105
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:08,286
- Wha?
- Yeah! YOU got served!

106
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,248
- Yeah!
- That's right!

107
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,947
- All right!
- No no no!

108
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:12,383
Okay.

109
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:14,537
All right. We got served.

110
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,241
So now, I guess...

111
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,465
It's on.

112
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:20,957
What?

113
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:21,922
This Saturday!

114
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,181
Our top five dancers against 
your top five dancers!

115
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,015
OC Convention Center. It's on!

116
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:27,706
It's on! It's on!

117
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:29,081
Oh Lord it's on!

118
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,136
Oh damnit! 

119
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:31,486
I knew that  was gonna happen.

120
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:33,194
We'll see you Saturday, fools!

121
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:36,025
Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better 
dancers with you than those loozas!

122
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:36,934
'Cause it's on!

123
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,755
It's on! It's on!

124
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:44,093
Stan, what the hell did 
you dance back for??

125
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,680
I thought I was supposed to!

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,998
Now you've gotta compete against them
in the dance competition on Saturday!

127
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,298
But why??

128
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:53,584
Because if you get served and
served them back, then it's on!

129
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,209
Don't you know anything??

130
00:05:58,428 --> 00:05:59,727
Well, nice going, Randy!

131
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,756
Really great advice you gave our son here!

132
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:02,940
What?

133
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,658
Those kids showed up to serve
Stan again and he danced back!

134
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,236
So what happened?

135
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:08,359
It's on!

136
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:27,804
Come on now, keep it tight!

137
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,761
Good. Now watch that
timing, drill team!

138
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:39,435
- All right!
- All right!

139
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:40,848
- Yeah, bad ass!
- Yeah, that was tight!

140
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:42,480
Not bad, kids.
Not bad.

141
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,619
Not bad? South Park doesn't
stand a chance!

142
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,105
- I heard that!
- All right, it was good.

143
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,839
But we don't want "good,"
we want pain!

144
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,154
Uh ex, excuse me.

145
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:51,966
Yeah?

146
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:55,987
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh.
I'm I'm Stan Marsh's father.

147
00:06:55,987 --> 00:07:00,106
Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna
get f'd in the a on Saturday?

148
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:03,814
Uh, listen.

149
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:06,897
Ih, it was my fault that Stanley
served your boys the other day.

150
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:09,253
Uh, I told him to do it and I...

151
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:12,159
Weh well look I, I just came
 down here to tell you...

152
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,768
Ih it's not on.

153
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:15,588
Oh, it's on!

154
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:17,327
Nonono, it's not on.

155
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,022
Whoo, it's on all right!

156
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,031
It isn't on.
Nothing's on.

157
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:21,910
It's off.

158
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,239
It's on!

159
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,976
I'm keeping my son home on Saturday.

160
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,884
I just came by to let you know so you can...

161
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:29,373
put a stup to all this. Good bye.

162
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,039
Hold on a second, clamhead!

163
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,775
You think you can just roll in here and tell
us it's not on when it very clearly is on?!

164
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,205
You're just trying to make us 
not practice, aren't you?!

165
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:41,949
Because you KNOW that your kids are goin'
down when my kids give them this!

166
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:43,604
Give me some moves out, Girl T!

167
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,162
Check this out!

168
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,477
- Yeah! You like that?!
- Oooo man!

169
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,439
Ohhh Lord!

170
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,477
Oooo, he is gettin' served!

171
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:07,171
Randy? Randy, oh my God!

172
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,961
What happened to him, Doctor?

173
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,901
He got served. Worst I've ever seen.

174
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:15,407
Old fool went down to the OC
to try to reason with the other team,

175
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,727
and he got served up somethin' fierce.

176
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:19,053
Oh Lord...

177
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:22,344
His dancing was so fast I...
couldn't do anything.

178
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:25,352
His moves were...so original,
so inventive.

179
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,555
Shh relax, Mr. Marsh.

180
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,896
We just got the X-rays back.

181
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,253
He mostly got served here,and here

182
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,863
But the worst serving was 
here in the pelvic region.

183
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,093
The road to recovery will be a long one.

184
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:39,929
Boy.

185
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,388
You must really wanna take to those 
Orange County kids now, huh Stan?

186
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,378
Are you kiddin'?

187
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:47,696
Stan is probably ready to pounce on them
after what they did to his father!

188
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,801
I, I don't know. He seems all right.

189
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,896
I could only imagine the rage
building inside you, Stan.

190
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:57,391
I bet you can't wait to outdance
those OC bastards!

191
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:58,940
Stan, Stan!

192
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,521
Yeahh I'm I'm right here, Dad.

193
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,908
Stan, listen to me.

194
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:06,299
I don't want you feeling like you have to 
do that competition now to avenge me.

195
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:06,791
Okay, good.

196
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,306
But I know I can't stop you from doing it.

197
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,054
So all I can say is...

198
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:12,695
give 'em hell, son.

199
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:14,324
Give 'em hell.

200
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:20,343
God damnit!

201
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,047
Hey guys. 

202
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,217
Uh. You guys know how to dance, right?

203
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,914
Of course we know how to dance.

204
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:34,093
Cool, because, there's this 
competition on Saturday,

205
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,236
and I have to find the very best dancers
in South Park to be on my crew.

206
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:39,014
My friends can't do it because they suck ass,

207
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,592
so, will you be in my dance troupe?

208
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,078
Dance troupe? Please.

209
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,881
We don't dance like those Britney
and Justin wannabes at school.

210
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,445
Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.

211
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:50,016
Yeah. The only cool way to dance
is to keep your hands at your sides

212
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:51,273
and your eyes looking at the ground.

213
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,463
Then every three seconds you take
a drag from your cigarette.

214
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,075
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen...

215
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,551
there's a dance competition this Saturday

216
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:11,582
and I need good dancers 
so I don't get served.

217
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:12,871
No way.

218
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:15,943
Dancing is something you do alone
in your room at three in the morning.

219
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:18,001
Please, you guys, our whole town's
reputation is at stake!

220
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,892
- Will any of you do it?
- I'm not doin' it.

221
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,881
Being in a dance group 
is totally conformist.

222
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:25,258
Yeah. I'm not conforming to
some dance-off regulations.

223
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,339
I'm not doin' it either.
I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.

224
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:34,452
I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not
 going to conform with the rest of you.

225
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:35,500
Okay, I'll do it.

226
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,440
Great!

227
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:38,647
Whoa. 

228
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,414
I think we just got put in our place.

229
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,256
Yeah. We just got Goth-served.

230
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,197
All right, we gotta find three
other kids that can dance.

231
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:46,607
We should go to the arcade.

232
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:47,616
The arcade?

233
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:49,415
Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao.

234
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,575
He's an expert at that
Dance Dance Revolution game.

235
00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,177
Dude, he's incredible.

236
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,954
He should be. He's here playing that
game every single day after school.

237
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,276
I think he's spent about six 
thousand dollars on it so far.

238
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:22,575
Hey kid, you're pretty good.

239
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:23,895
How would you like to join our dance troupe?

240
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:27,037
You mean, dancing without a 
machine telling you what to do?

241
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:27,827
Yeah.

242
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:28,920
That's stupid.

243
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,126
Dude, we need you.

244
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:32,718
I can't dance without the machine.

245
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:34,645
It's all right. My friend Chef 
is gonna coach us.

246
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,298
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

247
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:37,728
All right, that's three!

248
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,381
- Dude, we need a girl.
- Huh?

249
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:41,137
We can't be a dance troupe with just guys.

250
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,561
People will think we're fags.

251
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:43,392
Oh yeah. 

252
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,364
Wait a minute. I know just where to go!

253
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,255
Hi guys, welcome to Raisins.
Three of you?

254
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,559
Ah actually we were just hoping
we could talk to you guys real quick.

255
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,391
You have to buy wings
if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls.

256
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,964
And so we're putting all the best dancers
in South Park together to beat Orange County.

257
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,175
Wow, that sounds great.

258
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,990
I always wanted to try my
dancing somewhere else.

259
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:09,123
So you'll do it?

260
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:10,119
Why not?

261
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,541
All right, we just need one more person!

262
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,242
Hey, we should get that kid that 
was state champion in tap dancing.

263
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:16,597
What? The state tap champion
is from here? Who?

264
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:20,063
I think his name was...
Leopold... Stotch or something?

265
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,394
Leopold Stotch...? 

266
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:23,178
Wait a minute. You mean...

267
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,195
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples.

268
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,827
Loo loo loo, you've got some too.

269
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:29,655
- Loo loo loo, I've...
- Butters, you have some visitors.

270
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,230
Oh well hi there everybody.

271
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,909
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition
this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.

272
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,659
Wow, neato, a competiton?

273
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,512
Why, I'd love to. What kind
of competition is it?

274
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:39,449
It's a dance-off.

275
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:41,876
We heard you were tap dancing
state champion two years ago.

276
00:12:44,503 --> 00:12:45,891
... No

277
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:47,803
But, you were, weren't you?

278
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,286
Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.

279
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:50,474
No. 

280
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,593
No no nono no no, no!

281
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,041
No no nono no no, no!

282
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:56,988
Butters ?

283
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:57,826
Butters ??

284
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:01,166
We just asked him to join our dance troupe.
We heard he was state tap champion.

285
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:04,222
Oh dear.

286
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:06,429
I'm sorry kids, it's just that...

287
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,698
Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.

288
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:09,780
A tragedy?

289
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:13,569
I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.

290
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,003
Damnit, where are we gonna
get our fifth member?

291
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:19,453
Hey I heard about this guy in Cuomo
who has a duck that can dance.

292
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,578
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid!

293
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:23,412
Those OC kids are professional dancers!

294
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:25,996
Now come on, there's gotta be one 
other talneted person in South Park.

295
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,355
All right, so you're sure he can dance?

296
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:07,419
Oh yeah.

297
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,465
There he is. That's Jeffy.

298
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:14,641
That don't look like a dancing duck to me.

299
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:16,471
Well, that's 'cause it needs music.

300
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:17,671
Here y-here ya go, Jeffy.

301
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:22,783
" You'll do a line and I'll do a line,honeeey. "

302
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:25,957
" You'll do a line and I'll do a line,babe. "

303
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:29,034
You'll do a line and I'll do a line,
we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.

304
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,851
Honey, babe, be mine.

305
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,521
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey

306
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:36,702
Ih ih Is that the only song he'll dance to?

307
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,786
No no, he'll dance to anything. See?

308
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:42,423
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.

309
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,107
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.

310
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:48,176
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.

311
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,356
Butters? 

312
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:56,360
Butters? Come on, sweetie,
it's gonna be okay.

313
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,281
Come on, Butters.

314
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:00,460
You went through a lot of therapy for this.

315
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:02,762
That was almost two years ago, sweetie.

316
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,528
Two years ago.

317
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:06,909
Two years ago!

318
00:15:11,581 --> 00:15:15,007
That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis,
folks. Let her hear it!

319
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,647
All right, and now, dancing to the song

320
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:20,282
"I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You,"

321
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,301
here is Colorado state champion,

322
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,530
Leopold "Butters" Stotch!

323
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,705
I've got something in my front pocket for you

324
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,992
Why don't you reach down in my
pocket and see what it is

325
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,820
Then grab onto it, it's just for you

326
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,704
Give a little squeeze and say,
"How do you do?"

327
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:43,776
There's something in my front pocket,

328
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,415
There's something in my front pocket-

329
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,432
Paul. Paul!

330
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,212
No! Nooo!
Noooooooooooooooo!

331
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,521
All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'!

332
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,526
We don't have much time,

333
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:22,835
and you've got to become the 
dance group you can be.

334
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:24,022
I think we should...

335
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,661
Whoa.

336
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:31,247
This... is the dance troupe?

337
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:33,888
Yeah, dude, the best dancers 
South Park has to offer.

338
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:36,091
Oh boy.

339
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,550
All right, well, why don't you
show me what you got?

340
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,334
I wanna see what you kids can do!

341
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,345
Oh Lord have mercy.

342
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:00,724
Children, children!

343
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:02,369
No no, you've got it all wrong.

344
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:03,958
Don't you see, children?

345
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,061
You have the heart, but
you don't have the soul.

346
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:09,131
Nono, wait.

347
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:12,644
You have the soul, but
you don't have the heart.

348
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:14,110
Nono, scratch that.

349
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,678
You have the heart and the soul,

350
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:19,086
but you don't have the talent.

351
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,159
We're gonna get served
on Saturday, aren't we?

352
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:23,856
What? I don't wanna get served.

353
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:26,120
Yeah, you didn't tell us that
 we might get served.

354
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,373
Well that was the whole
point of the whole thing

355
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,622
the guys came back and they said we were
 gonna get served and we were like...

356
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,578
All right all right, quiet, children!

357
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:33,578
Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it.

358
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:35,873
We just gotta buckle down, dig deep,

359
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:38,512
and pray that maybe the other 
team comes down with cancer.

360
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:48,174
What do you want?

361
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,801
I came to ask you one more
time to join the crew.

362
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,678
Everyone is practicing really hard, but...

363
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,454
I don't think we have any 
kind of shot without you.

364
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:56,886
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore.

365
00:17:56,886 --> 00:17:57,993
I gave that up.

366
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,828
Your mom says you were one of 
the best dancers in the country.

367
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:03,301
Did she also tell you my dancing
got eight people killed?

368
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:06,091
Yeah. She said your shoe came off.
It wasn't your fault

369
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:08,742
Yeah well, you tell that to their families.

370
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:12,814
Look, Butters, accidents happen.
We all have to live with that.

371
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:15,246
I let those people down!
Don't you get it man?!

372
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,539
Eight people died!

373
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,614
Well, it was nine, actually.
One of the women was pregnant.

374
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:20,386
Oh what?

375
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,403
And eleven if you count the two family members
that killed themselves afterward.

376
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,423
But that isn't the point, Butters!

377
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:27,513
The point is that this is now!
It's on!

378
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:29,088
And there are people who
need you to step up!

379
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,623
Look, nobody likes having
to rise to a challenge.

380
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:35,442
But competing against other people and getting in their
faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life.

381
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:39,791
And if you can't face that, then you might as well
sit here and play Leggos until you're an old man.

382
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,034
Get out of my room, Stan!

383
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:44,237
Fine.

384
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,295
But someday you're gonna have to stop running from
what happened and start dealing with it.

385
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,000
Otherwise, you might as well move
to France with all the other pussies.

386
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:05,048
Yeah, make some noise!

387
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:09,549
Ladies and Gentlemen,

388
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,588
man, you are all in for a treat!

389
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:14,682
Whichever crew wins tonight,
you wanna remember their faces,

390
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:16,373
'cause the next time you see them...

391
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,637
will be in Lil Kim's next video!

392
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,167
Give it up for Lil Kim!

393
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,254
What's up, niggaz?!

394
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,967
This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all.

395
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,811
So let's give it up for the OC Crew!

396
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:36,688
And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!

397
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:41,199
Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.

398
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:42,581
Aww yeah.

399
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,132
Aight y'all. It's showtime!

400
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:46,876
Dancers to the floor!

401
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:50,401
Stan. Stan, we have a big problem.

402
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:50,878
What?

403
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:52,459
It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.

404
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:56,618
What happened??

405
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:59,048
He was practicing the say takedown
and slipped on the floor.

406
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:01,127
Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!

407
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:01,999
Can he move it?

408
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:04,622
Aw, what do we do, Chef??

409
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,580
Rules are you have to have five dancers.

410
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,174
We have no choice, children.
We have to forfeit.

411
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,290
Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.

412
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,376
They're too scared!
Looks like they already got served!

413
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:22,532
Hey!

414
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:24,329
Can I still dance with you guys?

415
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,266
- Butters!
- All right!

416
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,906
All right come on, let's do this!

417
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:33,027
DJ! Give us a hot track!

418
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:58,796
Waaah!

419
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,328
No! Jesus, not again!

420
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:07,453
Kill him!

421
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:19,461
Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead.

422
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,399
That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!

423
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:24,394
Yeah! All right!

424
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:26,210
All right! We did it!

425
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,046
- All right Butters!
- You dd it!

426
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:30,252
You did it, son! You did it!

427
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:31,788
All right, Butters!

428
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:37,252
Noho! Noho! Noooooo!

429
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:43,300
