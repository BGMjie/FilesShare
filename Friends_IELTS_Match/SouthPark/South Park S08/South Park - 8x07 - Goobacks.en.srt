3
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:10,082
I'm going down to South Park

4
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:11,795
gonna have myself a time

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,603
friendly faces everywhere

6
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,547
humble folks without temptation

7
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:16,698
going down to south park

8
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:18,511
gonna leave my woes behind

9
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:19,953
ample parking day or night

10
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,145
people spouting"howdy neighbor"

11
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:23,185
headin' on up to south park

12
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,984
gonna see if i can't unwind

13
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:28,194
(muffled mumble muffled mumble)

14
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,952
so come on down to south park

15
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,640
and meet some friends of mine

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,770

17
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:41,014
Yes?

18
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:43,209
Hel-lo ma'am.

19
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:46,317
We're going around town and
offering snow-shoveling service.

20
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,361
Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled

21
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,660
for eight thousand dollars?

22
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:52,794
Oh well, I certainly could use
some little snow-shovelers,

23
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:54,921
but eight thousand dollars
seems a little steep.

24
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:56,115
How about ten dollars?

25
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:59,518
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of
that tight grip you have on my balls!

26
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:01,418
Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!

27
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:02,879
How about fifteen dollars?

28
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,466
It's a deal! All right, guys,
let's get to work!

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,498
Yeah, it's so totally awesome.

30
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,461
Craig crapped his pants when he saw it.

31
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:15,600
Yeah, sweet.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,671
So what's goin' on over there?

33
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,146
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

34
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:21,121
No way!

35
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,641
He did not! Aw dude,
that is so weak.

36
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:25,735
What?

37
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,118
You've been on your fucking
phone since we started!

38
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:29,010
Dude, I'm takin' a break.

39
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:30,829
A break from what?! You
haven't done anything!

40
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,742
Kyle, how many times do we
have to go through this?

41
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,053
I'm the negotiator.

42
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,054
I negotiate our price with the customers.

43
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,518
All you ever do is talk about your balls!

44
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,723
It works, doesn't it?

45
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,341
Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?

46
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:43,472
If you want your share of the money, then you're
gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!

47
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:45,620
Hey! Don't boss me around,
you fuckin' Jew!

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,934
I will kick your ass!

49
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:53,788
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?

50
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:55,786
Oh goodness, what happened?

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,411
Shoveling accident.

52
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,235
Oooh no, come on inside.

53
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:02,904
Wait right here, I'll be right back.

54
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:06,773
You're so lucky I have
a... sore shoulder,Kyle,

55
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,079
or I'd totally let you have it.

56
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,256
Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.

57
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,506
This is breaking news.
Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown.

58
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:15,507
Incredible, absolutely amazing news today.

59
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:18,322
A man from the future
has come back in time

60
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:21,293
and is in a government hospital
after being hit by a car.

61
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:22,795
Whoa.

62
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:24,638
Christina Naylon has more.

63
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:26,540
The news is incredible, Aaron.

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,583
Experts and scientists have been with the man
from the future for several hours now,

65
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,846
and have been able to learn
that he is from the year 3045.

66
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:36,800
His condition is stable, and speculation
continues as to why he has come.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,832
Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer?

68
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:40,787
Or to fix something wrong with the past?

69
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,466
Have to interrupt you there, Christina.

70
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:45,606
Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside
the base with breaking news.Brad?

71
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:49,240
Aaron, the scientists have been able to
communicate further and have uncovered

72
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,319
that the man from one thousand years
in the future has come to our time...

73
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:53,893
looking for work.

74
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:57,878
Uh he has said that the future is
so overwhelmingly overpopulated

75
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:59,980
that there are simply no jobs in his time,

76
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,183
and so he built a time portal and has
come back to 21st century America,

77
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,422
uh to find a job here.

78
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:07,182
Heheh, it's absolutely astounding.
He came back here for work?

79
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,621
Huh... that's right, Aaron.
Hi-his plan is to get a job here, in our time,

80
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,332
so that he can put the money he
earns into a savings account,

81
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:18,833
uh, which will earn interest, and by the
year 3045 be worth billions of dollars,

82
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:22,192
uh which of course in the future will
be worth only hundres of dollars,

83
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,190
but uh enough, he says,
to feed his family.

84
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,207
And now I understand we're
going to Harrison Moore,

85
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:29,148
uh, for an explanation on how
the time portal works.Harrison?

86
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:34,409
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which
scientists say follow Terminator rules.

87
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:37,403
That is, it's one way only
and you can't go back.

88
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:40,314
This is in contrast, to say,
Back To The Future rules,

89
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,999
where back and forth is possible,

90
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:45,146
and of course, Timerider rules,
which are just plain silly.

91
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:48,378
Anyway, it appears that the man
from the future is here to stay.

92
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,409
Mom, Dad! Did you see?
They found a man from the future!

93
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,133
We know, Stanley. We've been watching.

94
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,789
If you're just joining us,
a man from over two thousand years into

95
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,703
the future has come through a one-way
time portal looking for work.

96
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:04,576
Uh, the President is expected to
give an announcement at any time.

97
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,779
Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron.

98
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,940
It appears that another person
from the future has just arrived!

99
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,971
It looks as if the job at Wendy's
did work for the original immigrant;

100
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,494
this second arrivee claims that
man's family is now much better off,

101
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,096
and wishes the same for his family.

102
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:24,402
There you go. All set, sweetie?

103
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:26,994
Mom, can we go try to see
the people from the future?

104
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,688
I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.

105
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:31,989
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon.
It's pretty exciting, isn't it?

106
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,354
Now, you just get some sleep.
You've had a busy day.

107
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:36,030
Goodnight, sweetie.

108
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:36,905
Night, Mom.

109
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:42,279
Wow, two people from the future.
How cool.

110
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:16,344
Yes?

111
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,342
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like
snow-shoveling service again today?

112
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:22,299
Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys,

113
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,257
but I've already hired someone else to do it.

114
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,338
What?? Who??

115
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:29,311
One of those immigrants from the future. He
said he would do it for twenty-five cents.

116
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,464
Twenty-five cents?
Well that's not even worth it.

117
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:33,860
All right guys, come on.
Let's go to the next house.

118
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:36,634
Dude.

119
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,335
Son of a bitch!

120
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,144
Still more immigrants from the future
arrived at the time border today,

121
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:49,602
some even bringing their entire families.

122
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:52,197
The purplish goo that they have
on their bodies when they arrive...

123
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:55,096
is an ectoplasmic side effect
of the time-travel process.

124
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:59,637
This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to
learn even more about American life in the future.

125
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,375
Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?

126
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,936
Yes, there are incredible things we're learning
about Americans in the future,

127
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:06,714
Aaron. Eh it appears that in the future,

128
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:11,151
Americans have evolved into
a hairless uniform mix of all races.

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,482
They are all one color, which is a yellowy
light-brownish whitish color.

130
00:07:16,026 --> 00:07:18,776
Uh it seems race is no longer
an issue in the future,

131
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:21,005
because all ethnicities have mixed into one.

132
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,296
Perhaps most interesting is how
this has affected their language.

133
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:27,707
The people in the future speak
a complete mix of English,

134
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:30,458
Chinese, Turkish and, indeed,
all world languages,

135
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,963
which sounds something like this:

136
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,126
Back to you, Aaron.

137
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,778
Apparently the people from the future are
having a pretty easy time finding work.

138
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:40,798
Since they offer to work for such low wages,

139
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,863
they're being hired all over America.

140
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,040
This is bullcrap!
I ain't standin' for this!

141
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:52,072
All right, folks, my name is Darryl Weathers and
I'm with the Construction Workers' Union.

142
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:55,457
I work with a lot of fine men
who have families to feed.

143
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:57,968
Now I don't know about you all,
but we worked long and

144
00:07:58,128 --> 00:08:01,181
hard to get our pay up to a level
where we could make a decent living.

145
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,514
And now these people from
the future are showin' up...

146
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:07,439
and offerin' to do the same
work for next to nothin'!

147
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,914
They took our jobs!!

148
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:13,989
We're in the moving business!

149
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,651
Fourteen years we've been
workin' our butts off!

150
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:19,658
Now these future folk come in
and we can't get work nowhere!

151
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:21,363
They took our jobs!

152
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:22,497
They took your jobs!

153
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:26,481
Well what about us in
the fast-food business?!

154
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:30,627
The restaurants are firing us 'cause
the future people work for a lot less!

155
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,471
They took our jobs!!

156
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,464
They took your jobs!

157
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:35,675
They took your jobs!

158
00:08:35,675 --> 00:08:36,930
Too-kourderb!

159
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:38,196
It's affecting kids too!

160
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:40,376
Me and my friends started our
own snow-shoveling business.

161
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:42,479
We were trying to be responsible
and make money, you know?

162
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,297
But then the people came along and,
and now we're out of work too!

163
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:49,701
Oh, they took our jobs!!

164
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,027
They took yer jobs!!

165
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:52,271
They took yer jobs!!

166
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,302
Too-kourderb!

167
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:27,978
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock.
Where have you been?

168
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:31,059
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants
from the future coming in and tryin' tuh-

169
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:35,136
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in
the basement and our son is home.

170
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,704
Could you please set the table for dinner?

171
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:39,846
Who is that?

172
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,622
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd.

173
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,222
She's gonna help around the house
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

174
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:46,311
And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.

175
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:47,453
Oh, but that's the problem!

176
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,685
Those goobacks are taking our jobs!

177
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:50,363
What??

178
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:51,501
Oh my God!

179
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,182
Stan Marsh, how dare you use
that time-bashing slur?!

180
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:56,864
Who taught you to talk like that?!

181
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,781
Well dude, they are taking
people's jobs away.

182
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:02,657
They're only taking the small menial jobs
that nobody else really wants to do.

183
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,060
I wanted my job!

184
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:06,464
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something:

185
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,634
Those people from the future
have had a hard life!

186
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:12,047
Where they come from is dirty
and overpopulated and poor!

187
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:14,577
You can't even imagine the kind
of depression they come from!

188
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:16,831
So for us, who have everything sooo good,

189
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:19,272
to judge them, is wrong!
Do you understand?!

190
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:21,526
Next time you think about calling them goobacks,

191
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:25,517
you might just wanna stop for a second and think
about how crappy the future really is!

192
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:28,843
That's right! We're not raising our son
to be an ignorant timecist.

193
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:29,826
Timecist?

194
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,668
You know, a racist, but against people from the-

195
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,077
People from the future. Right, got it.

196
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,092
All right, good.

197
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,409
Now, let's all go eat some of
Mrs.Gruhd's great future cooking.

198
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:41,512
And now, here is Bill O'- Reilly.

199
00:10:41,512 --> 00:10:44,293
Welcome welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right?

200
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:47,393
And what we're talkin' about today are
the immigrants from the future.

201
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:48,196
All right?

202
00:10:48,196 --> 00:10:52,158
Most people are more than happy to give a helping
hand to these people who obviously need it.

203
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:52,952
All right?

204
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,366
But others are starting to say that the
time portal should be closed off.

205
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,436
All right?

206
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:00,843
Now, I've got two guests with me tonight
who have opposing views on the matter.

207
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:04,606
On my right is pissed-off white-trash
redneck conservative.

208
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:06,269
Thanks for having me, Bill.

209
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,593
And on my left is aging
hippie liberal douche.

210
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:10,462
Hello.

211
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:14,984
Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't
allow anyone else through the time portal,aright?

212
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:16,803
You're Goddamned right!

213
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:22,562
These people from the future are takin' all the work
away from us decent present-day Americans!

214
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,185
They took our jobs!

215
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,916
They took our jobs!

216
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,270
Those jobs belong to people from the present!

217
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,416
Aright. What say you,
aging hippie liberal douche

218
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:37,717
Heh it's typical for conservatives rednecks like
these to view the immigrants as the problem,

219
00:11:37,717 --> 00:11:40,505
heh, but really,the problem is America.

220
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:44,249
It is our greedy multinational corporations
that keep everyone else in poverty.

221
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,629
Your ancestors came to America as immigrants.

222
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,549
What right do you have to
turn these people away?

223
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,805
Aright, redneck, your rebuttal?

224
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,087
They took our jobs!

225
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,933
They took our jobs!

226
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,886
Too-kourderb!

227
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:08,444
All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must
now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.

228
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:09,805
What?!

229
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:12,880
So, with that in mind, let's continue
our lessons on verbs.

230
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,489
Remember that there are
transitive verbs such as...

231
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:21,797
"The boy threw the red ball,"
which in Futurespeak of course, is...

232
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,692
Everyone say it with me?

233
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,171
Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as...

234
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:37,029
"The 11:15 bus from Denver
arrived twelve hours late."

235
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:40,022
Or in Futurespeak, "Vvut. "

236
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:41,483
"Vvut. "

237
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,890
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap!

238
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,649
If they wanna live in our time,
then they should learn our language!

239
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:47,879
Yeah! That's right!

240
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,319
Hey now, these immigrants have
a right to retain their culture.

241
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:53,245
Who are we to say our language is best?

242
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:56,218
They deserve to have an education
just as much as you do.

243
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:58,549
Thank you, aging hippie liberal douche.

244
00:12:58,549 --> 00:12:59,675
You betcha.

245
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,934
Timmih.

246
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,878
Okay, now let's get back to it, kids.

247
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:05,550
What kind of verb is this?

248
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,508
"The sad girl puts balls in her mouth. "

249
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:12,804
Or, in Futurespeak of course,
"Gluch gligh balls glych gligh. "

250
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:14,727
This is bullcrap!

251
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,980
Listen up, everybody!

252
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,719
We've just received a reply
from our congressman.

253
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,991
"Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize
with you all losing your jobs.

254
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:33,612
However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone
who crosses the time border is inhumane. "

255
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,395
What? That's ridiculous!

256
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:35,452
They can't do that!

257
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:36,303
That was a good idea!

258
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:40,025
So it appears the government ain't gonna help us!

259
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:43,178
Which means we gotta take
matters into our own hands!

260
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:48,655
The only way to stop people from the future
is to stop the future from happening!

261
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:49,876
Hey that's right!

262
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:55,380
If there is no future,then there'll be no people
from the future to come back and take our jobs!

263
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,851
Take rjurbs

264
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:57,779
All right!

265
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,502
So, any ideas how we can stop
the future from happening?

266
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:09,017
How about we cause more global
warming, so that in the future,

267
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:13,742
the polar ice caps melt, and
and it ushers in a new ice age?

268
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:20,490
How the hell is global warming
gonna cause an ice age?!

269
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,821
Well you know, the...global warming could bring
on like a climate shift or somethin'?

270
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,605
Chet, you are a fuckin' retard,
you know that?!

271
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:30,986
Even if global warming were real,

272
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:33,465
which all proven scientific data shows it isn't,

273
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:37,016
it would take millions of years
for a climate shift to happen!

274
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:40,044
You think an ice age can just happen
all of a sudden-like?

275
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,200
Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.

276
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,575
Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book,
'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard!

277
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:50,398
Now, come on people, we've got to think!
Damnit, they took our jaorbs!

278
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:51,960
They took our jobs!

279
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:25,303
Aw, dude.

280
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:27,721
Gaur da'ka?

281
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:29,949
Can you speak in present-day English please?

282
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:34,094
Uh oh... Can I help... you?

283
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:37,304
Uh yeah, I want a double
cheeseburger and fries.

284
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:40,544
Chicken sandwich?

285
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,613
No, a double cheeseburger and fries!

286
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:45,137
A cheeg- fry?

287
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:45,920
What?!

288
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,710
A cheeg- fry?

289
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,277
We can't understand you, asshole!

290
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,620
Can I help you?

291
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,952
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!

292
00:15:57,972 --> 00:15:59,610
Chicken sandwich?

293
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,550
No, it's not a chicken sandwich!

294
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,604
I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some
Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!

295
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:09,153
Stan Marsh!

296
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:11,449
Aw-awwww.

297
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:17,097
Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop
these immigrants from takin' our jobs!

298
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:18,642
Hey, I got an idea.

299
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:22,583
Uh maybe we should all take off all
our clothes,scramble into a big pile

300
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,300
and start gettin' gay with each other.

301
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:28,567
Did you say "get gay"?

302
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:31,885
Hey yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!

303
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,508
What? Gettin' gay?

304
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:36,301
Think about it: These people
are from the future, right?

305
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:40,761
Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer,then
there won't be no children to have no children,

306
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:44,311
and the people from the future
won't exist to take our jobs!

307
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:46,914
I ain't turnin' queer.

308
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,267
You have to, Jimbo,

309
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:51,478
or else we won't be able to stop them!
Damn it, they too 'r jaobs!

310
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,188
Yeah, they took our jobs!

311
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:54,573
Took our jobs!

312
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:58,679
Let's go over to that part of town that
all the future people moved into

313
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,689
and start humpin' each
other until they disappear!

314
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,489
Come on!

315
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,318
Come on! You want your jobs back or not?!

316
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,446
All right, you future bastards!

317
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,406
Think you can take our jubs?!

318
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:24,011
Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!.

319
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,019
How do you like that, gooback?!

320
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,172
Come on, you guys!

321
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:42,295
Everyone who believes in America,
join in with us!

322
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,250
We're gonna make these
future bastards nonexistent!

323
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,239
Aw, come on, Dad! How come
I have to go to work with you?

324
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,366
Because you're being grounded, Stanley!

325
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,784
Now I don't wanna hear another
word out of your intolerant mouth!

326
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,382
You just sit right there, Stanley, and
you thnk about what you've done!

327
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:05,831
You'll find all the copiers and printers
in the next room over and then uh-

328
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:06,901
Hey, Mr. Nelson.

329
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,696
Oh... R-Randy...

330
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,635
Uh I'm surprised to see you here.

331
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:12,080
Why? This is my office.

332
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,917
Ooohh boy, didn't you get
my phone message?

333
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,873
Ooo, this is awkward.
Well, the thing is, Randy,

334
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:19,498
you've been- replaced.

335
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,419
What?

336
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,211
Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows
geology and he offered to work for next to nothing.

337
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,362
Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk.

338
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:27,783
Gheglo.

339
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,907
You can't be serious.

340
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:32,833
I'm... sssorry, Randy. It's just,
with all the budget cuts and all,

341
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,804
we'll give you some time
to clean out your desk.

342
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:37,308
Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk.

343
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,608
I'll show you to the coffee room.

344
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:45,844
Oh my God. They took my jarb!!

345
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,632
They took yer jarb!!

346
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,482
This is CNN.

347
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:53,305
Breaking news at the time border.
We go now live to Harrison Moore.

348
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:58,632
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where
some kind of mass protest has broken out.

349
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:04,329
Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time
immigrants are here having sex with one another.

350
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:08,215
These men have apparently sucked and
screwed their way across the state

351
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,726
and are now here at the time border
trying to get national attention.

352
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:15,002
These unemployed men have been
having sex for several days.

353
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:18,323
Joining me is their spokesperson,
Randy Marsh.

354
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:21,740
Mr. Marsh, what exactly are
you trying to accomplish?

355
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,110
We're doing the only thing we can do.

356
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,710
If our government is just gonna let
anybody into our time who wants to come,

357
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,071
then we have to take matters
into our own hands.

358
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:33,573
We're trying to turn everyone gay
so that there are no future humans!

359
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,583
Present-day America Number One!

360
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,680
Yeah America!

361
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,123
Take our jobs!

362
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:43,011
Do you really think you can get enough people to
turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?

363
00:19:43,011 --> 00:19:44,937
All we can do is try, Harrison.

364
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:48,624
Trying to stop immigration is
intolerant and ignorant.

365
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:51,062
Those immigrants have a right
to pursue happiness.

366
00:19:51,062 --> 00:19:52,954
Young man, what do you
think about all this?

367
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:57,076
I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks
because they're no different from us.

368
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:59,280
They're just humans trying to
make their lives better.

369
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,915
Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time
is so crappy,

370
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:04,795
but the cold hard truth is that if we
let them all come back to our time,

371
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,665
then it's just gonna make
our time crappy too.

372
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:09,728
Maybe the answer isn't trying
to stop the future from happening,

373
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:11,369
but making the future better.

374
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:13,832
Huh?

375
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:16,862
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now
to working toward a better future,

376
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:18,645
then, then the future won't be so bad,

377
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:21,071
and, these immigrants won't need
to come back here looking for work.

378
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:24,606
Hey. He's right.

379
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:28,408
If we build for a better future,
the immigrants will stay there.

380
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:29,727
Yeah.

381
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,581
We've got to start working
towards a brighter tomorrow.

382
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:34,061
Well what are we waiting for?

383
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,754
We've got to work for a better future,

384
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:43,451
we've got to join hands for tomorrow.

385
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,769
Take the first step and you will see

386
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:48,368
the future begins with you and me.

387
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:52,351
We can start to make a difference

388
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,679
if we want it for our children

389
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,893
Recycle that can and plant that tree,

390
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:59,857
'cause the future begins with you and me.

391
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,849
Look, it's working!

392
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:04,413
The future begins with you and me.

393
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,176
The immigrants are fadin' away!

394
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,264
We're doing it!

395
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:10,432
We've got to work for a better future,

396
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:12,756
we've got to join hands for tomorrow.

397
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,118
Take the first step and you will see...

398
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,418
Dude, wait wait ho, hold on.
Wait a second.

399
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:18,926
This is gay.

400
00:21:18,926 --> 00:21:20,174
This is really gay.

401
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:24,041
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting
in a big pile and having sex with each other.

402
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,805
Okay, sorry, my bad,
e- everyone back in the pile.

403
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:28,390
Back in the pile everyone!

404
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,628
We're going back to the pile.

405
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:30,281
Jump in!

406
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,025
Come on, everybody!

407
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,282
Never mind, we're going back to the pile!

408
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,951
Took ur jurb!

409
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:38,854
