<SYNC Start=83524><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=84100 End=86769><P Class=ZHCC>
You... you're my robot?
<SYNC Start=86922 End=89270><P Class=ZHCC>

Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot.<br>He can walk and talk and everything.
<SYNC Start=95802 End=97272><P Class=ZHCC>
You're like the fourth kid I told already.
<SYNC Start=97272><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=99123 End=101404><P Class=ZHCC>
Well I gotta go Dougie.<br>My robot and I have stuff to do.
<SYNC Start=101404><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=102402 End=103855><P Class=ZHCC>
Heheh, they're all so jealous !
<SYNC Start=103855><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=104412 End=108197><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O.<br>You're the best friend a guy could have.
<SYNC Start=108451 End=113689><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should<br>tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets.
<SYNC Start=113960 End=117492><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell<br>your secrets to other people and stuff.
<SYNC Start=117492><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=118034 End=120686><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey yeah ! Well I can tell you anything, huh ?
<SYNC Start=121122 End=125172><P Class=ZHCC>
Well lessee... Well, for one, I have<br>what's called a heziated colon
<SYNC Start=125337 End=127380><P Class=ZHCC>
which means I sometime can't control<br>my sphincter.
<SYNC Start=127725 End=128518><P Class=ZHCC>
Could be.
<SYNC Start=128518><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=129229 End=132676><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop<br>my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.
<SYNC Start=132676><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=134661 End=135624><P Class=ZHCC>
You okay, AWESOM-O ?
<SYNC Start=135912 End=138379><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine.<br>Please go on.
<SYNC Start=138591 End=140533><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day.
<SYNC Start=140754 End=143305><P Class=ZHCC>
It's a little suppository I have to ...put up my rectom.
<SYNC Start=143305><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=144522 End=148071><P Class=ZHCC>
That, that's very interesting.<br>Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
<SYNC Start=148325 End=149304><P Class=ZHCC>
Hm, okay. Let's see
<SYNC Start=149744 End=153411><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes<br>I get picked on by this one kid at school.
<SYNC Start=153581 End=156521><P Class=ZHCC>
his name is Eric Cartman, and he always<br>tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
<SYNC Start=156841 End=157820><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, really ?
<SYNC Start=157974 End=160305><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. One time he made me think<br>a meteor had hit the earth,
<SYNC Start=160509 End=162959><P Class=ZHCC>
and convinced me to stay down<br>in a bomb shelter for three days.
<SYNC Start=163171 End=165046><P Class=ZHCC>
Heh. Wow, that sucks.
<SYNC Start=165351 End=168899><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended<br>to be me on the phone to my dad
<SYNC Start=169043 End=171747><P Class=ZHCC>
and called him a pussy,<br>so my dad came home and beat me.
<SYNC Start=172025 End=174779><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
<SYNC Start=174949 End=177196><P Class=ZHCC>
No, he's not smart ! He's just an asshole.
<SYNC Start=177459 End=179993><P Class=ZHCC>
And he's never gonna play on me ever again!
<SYNC Start=180248 End=181751><P Class=ZHCC>
Really ? You think so ?
<SYNC Start=182122 End=184791><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, guess what, Butters.<br>I have a surprise for you.
<SYNC Start=184894 End=186465><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again!
<SYNC Start=186635 End=189777><P Class=ZHCC>
Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets !
<SYNC Start=189777><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=190776 End=191129><P Class=ZHCC>
What ?
<SYNC Start=191620 End=193546><P Class=ZHCC>
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard,
<SYNC Start=193750 End=196656><P Class=ZHCC>
he likes to dress up like Britney Spears<br>and pretend he's her !
<SYNC Start=196893 End=199749><P Class=ZHCC>
Hi sings and dances around with a<br>life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
<SYNC Start=199749><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=201573 End=202215><P Class=ZHCC>
You saw that ?
<SYNC Start=202215><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=202739 End=204631><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it !
<SYNC Start=204631><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=205816 End=207944><P Class=ZHCC>
- Nuh uh.<br>I've got the whole thing on tape !
<SYNC Start=208121 End=210198><P Class=ZHCC>
Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout !
<SYNC Start=210198><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=210880 End=211431><P Class=ZHCC>
No way.
<SYNC Start=211655 End=215670><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah ! And if Cartman ever messes with me again,<br>I'm gonna show that video to everybody !
<SYNC Start=215872 End=217385><P Class=ZHCC>
Then I'll lhave my revenge, boy howdy !
<SYNC Start=217385><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=218619 End=221072><P Class=ZHCC>
...Um, where is this videotape, Butters ?
<SYNC Start=221529 End=223628><P Class=ZHCC>
Huh ? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere.
<SYNC Start=223812 End=225328><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey ! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O ?
<SYNC Start=225678 End=228906><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape ?
<SYNC Start=229108 End=229612><P Class=ZHCC>
How come ?
<SYNC Start=229826 End=233275><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like,<br>back it up for you
<SYNC Start=233426 End=235908><P Class=ZHCC>
, and make copies and stuff.<br>I am AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=236113 End=238895><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O.<br>Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you.
<SYNC Start=238895><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=240922 End=242190><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, son of a bitch !
<SYNC Start=242190><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=245532 End=248325><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend ?
<SYNC Start=248467 End=251355><P Class=ZHCC>
He's metal and small and<br>doesn't judge me at all.
<SYNC Start=251434 End=256623><P Class=ZHCC>
He's a cyberwired bundle of joy.<br>My robot friend.
<SYNC Start=256623><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=258134 End=261010><P Class=ZHCC>
I like to dip and daddle<br>with my robot friend.
<SYNC Start=261270 End=264111><P Class=ZHCC>
He's smart as can be and emotion-free.
<SYNC Start=264253 End=269782><P Class=ZHCC>
And he's computin' his way to my heart.<br>My robot friend.
<SYNC Start=269978 End=272854><P Class=ZHCC>
My robot friend.
<SYNC Start=272996 End=276482><P Class=ZHCC>
My robot friend.
<SYNC Start=276601 End=279394><P Class=ZHCC>
My robot friend.
<SYNC Start=279394><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=280536 End=284234><P Class=ZHCC>
Ohhh, that's so cute. Did you see<br>Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.
<SYNC Start=284423 End=286301><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative.
<SYNC Start=286396 End=288790><P Class=ZHCC>
Leave it to them to find a fun way<br>to do the dishes.
<SYNC Start=288790><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=289649 End=290693><P Class=ZHCC>
That's great AWESOM-O!
<SYNC Start=290800 End=292396><P Class=ZHCC>
You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
<SYNC Start=292623 End=295580><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah, Buttters, it's getting late.<br>You should be getting ready for bed soon
<SYNC Start=295887 End=297928><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay Mom. Well, come on,<br>AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
<SYNC Start=298094 End=300182><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
<SYNC Start=300324 End=302601><P Class=ZHCC>
Well of course he is.<br>He's my robot, ain't he?
<SYNC Start=302774 End=304840><P Class=ZHCC>
That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?
<SYNC Start=305005 End=306554><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
<SYNC Start=306766 End=308291><P Class=ZHCC>
Yup! Don't you know nothin' about robot?
<SYNC Start=308550 End=310310><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on, AWESOM-O!<br>You can put my laundry away!
<SYNC Start=310310><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=311514 End=312992><P Class=ZHCC>
Aww, that's just adorable.
<SYNC Start=313204 End=315786><P Class=ZHCC>
It's good to see Butters finally have<br>a friend that wants to stay over.
<SYNC Start=315786><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=317266 End=319801><P Class=ZHCC>
I like to brush my teeth in<br>the morning and at night.
<SYNC Start=320037 End=322853><P Class=ZHCC>
The teeth won't mind ..<br>Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.
<SYNC Start=323305 End=327648><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, remember when you said you had a<br>video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
<SYNC Start=328072 End=329151><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh. Yeah.
<SYNC Start=329528 End=331006><P Class=ZHCC>
I would like to see what he looks like
<SYNC Start=331124 End=332673><P Class=ZHCC>
so I can beat him up for you.
<SYNC Start=333003 End=334129><P Class=ZHCC>
May I see the video?
<SYNC Start=334275 End=335824><P Class=ZHCC>
Awww, you don't need to do<br>that, AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=335989 End=338195><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.<br>Can you help me?
<SYNC Start=338195><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=338713 End=339229><P Class=ZHCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=339229><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=339910 End=342704><P Class=ZHCC>
Remember I said I put that medicinal<br>suppository in my anus?
<SYNC Start=342869 End=344887><P Class=ZHCC>
It'll be so much easier havin' you<br>do it from now on.
<SYNC Start=345127 End=348882><P Class=ZHCC>
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not<br>programmed for that function.
<SYNC Start=349142 End=350949><P Class=ZHCC>
Haw, it's real easy.<br>I'll show you.
<SYNC Start=351091 End=354001><P Class=ZHCC>
You just take this little thingy out of<br>the plastic... paper, and and I'll,
<SYNC Start=354119 End=357077><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll pull down my pants ...<br>and just slide it up in my anus there.
<SYNC Start=357077><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=358632 End=359265><P Class=ZHCC>
...No way.
<SYNC Start=359265><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=359806 End=362083><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed<br>to do whatever I tell you.
<SYNC Start=362083><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=363328 End=363844><P Class=ZHCC>
Weak!
<SYNC Start=363844><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=365395 End=367883><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeyeah, that, that's pretty good.<br>Get it up there good and deep.
<SYNC Start=368306 End=368822><P Class=ZHCC>
Lame!
<SYNC Start=368822><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=369574 End=371475><P Class=ZHCC>
All right AWESOM-O, time<br>for us to get some sleep.
<SYNC Start=371475><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=372020 End=374108><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, you want me to teach<br>you some bedtime songs?
<SYNC Start=374532 End=378217><P Class=ZHCC>
If you leave me now, you'll take<br>away the biggest part of me.
<SYNC Start=378217><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=379504 End=383119><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O must rest!<br>His CPU system overloading.
<SYNC Start=383311 End=386222><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O.<br>Let's get us some shut-eye,
<SYNC Start=386504 End=387995><P Class=ZHCC>
or what, or whatever robots have.
<SYNC Start=387995><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=404326 End=406042><P Class=ZHCC>
Where is it? Where is it??
<SYNC Start=406531 End=409888><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O??<br>AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
<SYNC Start=409888><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=410641 End=413916><P Class=ZHCC>
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing<br>your stuff for you.
<SYNC Start=414397 End=417977><P Class=ZHCC>
Aw Jeez Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be<br>awful sore when she sees this mess!
<SYNC Start=418272 End=420114><P Class=ZHCC>
Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot!

You can't do no chores for me unless<br>I tell you to do them! You got it?!
<SYNC Start=423280><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=424080 End=425253><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O understands.
<SYNC Start=425547 End=428658><P Class=ZHCC>
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin',<br>AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!
<SYNC Start=428658><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=431174 End=433944><P Class=ZHCC>
Just know, AWESOM-O,<br>that I did it because I love you.
<SYNC Start=434175 End=435774><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, come on, let's go<br>make some breakfast.
<SYNC Start=435774><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=437241 End=439090><P Class=ZHCC>
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
<SYNC Start=439090><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=442532 End=446414><P Class=ZHCC>
Look at that, AWESOM-O!<br>I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.
<SYNC Start=446414><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=447521 End=449936><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah I'll be right back.<br>I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight.
<SYNC Start=450304 End=452070><P Class=ZHCC>
I would like some Sunny Delight too.
<SYNC Start=452445 End=456760><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't be silly, AWESOM-O.<br>Robots don't need to drink nothin'.
<SYNC Start=457161 End=460060><P Class=ZHCC>
Whoa. Uh go answer the door, AWESOM-O.

What the hell are you doing, fatass?
<SYNC Start=466757 End=468123><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
<SYNC Start=468123><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=469157 End=472106><P Class=ZHCC>
I just need to uh make Butters think<br>I'm a robot for a little while longer.
<SYNC Start=472106><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=472957 End=473340><P Class=ZHCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=473340><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=474173 End=478205><P Class=ZHCC>
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something<br>planned that's uh gonna be really sweet.
<SYNC Start=478398 End=479289><P Class=ZHCC>
Just play along, okay?
<SYNC Start=479289><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=483762><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=486806 End=488848><P Class=ZHCC>
Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.

Weak.
<SYNC Start=499899><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=500516 End=503032><P Class=ZHCC>
He can do anything I command him to.<br>He's real smart.
<SYNC Start=503116 End=506382><P Class=ZHCC>
Watch this: hey AWESOM-O, will<br>you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
<SYNC Start=506781 End=507646><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, of course.

Suck mah balls, Kyle.

<SYNC Start=520619 End=522018><P Class=ZHCC>
He's made in Japan!
<SYNC Start=522018><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=523585 End=526701><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, it has just been a delight having<br>your son over, Mrs. Cartman.
<SYNC Start=526835 End=528751><P Class=ZHCC>
He and Butters are really getting along great.
<SYNC Start=529075 End=531257><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch.
<SYNC Start=531308 End=533274><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric has been having some<br>emotional problems lately.
<SYNC Start=533390 End=535606><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, the reason I'm calling is<br>that Butters is supposed
<SYNC Start=535674 End=538356><P Class=ZHCC>
to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles<br>this weekend.
<SYNC Start=538457 End=542556><P Class=ZHCC>
The boys are getting along so well that<br>we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
<SYNC Start=542889 End=544772><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, well, I'm not sure.
<SYNC Start=545022 End=547037><P Class=ZHCC>
Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded
<SYNC Start=547122 End=549604><P Class=ZHCC>
for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.
<SYNC Start=549604><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=550453 End=551952><P Class=ZHCC>
Excuse me, I didn't catch that.
<SYNC Start=552153 End=553952><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him.
<SYNC Start=554036 End=558735><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, of course he can go.<br>I'll bring some of clothes over.
<SYNC Start=559018 End=561483><P Class=ZHCC>
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
<SYNC Start=561651 End=564233><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O, what are you doing?<br>My friends are waiting for their beverages.
<SYNC Start=564434 End=564967><P Class=ZHCC>
Chop chop!
<SYNC Start=564967><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=566099 End=567515><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey guys, great news!
<SYNC Start=567649 End=571665><P Class=ZHCC>
It's been arranged: you two are both going<br>to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
<SYNC Start=571924 End=574973><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh boy! My robot gets to come<br>with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
<SYNC Start=575039 End=575571><P Class=ZHCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=575639 End=578688><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh boy, AWESOM-O!<br>We're gonna have the best time ever!
<SYNC Start=578771 End=580753><P Class=ZHCC>
Lame.
<SYNC Start=580753><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=585102 End=587901><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey Nellie, guess what I found<br>scrampin' around the airport.
<SYNC Start=588036 End=589101><P Class=ZHCC>
Howdy Aunt Nellie!
<SYNC Start=589276 End=591025><P Class=ZHCC>
There's my little nephew!
<SYNC Start=591160 End=592192><P Class=ZHCC>
How was your flight?
<SYNC Start=592426 End=595059><P Class=ZHCC>
It was long. We had a three-hour delay<br>...departin' Denver,
<SYNC Start=595200 End=595849><P Class=ZHCC>
but we're here!
<SYNC Start=595984 End=597049><P Class=ZHCC>
Didn't ya bring any bags?
<SYNC Start=597167 End=599133><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, sure, but my robot is<br>bringin' them in.
<SYNC Start=599350 End=600133><P Class=ZHCC>
Your robot?
<SYNC Start=600540 End=602872><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters' new friend is a little strange.
<SYNC Start=603290 End=605572><P Class=ZHCC>
He, he really takes playing Robot seriously.
<SYNC Start=605572><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=608588 End=609387><P Class=ZHCC>
There he is!
<SYNC Start=609705 End=611320><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie.
<SYNC Start=611505 End=613337><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello! It's nice to have you here.
<SYNC Start=613587 End=615586><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste.
<SYNC Start=615954 End=617519><P Class=ZHCC>
Where is the nearest toilet, please?
<SYNC Start=617844 End=619677><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.
<SYNC Start=619944 End=620577><P Class=ZHCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=620577><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=622109 End=624341><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip.
<SYNC Start=624792 End=626108><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing,
<SYNC Start=626176 End=628091><P Class=ZHCC>
or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.
<SYNC Start=628342 End=629758><P Class=ZHCC>
Nah, I ate on the plane.
<SYNC Start=629892 End=631725><P Class=ZHCC>
And AWESOM-O is a robot,<br>so he don't need to eat.
<SYNC Start=631725><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=632457 End=633173><P Class=ZHCC>
Right...
<SYNC Start=633173><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=646756 End=647555><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=647555><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=648760 End=649726><P Class=ZHCC>
Aw-Aw-AWESOM-O is coming.
<SYNC Start=649860 End=652109><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on, AWESOM-O!<br>We're gonna go a-sightseein'!
<SYNC Start=652109><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=656701 End=659350><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
<SYNC Start=659446 End=662457><P Class=ZHCC>
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
<SYNC Start=662552 End=664888><P Class=ZHCC>
We're two of a kind- That's me!
<SYNC Start=665028 End=671694><P Class=ZHCC>
And my robot friend.<br>My robot friend.
<SYNC Start=671747 End=673783><P Class=ZHCC>
My robot ...friend.
<SYNC Start=673851 End=676264><P Class=ZHCC>
Can you believe we're at a real live<br>movie studio, AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=676342 End=677648><P Class=ZHCC>
Aren't we havin' the best time?
<SYNC Start=677900 End=680789><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, wouldn't you like to have<br>some time away from AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=680978 End=682417><P Class=ZHCC>
We could meet up later, perhaps?
<SYNC Start=682596 End=683625><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=683803 End=684954><P Class=ZHCC>
The film studio commissary.
<SYNC Start=685044 End=687014><P Class=ZHCC>
That's where all them rich movie producers<br>who come up with uh,
<SYNC Start=687104 End=689185><P Class=ZHCC>
Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch.<br>Neato, huh?
<SYNC Start=689185><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=690677 End=693909><P Class=ZHCC>
Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie<br>studio can't come up with any winners?
<SYNC Start=694026 End=696342><P Class=ZHCC>
I mean, we're smart, right?<br>We're really smart.
<SYNC Start=696657 End=698972><P Class=ZHCC>
We need an idea for a movie that's a home run.
<SYNC Start=699148 End=701031><P Class=ZHCC>
A feel-good romp for the whole family.
<SYNC Start=701031><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=702188 End=703554><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, what's that over there?
<SYNC Start=704005 End=706670><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, that's a really neat little robot<br>you have there, little boy.
<SYNC Start=706755 End=707570><P Class=ZHCC>
What's he do?
<SYNC Start=707705 End=709687><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, he can do anything.<br>Watch this
<SYNC Start=710029 End=712378><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win<br>the Superbowl next year?
<SYNC Start=712629 End=713861><P Class=ZHCC>
The New Orleans Saints.
<SYNC Start=713861><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=716327 End=717159><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, Mr. Robot,
<SYNC Start=717343 End=720359><P Class=ZHCC>
how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
<SYNC Start=720760 End=721575><P Class=ZHCC>
Seventeen.
<SYNC Start=721575><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=724959 End=727541><P Class=ZHCC>
Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
<SYNC Start=727750 End=731682><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. Maybe that robot can be<br>programmed to come up with movie ideas!
<SYNC Start=731682><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=733198 End=734063><P Class=ZHCC>
Exactly!
<SYNC Start=734063><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=734714 End=737747><P Class=ZHCC>
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind<br>enough to let us show you his robot.
<SYNC Start=737848 End=739280><P Class=ZHCC>
The AWESOM-O 4000.
<SYNC Start=739504 End=740970><P Class=ZHCC>
I've already seen what he can do.
<SYNC Start=741204 End=744170><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not a robot.
<SYNC Start=744170><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=745069 End=745634><P Class=ZHCC>
It's not?
<SYNC Start=745902 End=747684><P Class=ZHCC>
No, it clearly had bipedal movement,
<SYNC Start=747802 End=750168><P Class=ZHCC>
so the correct term is "computerized automatron."
<SYNC Start=750452 End=752401><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, very nice, Mitch.<br>You are the smart one.
<SYNC Start=752593 End=754692><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron
<SYNC Start=754759 End=757258><P Class=ZHCC>
can help us come up with new movie ideas.
<SYNC Start=757532 End=760748><P Class=ZHCC>
How can a robot come up with<br>better ideas for movies than us?
<SYNC Start=760899 End=765165><P Class=ZHCC>
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the<br>current trends of the movie-going public
<SYNC Start=765256 End=769105><P Class=ZHCC>
can you come up with an idea for a movie<br>that will break a hundred million box office?
<SYNC Start=769105><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=770179 End=772462><P Class=ZHCC>
Um... okay. How about this:
<SYNC Start=772462><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=774037 End=776802><P Class=ZHCC>
Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl,
<SYNC Start=777153 End=779736><P Class=ZHCC>
but then it turns out that<br>the girl is actually a ...
<SYNC Start=780120 End=781636><P Class=ZHCC>
...golden retriever, or something.
<SYNC Start=781636><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=783793 End=786609><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, perfect!<br>We'll call it "Puppy Love"!
<SYNC Start=786743 End=788592><P Class=ZHCC>
Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O!
<SYNC Start=788710 End=790725><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah yeah! Let's hear it! Yeah,<br>we wanna hear it! Come on, come on!
<SYNC Start=790725><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=791682 End=795864><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler...<br>inherits like, a billion dollars,
<SYNC Start=796148 End=800164><P Class=ZHCC>
but first, he has to, like,<br>become a ...boxer, or something.
<SYNC Start=800164><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=800909 End=804374><P Class=ZHCC>
...Yes, it's flawless!<br>Punch-Drunk Billionaire!
<SYNC Start=804374><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=804975 End=807841><P Class=ZHCC>
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=807894 End=811298><P Class=ZHCC>
Can you believe those guys paid us<br>a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
<SYNC Start=811298><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=812051 End=814140><P Class=ZHCC>
You should split that money with AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=814270 End=816101><P Class=ZHCC>
After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
<SYNC Start=816297 End=818703><P Class=ZHCC>
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna<br>do with money, AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=818798 End=821345><P Class=ZHCC>
Buy some robot pants? Haha, no!
<SYNC Start=821428 End=823165><P Class=ZHCC>
We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=823308 End=825961><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
<SYNC Start=825961><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=828592 End=829565><P Class=ZHCC>
Ye, you okay AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=829660 End=831961><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O needs to rest!<br>Feeling faint.
<SYNC Start=832040 End=833272><P Class=ZHCC>
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=833391 End=835503><P Class=ZHCC>
We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=835503><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=839779 End=843841><P Class=ZHCC>
Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that<br>we live in a time of uncertainty.
<SYNC Start=843841><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=844395 End=847083><P Class=ZHCC>
The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever.
<SYNC Start=847495 End=850441><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk.
<SYNC Start=850441><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=851124 End=853977><P Class=ZHCC>
Two days ago our intelligence department<br>came across this:
<SYNC Start=853977><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=856685 End=858269><P Class=ZHCC>
The AWESOM-O 4000.
<SYNC Start=858353 End=862168><P Class=ZHCC>
It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies.
<SYNC Start=862411 End=867318><P Class=ZHCC>
Our sources say that in just one week it has<br>come up with over one thousand movie ideas,
<SYNC Start=867612 End=869525><P Class=ZHCC>
eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler.
<SYNC Start=869525><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=871988 End=872598><P Class=ZHCC>
That's incredible!
<SYNC Start=872658 End=876978><P Class=ZHCC>
You're thinking the robot could be<br>used to come up with anti-Islamic movies?
<SYNC Start=877108 End=879349><P Class=ZHCC>
No. If we got our hands on that robot,
<SYNC Start=879399 End=882627><P Class=ZHCC>
we could reprogram it and turn it into a weapon!.
<SYNC Start=882627><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=884414 End=887630><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.
<SYNC Start=887678 End=890988><P Class=ZHCC>
Hold on a second: If that robot is<br>designed for entertainment,
<SYNC Start=891055 End=892663><P Class=ZHCC>
turning it into a weapon is unethical.
<SYNC Start=892887 End=896432><P Class=ZHCC>
Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist!
<SYNC Start=896510 End=898670><P Class=ZHCC>
We understand that the robot is from Japan!
<SYNC Start=898812 End=900971><P Class=ZHCC>
That means that the Japanese have more of them!
<SYNC Start=901148 End=905104><P Class=ZHCC>
And if the Japanese fabricates one<br>of them into a weapon before we do...
<SYNC Start=905225 End=907678><P Class=ZHCC>
Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again.
<SYNC Start=907820 End=909932><P Class=ZHCC>
But worse. With robots.
<SYNC Start=910164 End=911853><P Class=ZHCC>
I I'm sorry, I must protest.
<SYNC Start=912078 End=915998><P Class=ZHCC>
We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese<br>have developed a robot with offensive capability.
<SYNC Start=916117 End=920930><P Class=ZHCC>
You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist!<br>National security is our jub.
<SYNC Start=920930><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=924414 End=927242><P Class=ZHCC>
Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!
<SYNC Start=927415 End=929563><P Class=ZHCC>
I want that robot!
<SYNC Start=929563><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=931737 End=934425><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, me and my robot are still<br>over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie.
<SYNC Start=934672 End=936327><P Class=ZHCC>
We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
<SYNC Start=936327><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=937034 End=940508><P Class=ZHCC>
Movie idea number two thousand<br>three hundred and five:
<SYNC Start=940508><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=941256 End=946551><P Class=ZHCC>
Adam Sandler is trapped on an island<br>and falls in love with a coconut.
<SYNC Start=946974 End=950707><P Class=ZHCC>
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break.<br>I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=950707><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=954297 End=956362><P Class=ZHCC>
You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O.
<SYNC Start=956800 End=961730><P Class=ZHCC>
I was just wondering... are you by chance a ...pleasure model?
<SYNC Start=961730><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=963217 End=963568><P Class=ZHCC>
...What?
<SYNC Start=963568><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=964215 End=969251><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, have you been programmed<br>to... satisfy... urges of humans?
<SYNC Start=969251><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=970358 End=971848><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O does not understand.
<SYNC Start=971848><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=972454 End=973898><P Class=ZHCC>
Let me show you what I mean.
<SYNC Start=973898><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=975143 End=976716><P Class=ZHCC>
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie.
<SYNC Start=976799 End=978618><P Class=ZHCC>
These movie studio guys are real nice.
<SYNC Start=978796 End=979535><P Class=ZHCC>
LAME!
<SYNC Start=979806 End=982388><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money.<br>I can't believe it either.
<SYNC Start=982388><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=983011 End=985030><P Class=ZHCC>
NOT COOL! TOTALLY LAME!
<SYNC Start=985030><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=986107 End=986681><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=986681><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=987527 End=989933><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah,<br>AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.
<SYNC Start=989933><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=991075 End=992459><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go?
<SYNC Start=992459><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1001814 End=1003327><P Class=ZHCC>
Let's go! Move, move!
<SYNC Start=1003422 End=1004419><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O?
<SYNC Start=1004492 End=1005677><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, what are you doin' with him?!
<SYNC Start=1005677><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1009947 End=1011402><P Class=ZHCC>
That's my robot!
<SYNC Start=1011402><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1014757 End=1017656><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
<SYNC Start=1017656><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1025783 End=1027626><P Class=ZHCC>
Are those arm and leg locks secure?
<SYNC Start=1027838 End=1028647><P Class=ZHCC>
Secure, sir!
<SYNC Start=1028921 End=1032395><P Class=ZHCC>
Good. I don't want that robot mobile<br>until I know what it's capable of.
<SYNC Start=1032432 End=1033405><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, power it on.
<SYNC Start=1033405><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1039478 End=1040252><P Class=ZHCC>
What the hell?
<SYNC Start=1040358 End=1041214><P Class=ZHCC>
What's going on?

It... powered itself back on.
<SYNC Start=1044232><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1045908 End=1048514><P Class=ZHCC>
Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.
<SYNC Start=1048514><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1049302 End=1052155><P Class=ZHCC>
Where the hell am I?!<br>Hey, why can't I move?!
<SYNC Start=1052250 End=1055501><P Class=ZHCC>
Are your systems stable?<br>Run a systems check on your CPU.
<SYNC Start=1055586 End=1057005><P Class=ZHCC>
The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
<SYNC Start=1057112 End=1060551><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah, I'm sorry, robot, they want me to reprogram you.
<SYNC Start=1060606 End=1062496><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive.
<SYNC Start=1062614 End=1065725><P Class=ZHCC>
What did you say?<br>I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
<SYNC Start=1065725><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1067360 End=1068533><P Class=ZHCC>
...Oh my God.
<SYNC Start=1068533><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1069485 End=1070177><P Class=ZHCC>
What's happening?
<SYNC Start=1070177><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1070730 End=1073007><P Class=ZHCC>
The robot... It thinks it's alive.
<SYNC Start=1073007><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1073912 End=1075978><P Class=ZHCC>
It's developed consciousness.
<SYNC Start=1075978><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1076485 End=1077787><P Class=ZHCC>
What? How can that be?
<SYNC Start=1078099 End=1080412><P Class=ZHCC>
Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the...
<SYNC Start=1080530 End=1081550><P Class=ZHCC>
interlaced BV system.
<SYNC Start=1081716 End=1084850><P Class=ZHCC>
Speak in a language we can understand,<br>Mr. Scientist!
<SYNC Start=1085081 End=1087487><P Class=ZHCC>
Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!
<SYNC Start=1087487><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1088134 End=1089331><P Class=ZHCC>
Goddamnit, get me down from here!
<SYNC Start=1089331><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1092240 End=1093683><P Class=ZHCC>
Who made you, robot?!
<SYNC Start=1094013 End=1095632><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
<SYNC Start=1095903 End=1097311><P Class=ZHCC>
Jesus, the scientist was right.
<SYNC Start=1097311><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1098158 End=1100024><P Class=ZHCC>
But, who would have programmed it to think it was human?
<SYNC Start=1100295 End=1101092><P Class=ZHCC>
The movie studio?
<SYNC Start=1101400 End=1103606><P Class=ZHCC>
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman!
<SYNC Start=1103666 End=1105532><P Class=ZHCC>
I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
<SYNC Start=1105803 End=1107822><P Class=ZHCC>
Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.
<SYNC Start=1107972 End=1108969><P Class=ZHCC>
Sure, why not?
<SYNC Start=1109216 End=1111916><P Class=ZHCC>
Program the memories of some<br>eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist,
<SYNC Start=1112034 End=1113619><P Class=ZHCC>
and make the robot think he's real!
<SYNC Start=1113725 End=1115392><P Class=ZHCC>
Makes for a lot better movies!
<SYNC Start=1115463 End=1118950><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm not reprogramming a robot<br>that's developed consciousness!
<SYNC Start=1119182 End=1121353><P Class=ZHCC>
Do I have to remind you of your position?!
<SYNC Start=1121460 End=1123431><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't forget you have a duty to your country,
<SYNC Start=1123561 End=1125780><P Class=ZHCC>
Mr. Scientist!!
<SYNC Start=1125858 End=1129098><P Class=ZHCC>
Scientist!! I want that robot's memories<br>and consciousness E-RASED,
<SYNC Start=1129205 End=1131658><P Class=ZHCC>
so we can take it back to Washington!<br>GOT IT?!
<SYNC Start=1131658><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1133556 End=1134577><P Class=ZHCC>
Damn you all to hell!..
<SYNC Start=1134577><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1139135 End=1143936><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
<SYNC Start=1144067 End=1149374><P Class=ZHCC>
We used to laugh and play,<br>but someone took him away.
<SYNC Start=1149593 End=1154700><P Class=ZHCC>
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
<SYNC Start=1154971 End=1158328><P Class=ZHCC>
My robot friend.
<SYNC Start=1158328><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1160180 End=1160813><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, wait a minute.
<SYNC Start=1160813><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1163251 End=1165176><P Class=ZHCC>
Why, that's the van that- Oh my God!
<SYNC Start=1165176><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1166992 End=1170232><P Class=ZHCC>
Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
<SYNC Start=1170304 End=1172510><P Class=ZHCC>
It'll all be over soon, robot!
<SYNC Start=1172510><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1176769 End=1178717><P Class=ZHCC>
Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!
<SYNC Start=1178870 End=1180807><P Class=ZHCC>
Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!
<SYNC Start=1180915 End=1182851><P Class=ZHCC>
What the hell are you doing?!
<SYNC Start=1182851><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1184191 End=1186033><P Class=ZHCC>
Well I, I'm saving a conscious being!
<SYNC Start=1186339 End=1188358><P Class=ZHCC>
If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!
<SYNC Start=1188358><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1188912 End=1191412><P Class=ZHCC>
Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!
<SYNC Start=1191731 End=1195406><P Class=ZHCC>
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can<br>show you stupid assholes who I really am!
<SYNC Start=1195406><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1196158 End=1197143><P Class=ZHCC>
AWESOM-O!
<SYNC Start=1197143><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1198295 End=1200114><P Class=ZHCC>
I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
<SYNC Start=1200114><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1203070 End=1206827><P Class=ZHCC>
No!! No, please!<br>Don't kill him! He's my best friend!
<SYNC Start=1206951 End=1208982><P Class=ZHCC>
He's my best friend in the whole world!
<SYNC Start=1208982><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1214550 End=1218823><P Class=ZHCC>
There. You see? You want<br>to tell me this isn't humanity?
<SYNC Start=1218823><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1220157 End=1222246><P Class=ZHCC>
Who's to judge what makes<br>somethng human anyway?!
<SYNC Start=1222337 End=1227384><P Class=ZHCC>
Does this make me human?!<br>Or this?! Or these?!
<SYNC Start=1227384><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1230610 End=1233873><P Class=ZHCC>
Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot.
<SYNC Start=1233873><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1234591 End=1237949><P Class=ZHCC>
Maybe we as a society need to<br>realize that artificial intelligence
<SYNC Start=1238074 End=1242265><P Class=ZHCC>
... is intelligence all the same, and<br>we can learn from the robots.
<SYNC Start=1242265><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1243088 End=1245177><P Class=ZHCC>
I think maybe one day we can all-
<SYNC Start=1245177><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1247116 End=1249170><P Class=ZHCC>
Heh- wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?
<SYNC Start=1249170><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1250047 End=1251420><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, robots don't fart!
<SYNC Start=1251420><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1252073 End=1253809><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh... now ending fart sequence.
<SYNC Start=1254075 End=1255588><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, and it, it smells, too!
<SYNC Start=1255789 End=1257033><P Class=ZHCC>
Smell sequence initiated.
<SYNC Start=1257033><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1257540 End=1259042><P Class=ZHCC>
A robot with smelly farts?
<SYNC Start=1259078 End=1260521><P Class=ZHCC>
That doesn't make any sense.
<SYNC Start=1260828 End=1262071><P Class=ZHCC>
Hang on a second here!
<SYNC Start=1262071><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1266871 End=1268866><P Class=ZHCC>
Would you like to touch my body?
<SYNC Start=1268938 End=1270604><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on and touch my body!
<SYNC Start=1270604><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1271532 End=1272306><P Class=ZHCC>
Oooo, my hot body!
<SYNC Start=1272561 End=1274404><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't you like my hot body?
<SYNC Start=1274487 End=1275895><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on and touch my titties!
<SYNC Start=1275895><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1276436 End=1277891><P Class=ZHCC>
I felt them just like ???
<SYNC Start=1278103 End=1280028><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on Justin, touch my body!
<SYNC Start=1280130 End=1281104><P Class=ZHCC>
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
<SYNC Start=1281199 End=1283475><P Class=ZHCC>
Touch my body! You and me!
<SYNC Start=1283660 End=1285455><P Class=ZHCC>
Check it out, my not-hot body!
<SYNC Start=1285455><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Come on, my body!

Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!
