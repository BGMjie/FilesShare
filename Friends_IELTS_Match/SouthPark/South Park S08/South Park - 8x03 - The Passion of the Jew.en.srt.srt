13
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:28,194

00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,952

17
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,811
Captain Cartman reporting
from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity.

18
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,327
Approaching planet Omega Nine.

19
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:46,764
Warp drive disengaged.
Landing sequence initiated.

20
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:48,915
What kind of atmosphere are you
reading on the planet surface, Jew?

21
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:50,825
I'm a Vulcan!

22
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,451
All right, what kind of atmosphere
are you reading, Vulcan Jew?

23
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:57,296
The atmosphere is oxygen-based,
should support our breathing.

24
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:58,578
All right, hang on. We're about to land.

25
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:03,864
Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny,

26
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,021
you come with me on the away team.

27
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,400
Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,751
No! I'm on the away team too!

29
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,491
It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!

30
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:12,635
I don't care! You're not making
me wait in the van again!

31
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:16,591
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there
on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.

32
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:22,489
Set phasers on stun.

33
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,294
Things seem pretty quiet.

34
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:26,344
Yes. A little too quiet.

35
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:29,278
I am picking up carbon-based
life forms in Sector C.

36
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:32,202
I believe we will find a village of peaceful
aliens over that ridge.

37
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,184
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!!

38
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:37,616
Look out!! It's a giant four-headed lava frog!!

39
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:38,446
Shoot it!!

40
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,393
Oh no, it got Kyle!!

41
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:42,937
No it doesn't.

42
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,110
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!!

43
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,718
Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for.

44
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,689
No I'm not! Goddamnit Cartman,
you're not gonna kill me off again!

45
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,190
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews
along on the away team: they don't play along!

46
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,227
Shut up about Jews, fatass!
You don't know anything!

47
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:57,476
Oh God, here we go again.

48
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:59,755
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion,

49
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:02,147
and Mel Gibson says, in the movie,
Jews are the Devil!

50
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,012
He does not!

51
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:03,756
How do you know?!

52
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:06,133
I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle!

53
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,463
You haven't seen it once!

54
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:10,311
There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus,
and you know what they do?

55
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:14,051
They let Barabbas, a serial killer,
go free instead and laugh about it.

56
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,864
- Naw uh!
- Go see the movie, Kyle!!

57
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:18,303
That does it! I'm sick of you guys
arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.

58
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,387
I'm not arguing about The Passion!
He's being an asshole!

59
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:25,057
You know what it is? You're scared.
You're scared of the truth.

60
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,698
You don't want that movie to show
you just how bad the Jews are,

61
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:30,260
- and why everyone hates you.
- People don't hate the Jews!

62
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,225
Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle.

63
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:35,856
The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle.

64
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,462
Those numbers don't lie.

65
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:40,096
If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it.

66
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:41,590
Go see it and tell me I'm wrong.

67
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:45,102
Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.

68
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,710
...You're a stupid asshole!

69
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:55,463
Sweeet, now I can just play with myself.

70
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,897
Get back in the shuttlecraft!

71
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:09,971
One please.

72
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:12,681
This is an R-rated movie.

73
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,369
Yeah, I know, but I have to-

74
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:19,286
But, because this is such an important film that
actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ,

75
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,768
I'll let you in to see it.

76
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:22,864
...Thanks.

77
00:04:16,054 --> 00:04:19,100
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,003
Pretty brutal, isn't it?

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,804
Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?

80
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,565
"And now, back to Terrance and Phillip"

81
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,510
Hey Terrance, I think I have a-

82
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,518
Mom! Doorbell!

83
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,477
Mom! Answer the door!

84
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:38,837
Goddamnit, lazy-ass whore.

85
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,813
You were right... You were right all along...

86
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:49,559
I thought you were just an asshole
when you ripped on Jews, but...

87
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,598
I didn't know, I... I didn't know.

88
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,598
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay.

89
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:58,904
Just... say that first part again?

90
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,064
You were right?

91
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:04,319
Mmm, one more time, Kyle.

92
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:06,364
You were right.

93
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,521
I want to thank you for all
the blessings you have brought me.

94
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,699
You have shown me the way so many times in the past and...

95
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,679
now you are making all my dreams come true.

96
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:18,381
You give me strength when there is doubt,

97
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,192
and I praise you for all you have done.

98
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,632
Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom
and the courage to show the world the truth.

99
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:29,037
From this day forward I will dedicate my life
to making sure your film is seen by everyone.

100
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,807
I will organize the masses so that
we may do thy bidding.

101
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:34,212
Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.

102
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,273
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made
almost 400 milliion dollars at the box office now.

103
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:43,513
Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie.

104
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,639
I guess... we have to ge see it too.

105
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:13,681
Dude. That movie sucked.

106
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:16,670
How can they even call that a movie?

107
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,784
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.

108
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:25,109
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible
Christ's death was.

109
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:28,953
Me neither. Oh honey, let's be
good Christians from now on!

110
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:34,249
I think if more people saw The Passion
they'd have faith in Jesus.

111
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,745
Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing.

112
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,629
Hey, we want our money back.

113
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:42,207
Huh?

114
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,247
That movie sucked ass.
Give us back our eighteen dollars.

115
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:46,895
I can't refund your money.
You sat through the whole movie.

116
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,938
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!

117
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:52,057
You can't charge people to watch
a guy get tortured for two hours!

118
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:56,707
That guy happened to be Jesus,
and he went through all that to pay for YOUR SINS!

119
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,995
We go to church to learn that stuff!

120
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:59,080
We go to movies to be entertained!

121
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,885
We weren't entertained,
and we want our money back!

122
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:03,797
I'm now allowed to give you your money back
after you sat through the whole movie!

123
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,995
You'd have to take your complaint up
with the film's producers.

124
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:10,214
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have
to get our money back from Mel Gibson?

125
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,867
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.

126
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:13,859
Oh, we will! This is America!

127
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:16,316
And in America, if something sucks,
you're supposed to be able to get your money back!

128
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,069
Come on, Kenny!

129
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,208
Kill him! Guilty!

130
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,222
Kill him! Kill him!

131
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,664
Kill Jesus! Yesss!

132
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:58,352
Okay, search for Mel Gibson.

133
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,976
Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news,
Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.

134
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:04,120
Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com,

135
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,579
your source for everything Mel. Pictures,
philosophy, upcoming projects.

136
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,539
Damnit, no phone number!

137
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:10,921
Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson,
call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."

138
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:11,567
Okay, okay, wait, here we go.

139
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,431
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.

140
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:23,741
Hi, uh, my friend
and I just went to see The Passion.

141
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:25,569
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now.

142
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,915
Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.

143
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:29,658
Nonono, no, we want our money back

144
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:31,185
What?

145
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,590
We think the movie sucked and we want
Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars.

146
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,918
Do you know how we can get in touch with him?

147
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:36,115
You thought it sucked?

148
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,443
Sir, apparently, you don't understand
what Mel Gibson was trying to do!

149
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:40,314
He was trying to express, through cinema,

150
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,332
the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.

151
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,215
It has made people the world over open their eyes.

152
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,145
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie,

153
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,226
so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson
so we can get our money back!

154
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:49,584
If I knew where Mel Gibson was,

155
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:51,940
I'd be down on the floor licking his balls
at this very moment, sir.

156
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,117
All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu.

157
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,285
Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time,
you little wussy prick.

158
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:59,432
Hey, don't take that tone with me,
kid! I'll kick your ass!

159
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,709
Ohoh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole!
I'm like six feet tall!

160
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,429
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!

161
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,969
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch!
I'll pop your fuckin' head open!

162
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:08,378
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!

163
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:09,501
I already brought it, bitch!

164
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:11,930
I brought it, set it down on the table
and opened it, bitch!

165
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,372
Wait a minute. Cartman?!

166
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,877
Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!

167
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:22,991
We'll take the bus!

168
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:25,296
Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars
ticket money anymore.

169
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,692
This is about being able to hold
bad filmmakers responsible!

170
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,745
This is just like when we got our
money  back for BASEketball!

171
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:42,952
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard
saying something about a meeting?

172
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all
the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.

173
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,644
Oh, that's great, sweetie.

174
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:48,823
Tell them I'll be down shortly

175
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:49,610
Okay, hon.

176
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,548
Töten sie die Juden!

177
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:56,594
Wir können nicht stillstehen
bis sie alle tot sind!

178
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,419
Okay, I'm ready.

179
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:02,874
I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson.

180
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:07,328
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?

181
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:08,650
No. Actually, we're guests as well.

182
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,092
I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.

183
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:11,621
Hello.

184
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:15,090
I think it's so great that someone took
the initiative to have a meeting like this.

185
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,337
Oh I agree. There are so many of us
who are moved by The Passion.

186
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:21,866
It's a perfect idea to have us organize
so we can strengthen the Christian community.

187
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:25,406
And apparently the organizer is just an
eight year old boy who was touched by the film.

188
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,420
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?

189
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,478
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love
The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!

190
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:36,524
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how
to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives.

191
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,205
Ah hello everyone. Achtung.

192
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:45,733
My name is Eric Cartman
and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.

193
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,330
Ah thank you, thank you.

194
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,218
I'm happy to see that all of you were
affected by The Passion like I was.

195
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,743
Now, we all know why we're here,

196
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:56,392
and I believe we all what needs to be done.

197
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:57,845
We sure do.

198
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,767
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it

199
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,079
until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.

200
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:07,426
Wha, what does that mean, sweetie?

201
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,491
I'm not sure, but-uh.

202
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:11,656
Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second

203
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:14,983
and say how remarkable it is that this little boy
brought us all together.

204
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:18,425
The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality,

205
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,110
and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks.

206
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,602
Thank you, thank you very much.

207
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,941
Now, in order to do what we all know needs to be done,

208
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:28,876
we are first going to need more support.

209
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:32,249
I think we should all go out and take at least
one other person to see The Passion.

210
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:33,665
Oh, what a great idea!

211
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:36,630
We each make it our responsibility
to convert one more person!

212
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,443
Heheh great! Yeah! Great idea.

213
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:41,966
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing,
if you know what I mean.

214
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,148
We sure do!

215
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah. All right. Woohoo!

216
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,012
Thank you.

217
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,908
This must be the place.

218
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:58,489
Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded.

219
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:05,908
Yes?

220
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:09,020
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny

221
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,156
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion,
and we didn't like it,

222
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,545
so, can we have our money back, please?

223
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,275
You can't not like The Passion!

224
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:18,444
I just followed the Bible!

225
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:20,533
Christ died for you. Go home.

226
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,649
Look, dude, we came a long way.

227
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,126
We're not leaving until you give us our money.

228
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:28,323
Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.

229
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:30,011
But I won't tell you where I keep my money.

230
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,590
You can torture me all you want,
I still won't tell you!

231
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,686
Tor-torture you?

232
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,465
Ha! So you DO intend to torture me, huh?!

233
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,934
Well go ahead!

234
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,283
Do your worst!

235
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,304
You STILL won't get your ticket money back!

236
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:43,192
I can take whatever you can dish out!

237
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,810
We don't want to torture you.

238
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,244
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?!

239
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:50,988
Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't
use those whips over there on the wall!

240
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,890
Dude, can we please just have
the eighteen dollars back from you?

241
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,133
I have to use that money to build my church!

242
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,820
I brought the fire and brimstone back to
Christianity with The Passion

243
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,290
and now I'm gonna start my own church!

244
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,007
And do you know why?!
So I can play banjo!

245
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:07,122
Jesus, oh how I love ya,
how I love ya Jesus!

246
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,025
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!

247
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:11,434
How dare you call me crazy!

248
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:13,221
This means war!

249
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,785
And so it was that God sent his only
son down from heaven, to die for our sins.

250
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:31,239
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die,
or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.

251
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,098
...What is troubling you, my child?

252
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,304
Well, I have this friend, see?

253
00:13:36,304 --> 00:13:39,151
And this friend belongs to a certain,
Chosen People of Israel.

254
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,473
And it ...so happens that these chosen
people killed your Lord.

255
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,709
Ah! You mean he's a Jew!

256
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,965
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore.

257
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:50,426
Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God,
he was still a nice guy.

258
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:52,527
And he didn't deserve what happened
to him in Mel Gibson's movie.

259
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:55,432
I I can't sleep at night. I mean,
my... friend can't sleep at night.

260
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:57,638
Yes, The Passion is very powerful.

261
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:01,034
The truth is, there's not a whole lot
in the Bible about the Crucifixion.

262
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:05,803
The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in
the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.

263
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,280
But how can the Jews make it better??

264
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,108
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul,
then perhaps show him the way of Jesus.

265
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:14,307
Remember: Christianity is about... atonement.

266
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:16,835
Wait. That's it. Atonement.

267
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,409
Of course. I know what I have to do now.
Thank you, Father.

268
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,672
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that
would haul that tanker

269
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:31,443
You wanna get outta here? Talk to me.

270
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:37,324
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!
Wait! There's his wallet!

271
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:40,016
Freedom!!!

272
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:42,279
Awww crap, he's only got twenties!
You got two dollars, Kenny??

273
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,311
Jesus is Lord!!!

274
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:45,956
All right, let's get the hell out of here!

275
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:57,986
When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!

276
00:14:58,846 --> 00:14:59,917
Run, dude, run!

277
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,847
And good evening, friends!

278
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:17,423
One month ago today, this amazing
film opened in theaters.

279
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:21,605
And now, we proud few gathere here as a people
brought together by its message!

280
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:29,386
Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now,
together, we have the power to change the world!

281
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,222
Now I believe we should take to the streets

282
00:15:33,222 --> 00:15:36,031
and march in unwavering support of this important movie!

283
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:38,827
- What a great idea!
- It'll be like a parade!

284
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:39,920
Good idea!

285
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:44,138
And as we march for The Pasion
we should also voice our support!

286
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:48,207
So, when I say
"Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"

287
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:52,069
you all chant back
"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."

288
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,374
Well, what does that mean, dear?

289
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:57,259
Oh, I think it's Aramaic.
You know, like in the movie.

290
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:58,978
Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.

291
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:03,604
What was our Aramaic line again?

292
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,256
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!!

293
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,483
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

294
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,626
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

295
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,903
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

296
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,233
Oh huh, this is fun!

297
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:18,656
All right, everyone!
Forward, march!

298
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:20,618
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

299
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:22,677
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

300
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:27,069
- Es ist Zeit für Rache!
- Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.

301
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,210
Nice.

302
00:16:33,152 --> 00:16:35,591
Shalom hak nak shalom.

303
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:42,608
And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski,
has asked if he could speak to the congragation.

304
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:43,693
Thank you, rabbi.

305
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:51,052
In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology
to the African American community for slavery.

306
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,809
In 1956, Germany officially apologized
for World War II AND the Holocaust.

307
00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:00,424
And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community
needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.

308
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:02,151
What?

309
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:04,513
Whatwhatwhaaat?!

310
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:07,858
If we as a people choose not to believe
that Jesus is the Son of God,

311
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:10,954
then we can still apologize for the
brutal way in which he was killed,

312
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,921
and take our share of the responsibility for it.

313
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:14,078
Oh my God!

314
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:17,982
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!

315
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:21,765
- I saw The Passion.
- Oh no! The Passion?!

316
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:24,563
This proves the anti-Semitic effect
that movie is having!

317
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:27,526
Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.

318
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:30,798
Stereotyping Jews is terrible.

319
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,670
Something must be done to stop that movie!

320
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,769
Now, now, everyone calm down.

321
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:37,704
We live in a rational community,

322
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,191
and everyone knows this is just a movie.

323
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,834
There's no cause for alarm.

324
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,988
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

325
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,317
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

326
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:48,623
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

327
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,135
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

328
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:53,741
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!

329
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,566
Es ist Zeit für Rache!

330
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,695
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty...
seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.

331
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,621
But I think it's the principle
of the thing that matters.

332
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:12,295
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me.

333
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:16,146
Give me back my money!

334
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,969
Goddamn, that guy's crazy.

335
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,057
Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.

336
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:22,607
Huh?

337
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:24,775
Mel Gibson is chasing after us.
You've gotta go faster.

338
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:27,794
Haha, very funny, kid.
Sit down and stop playing games.

339
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right
behind you and he's gonna-

340
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:31,903
What the hell?

341
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,373
- Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
- Yeah. I told you that!

342
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:39,868
Well, what the hell does he want?!

343
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,933
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion,
so we kinda took it.

344
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:46,547
You didn't like The Passion?
But it shows how Christ suffered for you.

345
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,635
Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man.

346
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:55,735
You guys, stop! Please.

347
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,184
You're gonna make people hate us more.

348
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:58,968
Can I help you?

349
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:01,737
This movie is causing anti-Semitism!

350
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:03,348
You must remove it from your theater!

351
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:05,273
That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!

352
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:08,039
Remove it from the theater?
Fat chance!

353
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,384
- We demand you stop showing it!
- Yeah! Yeah!

354
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,094
Nonono! Don't become an angry mob!

355
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:14,747
The last time we did that we killed Jesus!

356
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,967
Juden!

357
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,680
- What's going on here?
- They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.

358
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,365
This film is anti-Semitic
and it must be stopped!

359
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:25,348
Nonsense!
Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man!

360
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,142
There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!

361
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:30,043
It has reaffirmed all
of our faith in Christ.

362
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:34,524
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want
to apologize for the death of Jesus!

363
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:37,831
Well, maybe you should apologize.

364
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:41,357
- That's right! What he said.
- How dare you?!

365
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,236
Look out!!

366
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:57,250
Give me my eighteen dollars!

367
00:19:58,032 --> 00:19:59,520
Mel! Gibson!

368
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:04,088
Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer!
You're actually here!

369
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:07,436
Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses!
We are ready to do thy bidding!

370
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,379
Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!

371
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:13,449
So! You boys have led me here
to your secret base, huh?

372
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:16,787
I guess now you're gonna
start torturing me! Well!

373
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,753
Oh, my nipples are so tender!
Ddon't squeeze them anymore!

374
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,567
That's... Mel Gibson?

375
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:25,876
H-he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.

376
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:30,682
Well. I guess you wanna
torture me now, don't you?!

377
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:32,615
Dude, what's wrong with him?

378
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:35,528
He's kookoo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.

379
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,276
You! You would all love
to torture me, wouldn't you?

380
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:42,669
Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there,
I can take it!

381
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:46,333
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole
time because of THAT guy's movie?

382
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:52,058
Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me,
then just give me my eighteen dollars!

383
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:54,486
It's our eighteen dollars!
Your movie sucked!

384
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:58,377
You can't say my movie sucked,
or else you're saying Christianity sucked!

385
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,533
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool,

386
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,230
but, you should follow what Jesus taught
instead of how he got killed.

387
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,529
Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in
the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.

388
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,854
You know, he's right, Elise.

389
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,616
We shouldn't focus our faith on
the torture and execution of Christ.

390
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:18,718
Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times.

391
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:21,337
We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.

392
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,507
Aw, aw, no, come on, people,
we're so close to completing my final solution!

393
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:28,728
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish

394
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:31,103
now that I see that Mel Gibson
is just a big wacko douche.

395
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:40,885
