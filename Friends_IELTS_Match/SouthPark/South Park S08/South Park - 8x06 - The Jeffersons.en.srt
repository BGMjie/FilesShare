<font color=#00FFFF>South Park Season08 Episode07
The Jeffersons</font>

17
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,335
Hey, check it out, dude.

18
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,746
Somebody bought the Donovans' old house.

19
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,956
Yeah, I think they already moved in.

20
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:44,779
I saw moving vans in their
driveway two days ago.

21
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,680
I hope they're not Austrians.
That's the last thing this town needs.

22
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:48,435
Hey look!

23
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:52,173
Hello.

24
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:55,809
Hey. Do you live here?

25
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:57,669
Yeah, I just moved here with my dad.

26
00:00:57,805 --> 00:00:59,775
Are you gonna be my new friends?

27
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:00,757
No.

28
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:02,893
I really like your town.

29
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,644
My dad wanted to move somewhere
to get away from it all.

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,533
He said he wanted piece and quiet,

31
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:10,317
and to live with a bunch of hicks
who don't know anything.

32
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:12,825
What's that you're wearing?

33
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:17,379
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best
for me to hide my face.

34
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:19,316
My name's Blanket.

35
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:22,850
Your name is Blanket. Right.
Well, Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody,

36
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,722
and these are my friends Timsy, Winky and Nod.

37
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:27,581
Unfortunately, we have to be off to the
Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.

38
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:30,528
Wait, don't you guys wanna
come inside and play?

39
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:32,683
Huh look dude, we're in
the fourth grade, okay?

40
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:35,337
You know what that means? It means
we don't hang out with a little kid.

41
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:37,014
Come on, guys, let's get
back to our Big Wheels.

42
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,424
We have arcade games inside.

43
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:43,374
Dad?

44
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,354
Whoa. Dude, no way.

45
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,138
Oh my God, this is awesome!

46
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:50,669
Dude, are these all your toys?

47
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,731
No, this is all my dad's stuff.
He loves toys and video games.

48
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:57,059
Dude, he must be loaded!
What does he do?

49
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,368
He's retired now.

50
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,576
Oh my God, dude! Your dad must
be the coolest dad in the world!

51
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,198
Come on, my dad's probably
out in the back yard.

52
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:08,313
Oh, kick ass!

53
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:10,307
Dude, why isn't my house like this?!

54
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:11,898
Dad, you out here??

55
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,746
Here I am, Blanket!

56
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:27,425
Blanket!! Oh my beautiful blanket!

57
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:28,670
What's wrong with his face?

58
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,854
Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's
a burn victim or something.

59
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,287
Guys, this is my dad,

60
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,473
Michael Ja-
Jefferson!

61
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:34,906
Michael... Jefferson, yeh.

62
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,690
Hey, you wanna play with me?

63
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,144
Come on, let's climb the tree!

64
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,711
Come on, climb the tree,
climb the tree!

65
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:49,732
Have you been up my...
Wishing Tree? Tuh!

66
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,019
It's where I come to think and dream.

67
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:57,164
And now I'd like to show you my
... Wishing Tree. Jam on!

68
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,510
Where we can laugh and giggle
and scream. Hee hee!

69
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,847
- Imagination is the key.
- Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.

70
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,726
Won't you imagine along with me?

71
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:06,196
Mr. Jefferson?

72
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:11,304
We can be spacemen, or pirates
on the sea Chuckajam on

73
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:17,890
Yes we can do everything, and
I mean, everything! Chuckajam on

74
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:24,012
Up in my Wishing Tree! Hee hee!
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

75
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:28,819
Hey you guys! You guys!

76
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,499
You gotta come with us
over to the Jeffersons!

77
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:31,753
The Jeffersons?

78
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:33,256
They're a new family that
just moved to South Park!

79
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:36,421
We met this kid named Blanket, and
he has the coolest dad in the world!

80
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,697
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids
in town to go play over at their house.

81
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:42,127
They have like, video games and
rides and a cotton-candy machine

82
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:44,311
oh, and, and in their back yard,
guess what they have in their back yard??

83
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:46,108
Guess. A train.

84
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:47,775
No way.

85
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:49,043
Yeah way, Craig!

86
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:51,392
And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson,
then you can just not come!

87
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:53,681
I believe in Mr. Jefferson.

88
00:03:57,351 --> 00:04:00,979
Weeeeeee, look at us on the swing!
We're swinging!

89
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,963
Who wants the first cotton candy?

90
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:05,080
Memememememememememe...

91
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,170
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!

92
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:10,692
Ooooh, let's go ride the choo-choo train!

93
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,517
Choo-choo train! Yay!

94
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:18,571
Let's ride the train! The train!

95
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:21,495
Would you like to ride the train with me,

96
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:24,548
and start a magical journey?

97
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:27,751
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson.

98
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,063
You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.

99
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,953
Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.

100
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,278
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.

101
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:39,002
Let's ride and ride on the train together

102
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:40,599
...Train together

103
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:42,272
On a journey through both of our minds.

104
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,163
...I've got time. Do youuu??

105
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:46,666
Dude, what happened to your knee?

106
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,497
I fell down.

107
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:50,200
Mr. Jefferson!

108
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:54,085
Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.

109
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:56,081
Choo-choo train.

110
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,732
Mr.! Goddamnit. Here, come on.
We need to clean that up.

111
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,049
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.

112
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:04,702
- Ow!
- I know, I know. Be cool.

113
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:07,649
Thank you. That already feels better.

114
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:10,892
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?

115
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,288
I have a half-brother and a half-sister.

116
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,424
But they live with their mom now.

117
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:16,762
And where is your mom?

118
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,394
I don't have a mom.

119
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:19,733
You must have a mom.

120
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:21,670
You mean she doesn't live here,
or she's dead, or what?

121
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:24,347
No. I was made in a laboratory.

122
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,087
What?

123
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:28,733
My daddy wanted to have a baby,
so he put me in a test tube.

124
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,857
Then, they put me in a woman's tummy,
and, when I was born,

125
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,196
daddy took me home.

126
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,239
So you never met your mom?

127
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,363
Noo...

128
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:42,619
But I used to have a lot of bodyguards
and nannies, if that counts.

129
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,498
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.

130
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,166
Oh man, that was great!

131
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:48,540
You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said?

132
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,043
He said I'm his best friend,

133
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:51,863
and I can go over to his house
whenever I want!

134
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:53,877
I'm supposed to go right back
over there after dinner tonight!

135
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,508
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.

136
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:57,802
You feel bad for him?!

137
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,313
He has everything a kid could want!

138
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:02,415
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants
to be a kid, not have one.

139
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,340
Oh, you know what?!
This makes perfect sense!

140
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:07,219
A guy moves into South Park with
a FERRIS wheel in his back yard,

141
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:08,769
and KYLE has to see a problem with it!

142
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:11,505
Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's
happened to this town in a long time,

143
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:13,702
and if you miss this up,
so help me GOD,

144
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,475
I will rip your balls off
with my bare hands!

145
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,424
With my bare hands, Goddamn you!

146
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:25,091
Well, there he is.
Where have you been all afternoon.

147
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:26,853
I was over at the new neighbors,
the Jeffersons.

148
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,487
Oh, are they nice people?

149
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,095
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.

150
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,549
Well, we're supposed to have
the Broflovskis and the Stotches

151
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:33,606
over for dinner tonight.

152
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:35,543
Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.

153
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:42,329
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say
you moved here from Kentucky?

154
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:43,644
Kentucky, yeh.

155
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,052
I heard people saying you
all were from Illinois.

156
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,852
No, theh, they're ignorant.
That's ignorant.

157
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:51,482
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?

158
00:06:51,868 --> 00:06:55,038
Oh I'm retired now, but,
I was in... pharmaceuticals.

159
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,881
Well our boys have really
taken a liking to you.

160
00:06:57,928 --> 00:06:59,536
You seem to really have a way with them.

161
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,838
I just id- identify so much
with children.

162
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:03,390
Their innocence, their beauty.

163
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,797
I think that God is in
the face of every child.

164
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:09,121
...Yeeeah.

165
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,762
...They are fun.

166
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:14,982
Boys, you okay out there?

167
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:15,851
Fine Mom.

168
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:17,377
Wow, these are great.

169
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:18,739
What are they called again?

170
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:20,072
They're TV dinners.

171
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,751
Don't you wanna take that
veil off so you can eat?

172
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,571
Nah, I'm not supposed to.

173
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,896
Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.

174
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:31,472
What the hell is going on?!

175
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,893
Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!

176
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:33,973
No, my parents are.

177
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,087
You guys better not be trying
to Bogart my friend away!

178
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:36,568
What?

179
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:37,870
He is MY friend, got it?!

180
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:40,265
I was friends with him before
you assholes were,and I hoowi-

181
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:42,261
Stan! Stan, I'm serisouslih!

182
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:44,750
You'd better not be talking bad
about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!

183
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,466
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant
was up in Eagle today.

184
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:49,544
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson?

185
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:50,918
Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?

186
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,722
I think he's definitely going to jail.

187
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:56,129
I just love seeing smug celebrities
get their comeuppance.

188
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,457
think it's wrong what the police
do to wealthy black men.

189
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:02,111
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're
not one of those who think

190
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:05,305
that the police go around framing rich
black people just because they're jealous..

191
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:08,188
Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and

192
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,867
they have... doodoo in their soul.

193
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:16,245
Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.

194
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,466
Whatcha got?

195
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:19,556
Looks like a new family has just
moved into South Park.

196
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,586
One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought
a house there and paid cash.

197
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:25,255
He seems to have a lot of money.

198
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:26,394
So, what's the problem?

199
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:27,897
Take a look. Says here...

200
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:29,060
He's black.

201
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,899
By God, so he is. Black and rich.

202
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:36,255
Time to take this Mr. Jefferson
down, just like we did Kobe.

203
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,698
Let's go people!
We've got another rich black guy.

204
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,257
I want him humiliated and dragged through
the dirt, and I want it done by the books!

205
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:50,930
Kyle?

206
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,760
Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'?

207
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,204
Mr. Jefferson- Awww!

208
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,802
It's 1:30 in the morning!

209
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,019
Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.
T- shamon!

210
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:03,113
I'm a little boy forever. Hey!

211
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,595
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!

212
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,909
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it!

213
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,447
What the hell are you doing, Stan?!

214
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,504
I'll tell you what you're doing!

215
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:11,971
You're trying to steal MY best friend!

216
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,167
He just showed up here.

217
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,926
Remember, Mr. Jefferson?
You said we were best friends.

218
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:17,817
Jesus Christ!

219
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,627
Dude, look who I found prowling
around in my back yard.

220
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,613
Hi Stan.

221
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,627
He was out all alone in the middle of the night.

222
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,071
Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.

223
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,420
- I know. He's here.
- What??

224
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,588
Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay,
it's a slumber party!

225
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,055
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need
to take your son home.

226
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,239
We can't go home.
There's a ghost in our house.

227
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,718
Me and Blanket are scared.

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,679
Dad says it wants to eat us.

229
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:41,435
Please don't make us go back home.

230
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,583
Please! We're scared, we're scared!

231
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,511
We're scared!

232
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,380
Hee hee!

233
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,630
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here,
but we're going to sleep now!

234
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:49,733
Come on, Blanket.

235
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:57,435
Now let's all sleep and dream Heehee!

236
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:00,507
of fun and adventurous things shamon!

237
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,663
It's time for us all to say goodnight

238
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,753
Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could
be around you all the time.

239
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,090
You're awesome.

240
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,851
I think you're awesome too, Cartman.

241
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:17,640
Yeah?

242
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,344
Yeah.

243
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:19,725
Yeah?

244
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:20,599
Yeah.

245
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:21,669
Yeah?

246
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:24,431
Haaa!

247
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,573
What's the matter, Stan?
Did you have a bad dream?

248
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,321
Yeah. A really bad dream. Oh Jesus!

249
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,971
Murphy, you inside?

250
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,134
We're inside, sir.

251
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:44,444
Harris was right. This guy looks like
he has more money than all of us put together.

252
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,200
Black sonofabitch!

253
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:48,743
I'm planting the cocaine now.

254
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,506
Johnson, what about you?

255
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:52,503
Placing the blood spatter now, sir.

256
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:53,986
Frakes?

257
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,389
Placing pubic hair from
the raped girl now, sir.

258
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,418
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up,

259
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:00,085
arrest him fast and try not to beat him.

260
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:02,049
There could be neighbors with video cameras.

261
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:06,262
Why do we do it, Harris?

262
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,319
Sir?

263
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,145
Why is it that us policement around
the country have such a passion...

264
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:13,865
for framing wealthy African-Americans
with crimes they didn't commit?

265
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:17,858
Oh why? I guess I never thought
about why, sir. We just do it.

266
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:20,158
Twenty-five years I've been on the force.

267
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,767
I've seen every kind of sick,
depraved act known to humanity...

268
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:26,925
and still, when I see a black man walk
by who has more money than me, I...

269
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,768
want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter.

270
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:33,475
But why? Maybe there is no reason.

271
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,434
Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there
that's mostly covered with water...

272
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,561
and we're just goin' along for the ride.

273
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,664
Stan, time to get up for school.

274
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:48,058
Stan? What the-?

275
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:50,355
Mr. Jefferson?!

276
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,753
Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party.

277
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,482
Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!

278
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,073
Inappropriate?
No, you're being ignorant.

279
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,457
They're my friends.

280
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:03,448
You see, I I didn't have a childhood,
so I'm really just a child myself.

281
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:06,707
Here, everything's okay.
I want you each to have a hundred dollars.

282
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:10,506
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that
new sport coat I've been wanting.

283
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,507
Come on, Blanket.
We have to go home and feed the animals.

284
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:15,450
Bye, friends.

285
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,763
Boys, I do not want you going over
to Mr. Jefferson's anymore.

286
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:20,818
Do you understand?

287
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,140
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom.
That guy's a freak!

288
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,907
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore?

289
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:29,539
Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh,
but you can suck my fat hairy balls!

290
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:34,731
Come on, Blanket!

291
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,512
Hey Harris Harris Harris! Harris!

292
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:40,568
What what what?

293
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,234
It's Jefferson! He's back!

294
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,221
All right, people.

295
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,524
Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.

296
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:51,957
Whoa, wait a minute!
That guy isn't black!

297
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,652
Holy God, his son isn't
black either! Oh Jesus!

298
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,026
This is Yeats! Stand down!

299
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,991
I repeat, stand down!
Suspect is not black!

300
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,695
You son of a bitch, you told my
this guy was African-American!

301
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,731
It says right here on
the final sheet he is!

302
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,021
Does that look like a black guy to you?!

303
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,876
It said on the final sheet!

304
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,701
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs!

305
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:15,752
We could have made an innocent man
go to jail who wasn't black!

306
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:16,797
Oh!

307
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,902
Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming?

308
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,946
We're supposed to...protect the people.

309
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:29,615
Where have we lost our way?

310
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:32,817
Sir, it's possible that he is black,
even though he doesn't look it.

311
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,397
To hell with you!!

312
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,648
I'm never gonna frame
an innocent man again!

313
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,949
Unless I KNOW he's black for sure!!

314
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,403
All the adults are trying to get us.

315
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,936
Get up to your room, Blanket,
and put your mask on!

316
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:45,758
We can't go outside anymore!

317
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,647
That poor kid.

318
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:01,502
Dude, come on. We're not
supposed to go over there.

319
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:05,103
Hi guys!

320
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:06,372
Hey Blanket.

321
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:10,097
Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my
dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?

322
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:11,926
Really? You mean it?

323
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:14,262
Oh yay, my friends are here!

324
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:16,055
Come inside and play, guys!

325
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,862
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing
if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us

326
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:22,370
Chop wood? No, that's ignorant.

327
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,040
That's poopie work.
Blanket and me wanna play!

328
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,713
Mr. Jefferson, ih it might be good
for Blanket to learn how to chop wood

329
00:14:28,713 --> 00:14:31,188
Blanket likes to play,
don't you Blanket?

330
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,879
Wee, look! He can fly!

331
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,962
Jesus Christ, dude!

332
00:14:34,962 --> 00:14:36,285
Aaaaaah!!

333
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:37,998
Stop, you fucking lunatic!!

334
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:44,143
Dude, we have got to get
that kid away from him!

335
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,340
No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying.

336
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,829
It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.

337
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:54,342
Jeekabee durtah! Ow!

338
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,074
There, Blanket, shhhh.

339
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:59,315
Hey, hey look, hey look.
I got your nose.

340
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,768
Look! Blanket, I got your nose.

341
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,463
I got your nose, Blanket. See?

342
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:06,200
I got your nose.

343
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,679
Aaaaaaaa!

344
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,825
No, Blanket, stop!

345
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:22,073
It's ignorant.
You're being ignorant!

346
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,737
Harrison, why haven't you called?
You know how I worry.

347
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,166
I'm givin' up, Maggie.

348
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,533
I'm quitting the force.

349
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,853
Quitting the force? You?

350
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,596
None of it makes sense anymore.

351
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:37,368
I don't even know if what
we're doing is right.

352
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:40,258
The last thirteen hours we've
been working on a case,

353
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:42,481
trying to get a real scumbag off the streets.

354
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:46,823
And when he walked up to the door,
I could have sworn he was white.

355
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,784
Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore.

356
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,419
Maybe it doesn't matter.

357
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,422
Because it seems like every time
we frame a rich black guy,

358
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,548
he's back out on the streets in no time.

359
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:57,414
It's just like OJ.

360
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,098
Do you know how hard those
cops worked to frame him?

361
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:02,191
The tireless hours they put in??

362
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:04,459
And then he just gets off
because somebody messed up

363
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,142
and said the N word out
loud too many times.

364
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:09,529
I guess I'm just tired.

365
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,508
I'm jast damn tired.

366
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:14,096
Not another word of that
kind of talk, Harrison Yeats.

367
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:17,253
Believe me I would love nothin' more
than to have you quit the force

368
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:19,455
and no longer have to worry about
whether or not you're comin' home.

369
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:21,194
But I know you.

370
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:23,902
Framin' rich black men for crimes they
didn't commit is in your blood.

371
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:28,851
Wipin' that rich, smug smile off their faces
is the only thing that puts a smile on yours.

372
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,188
You're a good cop, Harrsion Yeats.

373
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:32,677
You don't have to question that.

374
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,124
Because I'm here to tell you.

375
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,786
And you're a good wife, Maggie.

376
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,859
You know me better than I know myself.

377
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,681
Where're you goin'?

378
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:42,770
Think I've got a little more work to do.

379
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:53,017
Mr. Jefferson?

380
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:55,621
It's your best friend in the whole
wide world, Eric Cartman.

381
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,049
Mr. Jefferson?

382
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,896
I came to sleep over tonight, remember?

383
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:02,693
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you,
you have to fly out here right now!

384
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:04,266
My nose came off again!

385
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:08,113
I know you live in California;
I'll pay for your plane ticket!

386
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:10,294
But I'm falling apart!

387
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:12,306
I need some more of that cream and the injections!

388
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:13,634
I have to look young again!

389
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:16,790
Oh, I'm melting!

390
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,700
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.

391
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,778
Yeah, sure, whatever.

392
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,393
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until
we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.

393
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:24,847
Aren't I too big to be Blanket?

394
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:27,562
I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough
attention to his son to notice.Come on!

395
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:33,580
Blanket, you in here?

396
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,080
Hi guys!

397
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,521
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you
away for a little while, okay?

398
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:40,818
You are? Oh thank you thank you thank you!

399
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:41,976
All right dude, get in his bed.

400
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,651
All right, but you guys owe me for this.

401
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:45,488
Dude, whatever. At least you finally
get to do something.

402
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,175
Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.

403
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:54,184
Hello, this is Sergeant Yeats over at the
Park County Police Department in Colorado.

404
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:56,206
Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?

405
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:59,355
Well, we've been trying to frame
this guy who just moved into our town

406
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,619
and the fil-o-fax says he moved from yoru area.

407
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,260
One Martin Jefferson?

408
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,100
Hm. No, we never had a any rich
African-Americans named Jefferson here.

409
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,918
If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.

410
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,777
Well, he doesn't really look that black.

411
00:18:11,777 --> 00:18:12,902
Yeah, I don't uh...

412
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:13,899
Hold on a second.

413
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,294
There was oine we framed a couple of times,

414
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:20,003
but the black bastard was so rich he made bail
and disappeared before the trial.

415
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,665
You say he disappeared?

416
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:22,828
What did you frame him for?

417
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:25,830
We uhhh found some kids that
had stayed over at his place,

418
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,326
and we asked them to lie and make
up some false molestation charges.

419
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:29,664
Molestation, nice.

420
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:31,488
Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years,

421
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:33,163
but we were finally able to arrest him.

422
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:36,018
Then we planted some evidence,
took embarassing photos of his penis,

423
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:38,514
and threw him in a dirty prison cell
with doodie feces on the walls.

424
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:40,414
You should have seen him squirm!

425
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:42,988
That's damn fine police work, sergeant.
Damn fine.

426
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,412
Heh yeah, but the point is this
guy didn't really look black either.

427
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:49,903
We had to sneak in while he was
asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.

428
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:53,438
Jesus Christ Monkeyballs!
It must be the same guy!

429
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:56,839
Mr. Jefferson, hello??

430
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,443
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go
before your dad sees us.

431
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:03,244
What are you doing with my Blanket?

432
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,281
Come on, Blanket, play with me.

433
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:13,462
Jeechabee durtah! Hee!

434
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:15,385
HAAAAA!
Go go RUUN!

435
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,540
HAAAAA!

436
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,096
Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!

437
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:24,514
Oh Jesus! What the hell
is going on, you guys?

438
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:27,971
My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket!

439
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:29,492
Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!

440
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,756
Wee, he can fly! He can fly!

441
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:33,369
Aaaah, stop!

442
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,591
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

443
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:38,731
You bastard!

444
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:42,516
Blanket? Blanket! Come play!

445
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,052
- Nooo!
- Come on!

446
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,867
Run Blanket Run!

447
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:51,330
Get up, Blanket!

448
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:56,470
Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up!

449
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,064
You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!

450
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:03,089
No! I am sick and tired of
people harassing Mr. Jefferson!

451
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:06,519
All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson
moved here are sick lies!

452
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,583
That he molests children, that he's a
bad father, that he has plastic surgery!

453
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,876
It's ignorant.

454
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:15,543
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's
a little different.

455
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:17,636
But that's because he had to work
all the time when he was young...

456
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,022
and missed out on his childhood.

457
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:21,760
What's wrong with wanting to have
the innocence and beauty of a child.

458
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,506
All right,

459
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:27,644
let's just say all the bad things
said about Mr. Jefferson are lies!

460
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,426
Let's say the police department does
just go around spending their time

461
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,015
framing people for crimes they didn't commit!

462
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:34,939
Let's say it's all made up,and
Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy

463
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:37,278
who's trying to be a child because
he never got to have a childhood.

464
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,736
Well that's fine, except for that
he HAS children now!

465
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:42,316
And when people have children,
they have to grow up!

466
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,747
You're right.

467
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:48,838
I've been so obsessed with my childhood
that I've forgotten about his.

468
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,879
I thought having lots of rides
and toys was enough, but...

469
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,610
Blanket doesn't need a playmate.

470
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,067
He needs a father, and a normal life.
Chickuckoo gainuh.

471
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,840
Blanket, I wanna give away all my money.

472
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,531
I I wanna get a normal job and...

473
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:04,601
take a shot at raising you in a normal setting.

474
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:10,840
Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.

475
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,093
Well, if you're gonna give away
all your money, then,

476
00:21:13,093 --> 00:21:15,690
I guess we can drop all those charges.

477
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,637
No point in putting another
poor black man in jail.

478
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:21,004
All right! Things just might work out!

479
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:22,428
Things can always work out,

480
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:25,059
as long as we know we have
the power to change.

481
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:29,523
We all have the power to change

482
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,150
if we search inside our hearts

483
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,079
And we start to heal the wounds
of all our yesterdays

484
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,928
And you know it might be hard,

485
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:42,349
but all you've got to do is start,

486
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:47,088
And you can change all of
your evil molesting ways.

487
