Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall.

20
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,913
Who's Paris Hilton?

21
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:45,065
"Who's Paris Hilton?"

22
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:46,064
You don't know?

23
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:47,703
Hello,everyone!

24
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:52,004
The Guess Clothing Company is pleased
to have as its new spokesperson model,

25
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:55,544
a woman all you young ones can
look up to...Ms. Paris Hilton.

26
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:02,372
Wow,that's really her!

27
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:03,471
Paris! Over here!

28
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,906
I don't get it. What does she do?

29
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:06,437
She's super-rich!

30
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:08,270
...but what does she do?

31
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,295
She's totally spoiled and snobby.

32
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:12,071
What does she do?!

33
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,665
She's a whore.

34
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:16,935
Hey everyone.
Sorry if I'm a little spent.

35
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:20,457
I did a whole lot of partying last night
with a LOT of different guys.

36
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:28,024
Anyway,I'm pleased to be here in Douth Dark
to announce the opening of my brand new store!

37
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:31,731
A store where girls can buy everything
they need to be just like me!

38
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,420
Stupid Spoiled Whore!

39
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:40,461
Have fun,girls.And remember to party,
and be super-lame to everybody.

40
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,563
Bye!

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,480
Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink!

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,720
Where's my dog?!

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,664
Wow,look at all this great stuff.

44
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:57,803
Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes,
Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls,

45
00:01:57,803 --> 00:01:58,723
Hey,check it out:

46
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:00,813
the new Paris Hilton
perfume, Skanque.

47
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,991
Oh yeah,let's get lots of that!

48
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,570
You guys,don't buy this stuff.

49
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,064
Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?

50
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:10,637
It's not just Paris: Britney Spears,
Christina Aguilera,Tara Reid...

51
00:02:10,637 --> 00:02:12,247
they're all stupid spoiled whores!

52
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:15,437
But the idea that we'll be whorish
for money is belittling to our gender!

53
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:16,725
Wendy,get a clue.

54
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:19,301
The only thing more important
than being rich is being famous!

55
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,480
Wow,you really sound like a dumb slut,Bebe.

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,640
Thanks,Annie!

57
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:27,555
God,get me out of this hick town!
What a bunch of rednecks!

58
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,261
Everybody's so fucking lame.

59
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:32,949
Except for you,my little Tinkerbell.

60
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:36,087
You love my vewy much,don't you?
How much you wuv me?

61
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:38,125
I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny,

62
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,566
and then I'm gonna dress you
up like a little princess.

63
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,242
You're mine forever!

64
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,667
Whatever! Oh,hey,KC.

65
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:49,420
Oh,another stupid store opening
at some lame cowboy town.

66
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,560
Oh,it's so fucking stupid,
this whole town stinks like cows.

67
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,151
I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!

68
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,008
They have the lamest stores,too...

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,860
I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend,I think.

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,944
I dunno,Rome or Tokyo,
either way it'll be totally boring.

71
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:02,878
Stupid.

72
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,855
I need to get wasted.I haven't had
a drink in like fourteen minutes.

73
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,518
Why is everybody so stupid anyway?

74
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,766
I flashed all these hicks with my boobs;
you should've seen the look on their faces!

75
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,343
Stupid redneck idiots!

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:20,800
Oh dear...

77
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,520
Another dog killed itself!

78
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,602
Hey Jessie,hey Kal. Do you guys
mind if I hang out with you?

79
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:30,448
The other girls are acting really strange.

80
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:32,815
Sure,Wendy. We were just trying
to think of something to do.

81
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:35,426
Oh,well,you wanna maybe
go to the art museum?

82
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,135
Nah,that sounds really dull.

83
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:40,579
Hey,I know! Let's make a videotape
of us having sex with boys!

84
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,578
What??

85
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:44,930
I just got "the Stupid Spoiled
Whore video playset"!

86
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:48,308
*Stupid Spoiled Whore
video playset!*

87
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,162
We can make videos that
get out on the Internet!

88
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,184
Yeah!

89
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:54,887
*Stupid Spoiled Whore
video playset!*

90
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,659
*Show the whole world
what a slut you are!*

91
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,534
Stupid Spoiled Whore
Video Playset...

92
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,613
comes with video camera,
night-vision filter,

93
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:05,383
play money,losable cellphone,
and sixteen hits of exstacy.

94
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:08,276
*Stupid Spoiled Whore
Video Playset!*

95
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:11,535
*Let everyone see your
coo-oo-ooch!*

96
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:13,674
I'm pretending to be calling
my friends on the cellphone...

97
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,555
while my man waits for more sex!

98
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:18,682
You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore.

99
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:20,686
Where are you goin',Wendy?

100
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,882
All right,Ms. Hilton...
we'll find you another dog.

101
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,710
There there now, let's just
get you back home,shall we?

102
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:40,289
Wait! Wait,stop the car!

103
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:43,105
Stop the car,you fucking moron!

104
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:45,549
Look at how cuuute.

105
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,932
I want that! I want that!

106
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:52,022
Lu lu lu,I've got some apples,
Lu lu lu,you've got some too.

107
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,752
It's adorable!

108
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,359
Lu lu lu,let's make some applesauce,
take off our clothes and lu lu lu!

109
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,254
Look at his Iwittle puff ball!

110
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:03,769
I'm gonna feed you,and take care
of you, and call you Mr. Biggles!

111
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,248
My name's Butters.

112
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:08,998
Driver,put Mr. Biggles in the car.
I want to find a bear costume for him.

113
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:11,199
Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?

114
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,804
Paris,I believe this is somebody's child.

115
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:14,894
I want it!

116
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,291
I don't think you can actually-

117
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,517
I WANT IT! WANT IT!!!

118
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,633
All right,all right, come on-
come on,young man.

119
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,845
Wa-I'm,Wa-I'm sorry,ma'am.

120
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:23,496
I'd like to be your boyfriend and all,

121
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:25,252
even though you have kind of a big nose,

122
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:28,703
but my parents told me,
"never get into a car with a stranger. "

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,301
Well did they say anything about limosines?

124
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,387
Butters,never get into a car with a stranger!

125
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,028
Unless it's a limosine.

126
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:39,328
Oh. Yeah,actually, they did say
that'd be all right.

127
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:43,573
Get in the limo,Mr. Biggles! We're gonna
have a bear costume made for you!

128
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,937
And now,back to The Price is Right!

129
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:50,038
Hi,sweetie.

130
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,056
What's the matter.

131
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:57,110
Mom,Dad... I'm growing concerned about the
role models young women have in today's society.

132
00:05:57,726 --> 00:05:58,870
Oh?

133
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,489
It seems that lewdness and
shallowness are being exalted,

134
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:03,661
while intellectualism is looked down upon.

135
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,475
Gosh.

136
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:09,801
I think young women are being marketed
to by corrupt,moral-less corporations.

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,350
Well,we'll get right on fixing that,sweetie.

138
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,136
Wanna watch The Price is Right?

139
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,540
Dad,there's a new store at the mall
called "Stupid Spoiled Whore"

140
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,366
and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!

141
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:26,519
What?! No daughter of mine
is going to dress like a whore!

142
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,001
We're marching down to that
store right now,young lady!

143
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,507
Oh my God! Well this place is-!

144
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:35,736
Oh my God!

145
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:39,177
Mrs.Polk,you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!

146
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:40,841
It's what's in right now.

147
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:43,214
I,I can't have my little girl be
the only one not in a trend;

148
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:44,676
she'll be unpopular.

149
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,202
Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?!

150
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:49,150
But these are our girls!

151
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,971
I think it's empowering for them.

152
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:53,970
I mean,sure,if a man wants
to be a whore,it's "normal,"

153
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,602
but if a woman wants to be one, it's "wrong. "

154
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,567
Well,when a man pees standing up, it's "normal,"

155
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,272
but when a woman does it, it's "weeeird. "

156
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,340
Yeah! Right!

157
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,354
Yeah,like,when men shave their balls it's fine,

158
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:12,635
but when a woman does it she's "straaange. "

159
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:15,016
- Yeah! Right! - It isn't fair!

160
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,877
All the girls in South Park are gonna
be total sluts from now on,

161
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:19,424
so you can just get used to it.

162
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:21,816
Yeah. Will you buy me that purse
I want over there?

163
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,921
I'll do anything,'cause I'm a whore.

164
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,060
Oh,uh uh sure I,I can buy a purse.

165
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,878
Dad!!

166
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:28,520
Nope. Wendy,I think they're right.

167
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,603
You see,you have to believe in
the rights of women.

168
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:33,754
For too long they've had to
live a double standard.

169
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:34,800
Oh yeah.

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,067
I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic,Wendy.

171
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,062
From now on you can have whatever
you want from this store,

172
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:42,438
I'll help make you the stupidest,
most spoiled whore of them all!

173
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:43,721
Hooray!

174
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:49,618
Butters,will you mind telling us why
you're dressed up like a bear?!

175
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:55,555
Oh,well,uh,my sort-of-girlfriend
dressed me up like this.

176
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:56,815
Your girlfriend?

177
00:07:56,815 --> 00:08:00,083
There you are,Mr. Biggles!
Aw I thought I'd lost you!

178
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,776
Promise you'll never leave me.

179
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,795
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton?

180
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:07,517
You are grounded,mister!

181
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:13,202
Uh,sweetheart,isn't Paris Hilton
worth a lot of money?

183
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,372
Chris,she's more than twice Butters' age!

184
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,561
Yes,and more than three billion
times his net worth.

185
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:20,249
Everybody adores that girl,darling.
We should be nice to her too,

186
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,020
especially if she's in love with our son!

187
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:25,530
Uhm,Paris,would you like to
have some cocoa with us?

188
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:30,686
With schnapps and Scotch.

189
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:36,865
So,Paris,I understand you're from
the prestigious Hilton family.

190
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,144
Very nice hotels.

191
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,769
I've gotta get outta here.
This place is stupid.

192
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:41,852
Where am I?

193
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,900
Oh,I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.

194
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,610
With you where?

195
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,862
To live with me forever and ever,
you dumb broad.How much?

196
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,346
How much? For Butters?

197
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:54,661
Butters is our son.
He's not for sale.

198
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,059
I'll give you 200 million dollars for it.

199
00:08:58,129 --> 00:08:59,362
Escuse me?!

200
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:02,847
I said I'll give you 200 million dollars for it!

201
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,596
I'll write you a check for
Mr. Biggles right now.

202
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:11,111
Chris,is she serious?

203
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:13,879
Ah,Butters,why don't you take Paris
up to your room for a little while,

204
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,483
Mommy and Daddy have to talk.

205
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,889
Mom,Dad,I I love you. Please
don't sell me to Paris Hilton.

206
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:20,416
Butters,right now!!

207
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:23,677
We aren't honestly considering this?

208
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:26,888
Darling,Paris is a billionaire.
She can give Butters everything he wants.

209
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:29,056
We'd be terrible parents NOT to consider it.

210
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:30,465
But he's our son!

211
00:09:30,465 --> 00:09:31,916
I know,darling,but look...

212
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,568
we have to think about the rest of the family.

213
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,235
The rest of the f- you do mean us?

214
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,328
Yes,us,the rest of the family.

215
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,577
What should we do,Mr. Biggles?
I drank too much.

216
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:46,045
Oh my God,I'm so wasted!

217
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,237
The room's all spinny.

218
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:51,583
I'm... totally passing out.

219
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:08,448
Hey Bebe! I heard you were
having a party tonight.

220
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,352
You wouldn't be interested,Wendy.

221
00:10:10,352 --> 00:10:12,862
My parents are out of town,
so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.

222
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,601
I'm a stupid spoiled whore.

223
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,593
Right. Please,Wendy,you're like
Class President and stuff!

224
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:20,946
Yeah,and you get straight A's in school!

225
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,723
You're not even spoiled,because
your parents give money to charity!

226
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,354
You don't want to go to this party,Wendy!

227
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:27,552
We're inviting all the boys,
and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle,

228
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,583
and Two Minutes In The Closet,
and do ketamine.

229
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:30,833
That's okay.

230
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,983
Oh,please,do you even know what ketsmine is?

231
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:34,004
Yes.

232
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:35,766
See? You are too smart.

233
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,935
Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.

234
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:40,709
Sorry Wendy. You're just
not a whore. Get lost!

235
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:41,587
Yeah.

236
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,137
Hey,we'd better start
invitng boys to the party.

237
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:48,039
Oooo look,here comes Clyde.

238
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,681
Party at my house tonight,Clyde.

239
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:50,804
You're invited.

240
00:10:50,804 --> 00:10:52,778
Mmm,I'd like a piece of that!

241
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:53,777
I wanna do him.

242
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,422
Oh,yeah. Here comes Kyle.

243
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,168
Mmm,talk to me,kosher boy.

244
00:10:57,168 --> 00:10:59,414
I'd like to swivel his pixie stick.

245
00:10:59,414 --> 00:11:01,194
Party at my house tonight,Kyle.

246
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:04,101
Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way.

247
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,895
Yeah,they're invited too.

248
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:08,545
Jason has a huge bulge.
You're gonna get it,boys.

249
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:10,297
Now here's what I'm talking about.

250
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,073
A little midngith blue!

251
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:14,608
Yeah,I'd like to wax his crankshaft!

252
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,792
Be at Bebe's house,tonight,at seven!

253
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,781
Look,here comes Kevin.

254
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:27,642
Hey Kevin,party at my house.

255
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:30,125
I'd like to gargle his marbles.

256
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,715
- Yeah! -You said it.

257
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,070
See you there,Kev.

258
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,576
"Dude,there's Cartman. We should
invite him to the party for sure. "

259
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,959
Fuck you Millie,fuck you Annie,
fuck you Bebe,

260
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,434
fuck you whatever your name is,

261
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,112
and fuck you,bitch!

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,024
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa,that's the
darnedest thing I ever saw.

263
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:58,792
Ms. Hilton? Uh,Ms. Hilton.

264
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,221
Where am I?

265
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:04,467
This room's all middle-class and small!

266
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:07,213
Ms. Hilton,we've talked it over all night and...

267
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:08,734
while your offer is enticing,

268
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:12,136
I'm afraid we just can't sell you
our son for 200 million dollars.

269
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:16,704
It'll have to be 250 million,cash,up front.

270
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:17,951
Oh hamburgers!

271
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:21,496
Yay Mr. Biggles,you're mine forever!

272
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,698
Please! Ah I don't want to live with her!

273
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:25,978
She snores real bad,
and she has a huge nose,

274
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,731
and a squishy thing that lives in her pants!

275
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,613
Please! Please don't sell me to her!

276
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,217
All right,Butters,tell you what:

277
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:36,832
if you can raise the 250 million
dollars yourself,you can stay.

278
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:39,673
Uh,well huh,how am I supposed
to make that kind of money?

279
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,214
It's called "working" young man!

280
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:44,381
Your grandfather was a coal miner
for fifty years; he never complained!

281
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,900
Get out there and start digging!

282
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,171
Y- yes sir!

283
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,834
I- I gotta...mine some coal
really fast!

284
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:54,490
That should keep him busy for a while
while we get this transaction finished.

285
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,510
Now,Ms. Hilton,how should we start?

286
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,859
Okay,that's two minutes.
You can come out,Clyde,Bab.

287
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:10,470
How was he,Bab?

288
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,221
We had a great time,didn't we Clyde?

289
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:24,607
Oh,hey,What's goin' on?
I'm uh,here for the party.

290
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,793
Yeah? Who invited you?

291
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:29,053
Oh uh uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.

292
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:30,125
Kelly who?

293
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,849
Kelly Rutherford Menskin.

294
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,791
Kelly Rutherford Menskin?!

295
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:36,259
Yeah?

296
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:39,129
- Did you invite him? - No!

297
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,171
Oh wait wait wait,aah it wasn't her.
That's right,I forgot,

298
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:45,223
it was uh... Kelly Pinkerton Tinfurter.

299
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,888
Kelly Pinkerton Tinfurter?

300
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:48,220
What?

301
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,771
Oh Goddamnit!

302
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:57,506
Oh,hello Wendy.Are you all right?

303
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:58,943
No,I need help.

304
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:00,632
From from me?

305
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,448
Actually,I was hoping to see your boyfriend.

306
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:05,352
Well sure,come on in.
Mr. Slave is right over here.

307
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,185
Oh Jezuth,Jezuth Christh!

308
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:16,017
Mr. Slave,little Wendy from
class wants to see you.

309
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:19,615
Oh,hi Wendy.You need a little help
with your math homework?

310
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,857
Oh dear. Mr. Slave,I think you and
Wendy better have a little talk.

311
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:28,288
I'll make some cocoa.

312
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:33,115
Mr. Slave,you're the most perverted,
lewd,depraved slut I know.

313
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,440
Thank you sweetie.

314
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,128
Can you teach me your secret fast?

315
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:40,032
Honey,I didn't work to become a whore,
I was born a whore.

316
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:43,514
I've been one...ever since I can remember.

317
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:46,471
Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy...

318
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,124
different things.

319
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:52,541
Mommy,I think I have a fever.
Can you take my temperature?

320
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:56,469
Jezuth Christh.

321
00:14:56,868 --> 00:15:00,709
As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.

322
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:03,718
Hey,there's that queer kid.
Let's tackle him!

323
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:06,886
- Hey yeah,tackle the queer kid!
- We'll show you,queer!

324
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,146
Jezuth Christh!

325
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:15,200
So you see,I can't make you into a whore,Wendy.

326
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,496
But why would you want to be one anyway?

327
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:18,988
Because all the other girls are.

328
00:15:18,988 --> 00:15:21,646
They're having a huge sex party
right now and I'm not invited.

329
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:24,489
A what? For God's sake,where?

330
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:30,685
You work eighteen hours and what do you get?

331
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:33,833
Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.

332
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:40,008
Look at that. A bear,mining for coal.

333
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:42,153
Well. I never.

334
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:47,961
Well Butters,how'd it go? Did you dig
up 200 million dollar's worth of coal?

335
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,849
Well,no,not quite.

336
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:54,217
Well,too bad. Ms. Hilton did raise the
money,so you'll be going off with her.

337
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:56,035
Well ah,shucks!

338
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:59,473
Bye,sweetie,we love you!

339
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,142
Smile Mr. Biggles!

340
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:06,335
This time I have to get a picture of my
new pet BEFORE anything happens.

341
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,500
Before what happens?

342
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,170
MY PETS

343
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:29,439
Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles,come back!

344
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:33,738
You'd better help me find him!
No Mr. Biggles,no money!

345
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:35,633
Oh that troublemaking son of ours!

346
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:38,884
Butters! Butters,you get back here
or you are grounded,mister!

347
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,622
Oh Jezuth!

348
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,330
Kids,kids!

349
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,793
Ew,potty mouth!

350
00:16:58,793 --> 00:16:59,987
Shut off the light.

351
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,203
Oh,thank God.

352
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:03,997
Girls,what on earth are you doing?

353
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:06,095
We're being stupid spoiled whores.

354
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:08,114
H- help! You've gotta hide me!

355
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:10,764
Uh don't tell her I'm in here!

356
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:14,984
What did you do,Wendy? Go rat on us because
you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?

357
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:17,590
Okay,I think this has all gone far enough!

358
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,390
Now look,the last person you
want to be like is Paris Hilton!

359
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,300
Mr. Biggles!

360
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,630
Paris Hilton is a nobody!

361
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,561
She may have money,but she's a
thoughtless,talentless lowlife!

362
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:31,973
Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?

363
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:35,611
Wow,Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!

364
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:41,693
Hon,will you just tell these girls that
being a whore isn't such a great thing.

365
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,146
What isn't great about it?

366
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,598
What's more to life than partying?

367
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:51,114
Look girls,I've partied a lot. Okay?
And I'm telling you,there's more to life.

368
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:54,153
You don't even know what partying is,loser.

369
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,563
Sweetie,really,don't go there,okay?

370
00:17:56,563 --> 00:18:00,888
Oh I went there. I went there, took
some pictures,and flew back already.

371
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:03,681
Wow,what a bitch.

372
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:08,020
Sweetie,listen,I know you've done some
partying in your private little rich life,

373
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,818
but you don't even wanna know
the kind of stuff I've done.

374
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:14,190
I'm the real whore, and I'm
telling you,it isn't great.

375
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,699
Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!

376
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,313
- Whore-off! - Whore-off!

377
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:27,608
Ahh testing? Hello?
Okay uh,welcome everyone.

378
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:32,344
The South Park Chamber of Commerce is
pleased to bring you the first annual...

379
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,750
"Who Is The Biggest Whore" showdown.

380
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:40,106
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.

381
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:41,472
Paris is gonna rock his world.

382
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:45,780
I'm... not quite sure how we...
start this competition off,but uh-

383
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,140
I'll show ya how we start it off.

384
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,973
What is Mr. Slave doing?
He he's just sitting there.

385
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,881
Give him time,Wendy. Give him time.

386
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,579
Come on,Mr. Slave.

387
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:06,925
Back off!
None of you losers are enough for me!

388
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,129
Oh no she di'int.

389
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:39,266
Jezuth.

390
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,063
Jezuth.

391
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:04,941
Now,that's a whore!

392
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,186
Wow,I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.

393
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:14,034
People,don't applaud me.
I'm a dirty whore.

394
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:20,364
Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is
supposed to be a bad thing,remember?

395
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:25,480
Parents,if you don't teach your children that
people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised,

396
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,386
where are they gonna learn it?

397
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,419
You have to be the-

398
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:30,574
Jezuth Christh.

399
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:35,163
You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters
aren't looking up to the wrong people.

400
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:40,274
The homosexual is right. From now on,Bebe,
you're going to dress like a little girl.

401
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:42,388
Wendy,we're sorry we called you names.

402
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:44,091
Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.

403
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:46,180
Yeah,and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore.

404
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,459
That's okay,you guys.

405
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,681
So- so that's it? No 200 million dollars?

406
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,132
Well,Butters, I hope you're happy!

407
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:58,033
I'm a bad bear.
I'm a very bad old bear.

408
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,834
You're grounded,old bear.

409
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,504
Oh my God,it's so gross!
Let me out of here!

410
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:13,268
What the fuck is that?

411
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:18,401
Paris,you must find the way out
of this place or you'll surely die.

412
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:19,811
What?

413
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,820
Make your way to the small intestine.
There you will meet the Sparrow Prince,

414
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,761
 who can guide you to Catatafish.
Now go,Paris Hilton. Make haste!

415
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,667
*A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.*

416
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:37,359
*Hurry onward Paris Hilton
or you will soon be dead.*
