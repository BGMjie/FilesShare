1
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,451
<i>Aaah. Dickens.</i>

2
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:20,335
<i>The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings. </i>

3
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:22,872
<i>Hello, I'm a British person. </i>

4
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:28,345
<i>For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park.</i>

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:32,043
<i>However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from.</i>

6
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:39,732
<i>He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, "Great Expectations"</i>

7
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:45,095
<i>And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show,</i>

8
00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:50,327
<i>and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end.</i>

9
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:56,578
<i>Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd… read the Cliff Notes themselves.</i>

10
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,426
<i>Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot,</i>

11
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:09,096
<i>where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents.</i>

12
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,165
Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again.

13
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:22,409
Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me.

14
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,825
She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together.

15
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:33,208
But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon.

16
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,275
Wha' are you doin' 'ere,
you little whippersham!

17
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,869
Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict.

18
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,659
Did we breaky-wakys out of prison?

19
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:47,961
Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you.

20
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:48,980
Wha' are you doin' wit' those?

21
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:53,117
I'm an apprentice blacksmith. There you are. And here's a sandwich. You must be starving!

22
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,223
Here. W-why are you easy to help me?

23
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:00,494
Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same.

24
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:05,226
Don't quite outmart this thing, I'm afraid.

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,624
Pip, where 'ave you been?!

26
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:10,937
Lovely day, isn't it?

27
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:14,888
What the hell's lovely about it?! Joe,
teach this boy some bloody cynicsim!

28
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:19,424
I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing.

29
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:23,038
Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker.

30
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:27,133
A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death!

31
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,911
Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!

32
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:33,595
Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange.

33
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,798
STOP your metal orange, you bastard! 

34
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:40,342
You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy!

35
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:43,972
And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!

36
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:48,597
Oh, lookie heeah! I've gone
and made a metal newspaper!

37
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:52,796
Shut up, you silly lip! What are we
supposed to do with a metal newspaper?

38
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:58,024
Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job.

39
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:01,746
Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!

40
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,614
-Where?
-Where?

41
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:06,523
Havesham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter.

42
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:09,795
Will pay up to…" TWENTY QUID A DAY??"

43
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,705
That's a lot of money-loney.

44
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,982
You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip.

45
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:18,484
And Old Mrs. Havesham is the wealthiest woman in the town.

46
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:24,207
<i>Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havesham's house to inquire about the job.</i>

47
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:28,056
<i>And it was there that he met the girl of his dreams.</i>

48
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:30,004
Who are you?!

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,416
…I've come to answer the want ad.

50
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:34,420
Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!

51
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:35,185
What??

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,407
This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge!

53
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:43,126
This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis.

54
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:48,648
Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit!

55
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:50,736
In here.

56
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:51,942
Eho. After you, miss.

57
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,636
I'm not going in there, you stupid
puddle of a homeless man urine!

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,003
Who is that?

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,641
I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.

60
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,238
Come closer. Look at me.

61
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,808
Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?

62
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:16,084
Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these… days.

63
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:23,283
I sometimes have sick fancies. And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play.

64
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,814
Estella, play with this boy.

65
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:33,834
With HIM? But he's just a commoner!

66
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:37,256
But, you can break his heart.

67
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,778
…Alright, boy, let us play.

68
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,520
Righty-o. What are we going to play?

69
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:46,604
We're going to play a little game called, "Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."

70
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,454
Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game
at home all the time! Who will go first?

71
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,223
Oh, you stupid pathetic boy!

72
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:57,243
What do you think of her?

73
00:04:57,278 --> 00:05:00,260
Well, uh… I think she's very pretty.

74
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:01,633
Hm-m-m.
What else?

75
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,132
I think she's rather insulting.

76
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:09,069
Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall "play" some more.

77
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:17,204
<i>That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind.</i>

78
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,164
Stop dreaming about me, you
slow-witted rectal belch!

79
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:26,181
<i>Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk.</i>

80
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:29,363
<i>But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew.</i>

81
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:33,012
Don't you wanna play anymore?

82
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,677
Boy, do you still think I'm pretty?

83
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:37,636
Oho. Well, yes, miss.

84
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,289
And, do you still think I'm insulting?

85
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,462
Oh, um, not so much as before. Ow!

86
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:45,663
I hate you! You're an oozing,
painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!

87
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:46,392
Oh, dear.

88
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:51,677
You may kiss me if you like. Come.
Let us walk in the daisy garden.

89
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:56,820
Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain! You there, the prowling little boy!

90
00:05:56,821 --> 00:06:00,000
I bet you can't jump on my back! Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!

91
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:00,877
Who is that?

92
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:05,218
Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?

93
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,858
Oh I… rather thought I was.

94
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:11,269
Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come,
let us walk through the rose garden.

95
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:16,983
Yes, good. She will break his
pathetic heart into a million pieces.

96
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:24,918
<i>Well, what a spot poor Pip was in.</i>

97
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,877
<i>He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella.</i>

98
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:32,255
<i>And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt,</i>

99
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:35,707
<i>Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day.</i>

100
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:40,524
<i>Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely?? But, isn't it sad?</i>

101
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:45,659
<i>Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him,</i>

102
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,898
<i>...for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice.</i>

103
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:54,544
And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. 

104
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,081
Your very own metal fuzzy dice.

105
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,299
Yes. I see. Hoh, lovely.

106
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,188
Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?

107
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,727
Joe, do you know anything about girls?

108
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:07,136
Sure! They're those things
with vaginas in them.

109
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:11,672
But, do you anything about
them? About how they work.

110
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:16,092
Oh, I don't know about that. I just
like to keep to me blacksmithin'.

111
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:19,944
Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?

112
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:26,132
Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think
so, Pip. Who could that be?

113
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,979
Joe, the blacksmith?

114
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:28,818
The same.

115
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,900
I'm a lawyer from London in
search of a young lad named Pip.

116
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:32,725
I'm Pip, sir.

117
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,599
Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice.

118
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:40,241
Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.

119
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:44,942
I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. Do you still object?

120
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:48,344
Heaven forbid I should stand
in the way of Pip's future, but-

121
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:50,478
He will one day inherit a handsome property.

122
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,621
But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.

123
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:56,999
That's great news!

124
00:07:57,034 --> 00:08:01,117
There's only one condition, Pip. Your
benefactor wishes to remain anonymous

125
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,915
Oho. But it must be Ms. Havesham!

126
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,354
OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?

127
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:08,066
Yes sir.

128
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:13,194
Then you will go to London in a week's time. Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned.

129
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,167
I am, sir.

130
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,563
Then I should take my leave. Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip.

131
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,412
Good-bye, sir.

132
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:24,852
Pip! A young gentleman!
Of great expectations!

133
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:35,921
You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket.

134
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:40,923
He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?

135
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:41,716
None, sir.

136
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:45,667
I should think not. On up, then,
and prepare for school on the morrow.

137
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:47,120
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

138
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,538
Mr. Pip?

139
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:54,303
Mr. Pocket?

140
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:55,116
Pray, come in!

141
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,907
Thank you kindly. You
do look rather familiar

142
00:08:57,942 --> 00:09:00,163
As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before.

143
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,177
As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. 

144
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:04,599
This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth. 

145
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,397
This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom.

146
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,283
My, how lovely.

147
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:11,801
Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. 

148
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,794
Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them! I'm quite ashamed!

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,353
Oh it's… quite alright. Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havesham's house!

150
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:23,511
Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!

151
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:26,276
Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms.
Havesham is very generous indeed.

152
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:29,554
That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!

153
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:30,363
Well, what do you mean?

154
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,299
Well, don't you know about Ms. Havesham's melancholy past?

155
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,473
Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come! 

156
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:38,605
Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havesham.

157
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:41,509
Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman!

158
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,514
For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?

159
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:48,044
You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havesham: 

160
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,400
She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.

161
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:54,651
And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth.

162
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:55,887
Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!

163
00:09:55,922 --> 00:10:00,110
Not at all, I'm sure. Anyway, Ms. Havesham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, 

164
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:05,260
which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler.

165
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:05,926
Sorry! Sorry!

166
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:09,738
Not at all, I'm sure. So this man pursued Ms. Havesham closely and professed to be devoted to her. 

167
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,192
She passionately loved him back.

168
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,704
The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came.

169
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:19,761
But not the groom. And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!

170
00:10:19,903 --> 00:10:20,739
Oh. Excuse me.

171
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:22,011
Not at all, I'm sure. 

172
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:26,713
So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havesham received 20 minutes before the wedding.

173
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,548
At half nine, the time when she
stopped all the clocks in the house.

174
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:33,977
But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day.

175
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:38,576
And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.

176
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,475
Terribly sorry, Pocket,

177
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,887
Not at all, I'm sure!

178
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:45,644
<i>And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman.</i>

179
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,558
<i>He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship,</i>

180
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:52,156
<i>and he was shown how to dance and eat box.</i>

181
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:58,642
<i>And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. </i>

182
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:05,118
<i>Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havesham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, </i>

183
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:08,891
<i>...and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella.</i>

184
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:09,978
Good evening, Ms. Havesham.

185
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:13,419
Come closer, Pip. My, you're
quite the gentleman now, aren't you?

186
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:14,205
Thanks to you.

187
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,438
Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well. She's become quite the lady.

188
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,283
Would you like to see a picture of her?

189
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:22,580
Oh, my! She is even
prettier than before.

190
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,887
Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?

191
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:27,436
I don't know. I mean, I
think about her every day.

192
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:29,192
Do you know what love is, Pip?

193
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:36,595
It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world,

194
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,197
...giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.

195
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,193
Righto.

196
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:44,898
Love her, Pip. I developed her into
what she is so that she might… be loved.

197
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,925
Yes, but… where will I find her?

198
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,844
There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there.

199
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:53,088
Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!

200
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:56,517
Thank you, Ms. Havesham! For everything!
I'm the happiest boy in the land!

201
00:11:56,552 --> 00:12:04,399
And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. Lover her.

202
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:11,897
<i>Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way.</i>

203
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:16,789
<i>From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations.</i>

204
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,485
<i>And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella</i>

205
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:23,510
<i>...again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair.</i>

206
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:27,669
<i>It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend.</i>

207
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,557
<i>And all would be right with the world.</i>

208
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,918
Hello, Estella.

209
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:39,709
Pip. My goodness, how you've changed!

210
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:42,255
Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?

211
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:48,614
I suppose. So how is it that
you've learned to dress and dance?

212
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:50,527
Well, I was sent to
be schooled in London.

213
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,360
Iiii see, and you no longer
live with the blacksmith?

214
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:58,191
Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.

215
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:58,895
Naturally.

216
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,512
It is wonderful to
see you again, Estella.

217
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:05,537
Is it? Why?

218
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:07,159
Because I believe I'm in love with you.

219
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:09,594
Pip, you must know that I have no heart.

220
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:10,656
I think you do.

221
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:15,949
Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but 

222
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,914
...you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment.

223
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:23,284
I see past that, Estella. I see a little
girl who wants to be warm and kind.

224
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,899
Hey, Estella, let's get out of here.

225
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,997
Alright, Steve. Just one moment.

226
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:29,734
Who…? Who is that?

227
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,837
That is Steve. He is
seventeen and has a car.

228
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:34,556
I see, and you… fancy this Steve fellow?

229
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,165
I should. He's my boyfriend.

230
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,113
Boyfriend??

231
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,128
What's the matter, Pip?!

232
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:40,135
I don't understand! I did everything right! 

233
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:43,008
I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!

234
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:47,358
It's… it's… the way it goes sometimes, Pip. He's… seventeen and has a car.

235
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,826
I'm… I'm… very I'm leaving.

236
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,727
Ms. Havesham! You have to talk to
Estella! She's going out with a-

237
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:02,893
Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip.

238
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,461
Ms. Havesham! But um…

239
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:09,443
Don't they make a handsome couple,
Pip? Look at the way he holds her hand.

240
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:13,949
But I don't understand. You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estalla.

241
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:16,424
Things aren't always as they seem, Pip.

242
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:21,276
Oh, what's the matter? Did she… break your heart?

243
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:27,431
…Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. 

244
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,254
Because it certainly does hurt.

245
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:33,976
Yes. Tell me about the pain. Tell me
about the crushing and the prickly things.

246
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:39,454
It's… a-as if… sssomeone has a hold of my
heart and isss squeezing it very tightly.

247
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,965
Yes, and it is somewhat
difficult to breathe.

248
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,394
Hey, wait a second. You mean that this
whole thing was just a setup by your mom?

249
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:49,358
Is your heart broken as
well? Tell me all about it.

250
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:51,087
But why do you make your
daughter hurt people?

251
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:53,472
Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple.

252
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:58,351
Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.

253
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:02,391
You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. 

254
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:06,178
But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. 

255
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:10,285
And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation.

256
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,183
What the hell??

257
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:14,560
Estella, prepare yourself
for the Genesis platform.

258
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:20,815
Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm
not lettin' you walk out on me! What the?!

259
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:26,302
And as for you, Pip, my robot
monkeys should take care of you!

260
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:38,513
Pip? Pip, old chap?

261
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:39,384
Joe?

262
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:41,982
That's right. You're safe and warm now.

263
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:44,236
Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip,

264
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:47,041
You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours.

265
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:50,895
Ms Havesham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!


266
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:54,335
Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?

267
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,331
Well, about that, Pip: There's
another person who wants to see you.

268
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,495
Allo, Pip. You remember me?

269
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,190
I'll rip off your arms
and shove 'em up your arse!

270
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:07,192
Why, you're the escaped convict
I helped a long time ago.

271
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:11,323
Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself.

272
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:14,436
If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire.

273
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,725
E's the one that sent you to London, Pip!

274
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,726
'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!

275
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,019
You? But why?

276
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:25,166
Because back then you treated me like any other person.

277
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,978
You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.

278
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:32,698
Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was
Ms. Havesham. She totally let me believe it.

279
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:37,445
I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex.

280
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,460
Well, I've certainly learned a lot.

281
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:43,264
That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners.

282
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:46,831
It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.

283
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:47,992
Righto. Pip. Righto.

284
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:51,057
And now I suppose there's
only one thing left to do.

285
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,001
What's that, Pip.

286
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:57,241
If Ms. Havesham is determined to do
this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!

287
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:58,435
Yeah!

288
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:05,219
<i>And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale,</i>

289
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,081
<i>in which the stage is set for an epic showdown.</i>

290
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:11,449
<i>Ms. Havesham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but</i>

291
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,414
<i>Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device.</i>

292
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:20,912
<i>And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!</i>

293
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,838
Are you ready, Estella? Are
you ready to complete the cycle?

294
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:29,116
Yes, Mother.

295
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,470
Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.

296
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:34,880
Pip?

297
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:39,793
Your manhating days
are over, Ms. Havesham!

298
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:44,425
Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge
on the male race is only about to begin.

299
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,685
Dear God, Pip, look!

300
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,799
Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!

301
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,570
-So am I.
-And me.

302
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:53,854
We were all Estella's boyfriends at
one time or another. Now we're doomed.

303
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,789
Yes. Cry away, males.

304
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,927
Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.

305
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,125
You won't get away with this!

306
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:09,930
Won't I? Let the transformation begin.

307
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,283
Pip, she started the device!

308
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,619
Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever
it takes to keep those blokes from crying!

309
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:19,702
Righto, Pip.

310
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:20,957
It begins.

311
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,188
Come, Estella! You can't
want to be part of this.

312
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:25,028
It is… what I was raised for.

313
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:29,222
Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry.

314
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:31,899
Havesham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.

315
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:36,304
How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!

316
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:39,204
Yes, but just thnk about… panda bears!

317
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:43,991
Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are. What silly little noses they have!

318
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,768
Panda bears make me sad.
They're almost extinct.

319
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:50,942
Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about …swimming!

320
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:54,703
Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive.

321
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:57,069
…Yes…

322
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,036
Get out of that chair, you old cow!

323
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:05,451
Estella! Listen to me! You are a
wonderful girl, with a kind heart.

324
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:07,418
I told you, Pip. I have no heart

325
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:10,668
But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!

326
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,279
Look at this adorable little bunny.

327
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,465
Oh my. 'E's very cute.

328
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,559
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.

329
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:28,642
…Oh. But look at this bunny. There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies. 

330
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,100
…Right.

331
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,120
Oh what fun it is to collect stamps!

332
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:38,555
Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors.

333
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,093
My father died in a
stamp-collecting accident.

334
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:44,598
Right, let's not talk about
stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about…

335
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:45,760
Ice-skating!

336
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:50,388
Oh what fun ice-skating is! Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.

337
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,461
Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!

338
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:56,319
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. 

339
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,009
So you do have too  big a heart to- 

340
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,315
Ten baby bunnies!

341
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,825
…There's too many of them!

342
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,465
Please, sirs, you must not cry!

343
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,707
We can't help it! You're
bawlin' us to tears!

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,744
Philip, it's too late!!

345
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,386
Twenty-six baby bunnies

346
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,783
I don't want to. I don't
see the point in this.

347
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:17,428
What?

348
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:18,975
I don't want to kill any more of them.

349
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,430
There! You see?! You do have a heart!

350
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,897
You think so? Let me see
it Maybe I can kill it.

351
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:29,034
No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now!

352
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:31,957
Yessss!

353
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:39,940
Noooo!

354
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,397
Ooooo, top smart, Pip!

355
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,540
You did it, Pip!

356
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,319
Well, I guess Old Ms. Havesham won't be
takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?

357
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,100
Yes. her poor miserable
life is finally over.

358
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:01,877
You're released from her now, Estella!
Now we can begin our life together!

359
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,129
Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love!

360
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:08,569
Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out. Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?

361
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:11,777
<i>And they all lived happily ever after. </i>

362
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:14,825
<i>Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B.</i>

363
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:19,129
<i>So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectatoins.</i>

364
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:25,791
<i>We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed, all masterpieces of literature like this one.</i>

365
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:30,542
<i>Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night.</i>
