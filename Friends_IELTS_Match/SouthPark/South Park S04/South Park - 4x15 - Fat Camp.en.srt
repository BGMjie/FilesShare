<SYNC Start=14390 End=15891><P Class=ZHCC>
? Humble folks<br>without temptation?

<SYNC Start=30908 End=32607><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=32607><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=35878 End=37612><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, children,<br>as i'm sure you all remember,
<SYNC Start=38047 End=40215><P Class=ZHCC>
Today we're gonna continue<br>our biology lesson
<SYNC Start=40251 End=42384><P Class=ZHCC>
By dissecting an organism.
<SYNC Start=42420 End=43650><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah!<br>Woo-Hoo!
<SYNC Start=43686 End=45420><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, what we are going to<br>dissect today
<SYNC Start=45456 End=47155><P Class=ZHCC>
Is the west indian manatee.
<SYNC Start=47590 End=49723><P Class=ZHCC>
Manatees are mammals<br>that live in the oceans
<SYNC Start=49759 End=52360><P Class=ZHCC>
And are often called<br>"the gentle clowns of the sea".
<SYNC Start=52396 End=54963><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, miss choksondik,<br>aren't manatees endangered?
<SYNC Start=54999 End=56663><P Class=ZHCC>
They sure are, wendy.
<SYNC Start=56699 End=58867><P Class=ZHCC>
And that's why we must learn<br>what's inside them.
<SYNC Start=59302 End=61868><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, we don't have quite enough<br>manatees to go around
<SYNC Start=61904 End=64072><P Class=ZHCC>
So i think we're gonna have to<br>split up into groups of four.
<SYNC Start=64273 End=66241><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, ours is<br>still alive!
<SYNC Start=66277 End=67993><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, hold on.
<SYNC Start=68029 End=69676><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, uh!
<SYNC Start=69712 End=73181><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, children, our first incision<br>will be along the abdomen.
<SYNC Start=73217 End=74014><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't do it, dude.
<SYNC Start=74050 End=74916><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, don't be<br>such a baby.
<SYNC Start=75351 End=76217><P Class=ZHCC>
You do it, kenny.
<SYNC Start=76253 End=77484><P Class=ZHCC>
Unh-Uh.
<SYNC Start=77520 End=79254><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on, kenny, i'll give you<br>five bucks to do it.
<SYNC Start=79290 End=80954><P Class=ZHCC>
Five bucks!
<SYNC Start=80990 End=83158><P Class=ZHCC>
Too bad cartman's missing this,<br>he must be really sick.
<SYNC Start=83194 End=84459><P Class=ZHCC>
Say, terrance,
<SYNC Start=84627 End=86194><P Class=ZHCC>
This body appears to have<br>been moved since the murder.
<SYNC Start=86230 End=88363><P Class=ZHCC>
Look at the forensic evidence<br>around the torso.
<SYNC Start=88399 End=89664><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't see anything.
<SYNC Start=90099 End=91399><P Class=ZHCC>
Look closer.
<SYNC Start=91834 End=93533><P Class=ZHCC>
Closer.
<SYNC Start=93569 End=96605><P Class=ZHCC>
I still don't see<br>anything, phillip.
<SYNC Start=96641 End=97472><P Class=ZHCC>
Wait, wait.
<SYNC Start=97907 End=99207><P Class=ZHCC>
I know what's gonna<br>happen, mom.
<SYNC Start=99243 End=100473><P Class=ZHCC>
You wanna know<br>what's gonna happen?
<SYNC Start=100509 End=102677><P Class=ZHCC>
Keep looking, terrance, the forensic<br>evidence is right around here.
<SYNC Start=102677><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=110052 End=111751><P Class=ZHCC>
Whoa, that totally<br>surprised me!
<SYNC Start=111787 End=114389><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't believe how this show<br>manages to stay fresh, huh, mom?
<SYNC Start=114425 End=115256><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, sweetie.
<SYNC Start=115292 End=116558><P Class=ZHCC>
Mom...
<SYNC Start=116993 End=119160><P Class=ZHCC>
Can you go make me a toaster-Pastry-<br>Chocolate-Mix-Butter bar?
<SYNC Start=119196 End=121763><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, honey, why don't you<br>go make it yourself.
<SYNC Start=122198 End=124331><P Class=ZHCC>
Mommy's expecting<br>some company.
<SYNC Start=124367 End=126968><P Class=ZHCC>
God, i have to do<br>everything around here!
<SYNC Start=126968><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=128704 End=130005><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=130005><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=132174 End=134125><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=134161 End=136077><P Class=ZHCC>
? Someone who<br>loves you tender?
<SYNC Start=136113 End=137812><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=137812><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=142585 End=144753><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=144789 End=146453><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=146489 End=148622><P Class=ZHCC>
What the hell's<br>going on?
<SYNC Start=148658 End=152994><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted<br>to have a "talk" with you.
<SYNC Start=153030 End=155128><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, your friends<br>and your family
<SYNC Start=155164 End=158633><P Class=ZHCC>
Are all concerned about<br>your weight, m'kay.
<SYNC Start=158669 End=159501><P Class=ZHCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=159935 End=161236><P Class=ZHCC>
We believe that you<br>might have a problem.
<SYNC Start=161671 End=162936><P Class=ZHCC>
You're goddamn right<br>i have a problem!
<SYNC Start=162972 End=164706><P Class=ZHCC>
"Terrance and phillip" is on<br>and i don't have anywhere to sit!
<SYNC Start=165141 End=166007><P Class=ZHCC>
Now what the hell<br>is this?!
<SYNC Start=166442 End=167308><P Class=ZHCC>
It's called<br>intervention, eric.
<SYNC Start=167743 End=169009><P Class=ZHCC>
Your friends and i<br>have all chipped in
<SYNC Start=169045 End=172514><P Class=ZHCC>
And we're going to send you up<br>to a weight management retreat.
<SYNC Start=172550 End=174683><P Class=ZHCC>
Fat camp?<br>Yes, fat camp.
<SYNC Start=175117 End=176418><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, i don't know who<br>the hell put you all up to this,
<SYNC Start=176852 End=179454><P Class=ZHCC>
But i am sure as hell not going<br>to any gay-Ass fat camp!
<SYNC Start=179588 End=181154><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, eric, all these<br>people came here
<SYNC Start=181190 End=183792><P Class=ZHCC>
And paid to send you to camp<br>because they care about you.
<SYNC Start=183828 End=185492><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, except for me.
<SYNC Start=185528 End=187696><P Class=ZHCC>
I just wanted to see the look<br>on your face when they told you.
<SYNC Start=188130 End=188962><P Class=ZHCC>
Mom, tell them.
<SYNC Start=188998 End=190298><P Class=ZHCC>
Tell them i'm not fat,<br>i'm just big-Boned.
<SYNC Start=190733 End=192033><P Class=ZHCC>
Tell them all the stories about<br>how everyone in your family
<SYNC Start=192468 End=193768><P Class=ZHCC>
Was big as a child but then<br>grew into their bodies.
<SYNC Start=194203 End=195937><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, sweetie,<br>those were all lies.
<SYNC Start=196372 End=198106><P Class=ZHCC>
You're just fat.
<SYNC Start=198106><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=200276 End=202409><P Class=ZHCC>
And now, we will be<br>removing the spleen.
<SYNC Start=202445 End=204577><P Class=ZHCC>
Notice how the manatee's<br>spleen is designed for-
<SYNC Start=204613 End=208516><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah, miss choksondik, can we have<br>a quick word with you? All right.
<SYNC Start=208951 End=211553><P Class=ZHCC>
Continue with the removal of the<br>spleen, children, i'll be right back.
<SYNC Start=211589 End=213288><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, dude,<br>check this out.
<SYNC Start=213324 End=214554><P Class=ZHCC>
That's so gross.
<SYNC Start=214590 End=216324><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, kenny, how much<br>for you to eat this?
<SYNC Start=216360 End=217157><P Class=ZHCC>
I won't eat it.
<SYNC Start=217193 End=218493><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll give you 10 bucks<br>to eat it.
<SYNC Start=218529 End=219759><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll throw in five.
<SYNC Start=219795 End=221494><P Class=ZHCC>
And so apparently there's<br>been a little mix-Up.
<SYNC Start=221530 End=224132><P Class=ZHCC>
The manatees were meant to go<br>to the denver shelter aquarium
<SYNC Start=224168 End=226301><P Class=ZHCC>
And the frogs<br>were meant to come here.
<SYNC Start=226337 End=227567><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh dear.
<SYNC Start=227603 End=229302><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll throw in a dollar! I got three.
<SYNC Start=229338 End=231072><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on, dude, all you gotta do<br>is eat it really fast.
<SYNC Start=231108 End=232373><P Class=ZHCC>
41 bucks.
<SYNC Start=232373><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=234543 End=235809><P Class=ZHCC>
Eww-Hoo!<br>He did it.
<SYNC Start=235845 End=239314><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, children, now,<br>let's get back in our seats.
<SYNC Start=239350 End=242784><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, we are now going to put<br>the manatees back together.
<SYNC Start=242784><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=245821 End=247989><P Class=ZHCC>
And it has basketball courts<br>and tennis courts.
<SYNC Start=248025 End=251459><P Class=ZHCC>
And you can call mommy<br>anytime you want.
<SYNC Start=251495 End=254027><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, sweetie-Kins,<br>don't be mad,
<SYNC Start=254063 End=255762><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm sure you're going to<br>have a good time.
<SYNC Start=255798 End=258833><P Class=ZHCC>
And when you come back,<br>you'll be all healthy and thin.
<SYNC Start=258869 End=261870><P Class=ZHCC>
Howdy there, i'm one of<br>the weight counselors here.
<SYNC Start=262304 End=263570><P Class=ZHCC>
This must be eric cartman.
<SYNC Start=263606 End=265774><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, i'm afraid<br>he's a little moody.
<SYNC Start=265810 End=267474><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, we'll change that.
<SYNC Start=267510 End=270111><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello, camper, my name is rick,<br>how are you doing?
<SYNC Start=270147 End=272714><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, i'm pissed off, rick,<br>how are you?
<SYNC Start=272750 End=274414><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm doing great!
<SYNC Start=274450 End=276184><P Class=ZHCC>
Why don't you come on out<br>and we'll get you oriented.
<SYNC Start=276220 End=278353><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll take care of him<br>from here, ma'am.
<SYNC Start=278788 End=280522><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, well,<br>good-Bye, sweetie.
<SYNC Start=280558 End=282222><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't touch me.
<SYNC Start=282258 End=285727><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, this is the beginning<br>of a whole new life for you!
<SYNC Start=285727><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=290933 End=292632><P Class=ZHCC>
Have you got any candy?<br>No.
<SYNC Start=292668 End=294402><P Class=ZHCC>
My mom says i ain't to<br>eat no candy here,
<SYNC Start=294438 End=295703><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm supposed to<br>lose weight.
<SYNC Start=295739 End=297005><P Class=ZHCC>
All right!
<SYNC Start=297439 End=299607><P Class=ZHCC>
Everybody's here and that means<br>we can get down to business.
<SYNC Start=300042 End=301342><P Class=ZHCC>
Over the next few weeks<br>we're gonna learn
<SYNC Start=301777 End=303511><P Class=ZHCC>
That losing weight<br>is fun, right, gang?
<SYNC Start=303547 End=305211><P Class=ZHCC>
Right.
<SYNC Start=305247 End=308283><P Class=ZHCC>
Wait a second,<br>do you kids hear something?
<SYNC Start=308319 End=309584><P Class=ZHCC>
Why, i could've<br>swore that-
<SYNC Start=309620 End=310850><P Class=ZHCC>
Rrrar!
<SYNC Start=310886 End=313019><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh no, kids,<br>it's glutinous fat!
<SYNC Start=313055 End=316090><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm gonna take over your body<br>and make you slow.
<SYNC Start=316525 End=318259><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, what are we<br>going to do?
<SYNC Start=318295 End=319526><P Class=ZHCC>
Wait, i know.
<SYNC Start=319562 End=321296><P Class=ZHCC>
I can knock it out,<br>with?
<SYNC Start=321332 End=322562><P Class=ZHCC>
Exercise!
<SYNC Start=322598 End=324332><P Class=ZHCC>
And? Proper diet.
<SYNC Start=324368 End=325598><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh no!
<SYNC Start=325634 End=328635><P Class=ZHCC>
Exercise and proper diet<br>have killed me.
<SYNC Start=328671 End=331706><P Class=ZHCC>
I guess we took care of that<br>bad old fat, didn't we, kids?
<SYNC Start=332141 End=332972><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah!
<SYNC Start=333008 End=334274><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, hold on a second,
<SYNC Start=334310 End=337345><P Class=ZHCC>
Because that glutinous fat was<br>really our good friend susan!
<SYNC Start=337381 End=339531><P Class=ZHCC>
Who's another<br>weight counselor!
<SYNC Start=339567 End=341648><P Class=ZHCC>
Heh, it was a lady<br>in a costume.
<SYNC Start=341684 End=344285><P Class=ZHCC>
Would somebody put this retard<br>out of his misery?
<SYNC Start=344285><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=345588 End=346419><P Class=ZHCC>
What's the matter?
<SYNC Start=346455 End=347322><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny's not feeling<br>so good.
<SYNC Start=347756 End=349022><P Class=ZHCC>
That manatee spleen<br>made him sick.
<SYNC Start=349058 End=350358><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh-Oh, i guess we shouldn't<br>have made him eat it.
<SYNC Start=350358><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=351660 End=353359><P Class=ZHCC>
Eww!
<SYNC Start=353395 End=355780><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, at least you got it<br>out of your system.
<SYNC Start=355816 End=358166><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, dude, you can still<br>kind of see the spleen!
<SYNC Start=358202 End=359432><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=359468 End=361202><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll give you five bucks<br>to eat your puke.
<SYNC Start=361637 End=362503><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm in for five.
<SYNC Start=362539 End=363336><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=368142><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=370746 End=373781><P Class=ZHCC>
That's 19 bucks, kenny.
<SYNC Start=373817 End=375083><P Class=ZHCC>
Ohh!<br>Eww.
<SYNC Start=375517 End=376783><P Class=ZHCC>
Kick ass, dude!
<SYNC Start=376819 End=378518><P Class=ZHCC>
Y'know, dude, there might<br>be something to this.
<SYNC Start=378554 End=382023><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, people are willing to pay big<br>money to see kenny do this stuff.
<SYNC Start=382023><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=384627 End=387228><P Class=ZHCC>

Well, i sure enjoyed<br>my carrots and protein bar,
<SYNC Start=398108 End=399374><P Class=ZHCC>
How about you, gang?
<SYNC Start=399410 End=400206><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm starving.
<SYNC Start=400242 End=401542><P Class=ZHCC>
This is it,<br>i'm going to die here.
<SYNC Start=401977 End=403278><P Class=ZHCC>
I hope you all left room<br>for dessert-
<SYNC Start=403712 End=406314><P Class=ZHCC>
Soybean pudding<br>for everybody!
<SYNC Start=406749 End=408917><P Class=ZHCC>
Are you gonna eat<br>your soybean pudding?
<SYNC Start=409351 End=410617><P Class=ZHCC>

Yeah, well,<br>when i was in prison,
<SYNC Start=414556 End=416941><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=419705 End=422363><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=424533 End=426232><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, clyde frog,
<SYNC Start=426268 End=428870><P Class=ZHCC>
We just gotta clear the<br>counselor building and we're free.
<SYNC Start=428870><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=433208 End=434908><P Class=ZHCC>
We did it,<br>clyde frog!
<SYNC Start=434944 End=437979><P Class=ZHCC>
Now the only question is, do we go<br>home to our traitor mom and friends,
<SYNC Start=438015 End=440581><P Class=ZHCC>
Or do we start<br>a new life on the run?
<SYNC Start=440617 End=442750><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=444053 End=445787><P Class=ZHCC>
Can i interest you<br>in some ice cream?
<SYNC Start=445823 End=447422><P Class=ZHCC>
You're damn right<br>you can!
<SYNC Start=447458 End=449023><P Class=ZHCC>
Two "roller pops",<br>please.
<SYNC Start=449258 End=451859><P Class=ZHCC>
Alrighty, do you want<br>this kind or this kind?
<SYNC Start=451895 End=453594><P Class=ZHCC>
Huh? Oh!
<SYNC Start=453594><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=455331 End=457463><P Class=ZHCC>
They tricked us<br>again, huh?
<SYNC Start=457499 End=460066><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh godammit,<br>let me out of here!
<SYNC Start=460102 End=463137><P Class=ZHCC>
Hang on, we'll be back at camp<br>in a matter of no time.
<SYNC Start=463137><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=466175 End=467475><P Class=ZHCC>
They always get us.
<SYNC Start=467910 End=470511><P Class=ZHCC>
Sometimes it's an ice cream<br>truck, sometimes it's a taco stand.
<SYNC Start=470547 End=471813><P Class=ZHCC>
But they always<br>fool us.
<SYNC Start=471849 End=473513><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't help it.
<SYNC Start=473549 End=475717><P Class=ZHCC>
I'd give anything, any amount<br>of money for some candy.
<SYNC Start=476151 End=477417><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, kids!
<SYNC Start=477453 End=479620><P Class=ZHCC>
Looks like we had some<br>attempted escapees again tonight.
<SYNC Start=480055 End=480887><P Class=ZHCC>
Escape-Aroo.
<SYNC Start=480923 End=483090><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, campers, i know that<br>camp is tough,
<SYNC Start=483126 End=485224><P Class=ZHCC>
But you have to believe<br>that you can do it.
<SYNC Start=485260 End=486995><P Class=ZHCC>
And you have to know that<br>until you drop the weight
<SYNC Start=487429 End=488729><P Class=ZHCC>
You can't leave!
<SYNC Start=488765 End=489996><P Class=ZHCC>
There is no escape.
<SYNC Start=490032 End=491731><P Class=ZHCC>
So, let's just all<br>put on our "try hard" helmets
<SYNC Start=491767 End=493935><P Class=ZHCC>
And accept that the only way<br>for us to get out of camp
<SYNC Start=493971 End=495436><P Class=ZHCC>
Is to lose the weight!
<SYNC Start=495472 End=496537><P Class=ZHCC>
God dammit!
<SYNC Start=496537><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=500876 End=502176><P Class=ZHCC>
Thanks for coming,<br>everybody.
<SYNC Start=502611 End=503911><P Class=ZHCC>
What's all this about,<br>mrs. Cartman,
<SYNC Start=504346 End=506514><P Class=ZHCC>
Is eric having trouble at his<br>weight management camp?
<SYNC Start=506550 End=507382><P Class=ZHCC>
We knew he<br>wouldn't make it.
<SYNC Start=507816 End=509515><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, no,<br>quite the contrary.
<SYNC Start=509551 End=511684><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric showed up and<br>surprised me last night.
<SYNC Start=511720 End=514322><P Class=ZHCC>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br>i would like to present to you
<SYNC Start=514757 End=516491><P Class=ZHCC>
The new eric cartman.
<SYNC Start=516527 End=517792><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, dudes!
<SYNC Start=518227 End=519492><P Class=ZHCC>
Whoa!
<SYNC Start=519528 End=520793><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't believe it.
<SYNC Start=520829 End=523865><P Class=ZHCC>
Believe it, he lost<br>40 pounds at his fat camp.
<SYNC Start=523901 End=526268><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric,<br>that's fantastic, m'kay!
<SYNC Start=526304 End=528636><P Class=ZHCC>
Congratulations,<br>how do you feel?
<SYNC Start=529071 End=529937><P Class=ZHCC>
I feel awesome.
<SYNC Start=530372 End=532071><P Class=ZHCC>
What the hell did they do<br>with all the fat?
<SYNC Start=532107 End=533806><P Class=ZHCC>
That must've been enough to<br>last an eskimo family months.
<SYNC Start=533842 End=536878><P Class=ZHCC>
Y'know, kyle, there was a time when<br>your fat jokes would have gotten to me,
<SYNC Start=536914 End=539012><P Class=ZHCC>
But now i'm totally slim<br>and totally happy.
<SYNC Start=539048 End=542083><P Class=ZHCC>
In fact, i'd say i'm a little<br>bit trimmer than you, fat boy.
<SYNC Start=542119 End=543783><P Class=ZHCC>
Heh heh,<br>just kidding, kyle.
<SYNC Start=543819 End=546421><P Class=ZHCC>
I made some healthy<br>tofu pudding to celebrate.
<SYNC Start=546855 End=548589><P Class=ZHCC>
Who wants some?
<SYNC Start=548625 End=550289><P Class=ZHCC>
Me, me, me, me!
<SYNC Start=550325 End=552493><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, i don't know if i'm<br>gonna like the new eric cartman.
<SYNC Start=552928 End=554627><P Class=ZHCC>
Did you like the old one? Good point.
<SYNC Start=554663 End=558132><P Class=ZHCC>
And now back to "jesus and pals"<br>on south park public access.
<SYNC Start=558567 End=561567><P Class=ZHCC>
Back to our courageous story of a<br>little boy's triumph over obesity.
<SYNC Start=561603 End=565506><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, yea, you found that the spirit of<br>the lord inside you gave you strength.
<SYNC Start=565542 End=567241><P Class=ZHCC>
No, actually i found a diet<br>that totally works.
<SYNC Start=567676 End=569410><P Class=ZHCC>
A little boy<br>who overcame the odds.
<SYNC Start=569845 End=571712><P Class=ZHCC>
Let's hear it<br>for eric cartman!
<SYNC Start=571712><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=573749 End=576350><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, our second guest tonight is<br>a young man named kenny mckormick
<SYNC Start=576386 End=578086><P Class=ZHCC>
Who is going to<br>eat dog crap.
<SYNC Start=578122 End=580254><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny?
<SYNC Start=580254><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=586762 End=588496><P Class=ZHCC>
Whoa!
<SYNC Start=588496><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=597606 End=599305><P Class=ZHCC>
No!
<SYNC Start=599341 End=601075><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes!<br>Woo-Hoo!
<SYNC Start=601510 End=602341><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah!
<SYNC Start=602377 End=604545><P Class=ZHCC>
Dammit, all i got was<br>a little golf clap.
<SYNC Start=604581 End=606714><P Class=ZHCC>
Thanks for coming on<br>the show, kenny. Sure.
<SYNC Start=606750 End=607980><P Class=ZHCC>
Do it again!<br>Do it again!
<SYNC Start=608016 End=610618><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey kid, i'll give you 20 bucks<br>to eat a really old piece of bacon.
<SYNC Start=611053 End=612318><P Class=ZHCC>
This is ridiculous!
<SYNC Start=612354 End=615823><P Class=ZHCC>
So, kenny, how did you discover<br>that you had this talent?
<SYNC Start=615859 End=617090><P Class=ZHCC>
We thought of it, jesus.
<SYNC Start=617126 End=618391><P Class=ZHCC>
I mean, kenny's the one<br>that does it all,
<SYNC Start=618427 End=619727><P Class=ZHCC>
But we were the masterminds<br>of the whole thing.
<SYNC Start=620162 End=621896><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't say i approve<br>of this, my children.
<SYNC Start=621932 End=623596><P Class=ZHCC>
Huh, why not?
<SYNC Start=623632 End=626234><P Class=ZHCC>
Because kenny is only doing<br>things that anybody could do...
<SYNC Start=626270 End=627500><P Class=ZHCC>
For money.
<SYNC Start=627536 End=629235><P Class=ZHCC>
He's a prostitute.
<SYNC Start=629271 End=631873><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat<br>someone else's vomit.
<SYNC Start=631909 End=632740><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, go for it!<br>Yeah!
<SYNC Start=633175 End=634041><P Class=ZHCC>
What's a prostitute?
<SYNC Start=634077 End=635343><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't know.
<SYNC Start=635343><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=637513 End=639247><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello there, children.
<SYNC Start=639681 End=640513><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, chef! Hey, chef!
<SYNC Start=640549 End=642717><P Class=ZHCC>
Chef, what's a<br>prostitute?
<SYNC Start=642753 End=643983><P Class=ZHCC>
Dag nabbit, children!
<SYNC Start=644019 End=645319><P Class=ZHCC>
How come every time<br>you come in here
<SYNC Start=645754 End=647488><P Class=ZHCC>
You gotta be asking me questions<br>i shouldn't be answering?
<SYNC Start=647923 End=650091><P Class=ZHCC>
"Chef, what's a clitoris?<br>What's a lesbian, chef?
<SYNC Start=650127 End=652225><P Class=ZHCC>
How come they call it<br>a 'rim job', chef?"
<SYNC Start=652261 End=653995><P Class=ZHCC>
For once, can't you just<br>come in here and say,
<SYNC Start=654031 End=655747><P Class=ZHCC>
"Hi, chef,<br>nice day, isn't it?"
<SYNC Start=655783 End=657465><P Class=ZHCC>
Hi, chef,<br>nice day, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=657501 End=659165><P Class=ZHCC>
It sure is,<br>thank you.
<SYNC Start=659201 End=660935><P Class=ZHCC>
Chef,<br>what's a prostitute?
<SYNC Start=661136 End=663971><P Class=ZHCC>
Unh-Uh, you children are gonna get me<br>in trouble with the principal again.
<SYNC Start=664007 End=665273><P Class=ZHCC>
Lunchtime,<br>i'm starved!
<SYNC Start=665309 End=667008><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my god!<br>Eric?
<SYNC Start=667044 End=668309><P Class=ZHCC>
That's me.
<SYNC Start=668744 End=671128><P Class=ZHCC>
Chef was just about to<br>tell us what a prostitute is.
<SYNC Start=671164 End=673640><P Class=ZHCC>
Why do you need to know what<br>a prostitute is anyway?
<SYNC Start=673676 End=676117><P Class=ZHCC>
Because jesus told us that<br>kenny's a prostitute, is he?
<SYNC Start=676153 End=677383><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, am i?
<SYNC Start=677419 End=680021><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, no, of course kenny<br>is not a prostitute.
<SYNC Start=680057 End=681287><P Class=ZHCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=681323 End=683491><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, because, children,<br>a prostitute is someone who...
<SYNC Start=683527 End=686093><P Class=ZHCC>
You can pay for<br>certain services.
<SYNC Start=686129 End=687360><P Class=ZHCC>
Like what?
<SYNC Start=687396 End=690396><P Class=ZHCC>
Like keeping you company<br>- Understand? No.
<SYNC Start=690432 End=692600><P Class=ZHCC>
You see, children, sometimes<br>a man needs to be with a woman,
<SYNC Start=692636 End=694300><P Class=ZHCC>
But sometimes,<br>when the lovin' is over,
<SYNC Start=694336 End=697371><P Class=ZHCC>
The woman just want to talk<br>and talk and talk and talk.
<SYNC Start=697806 End=700841><P Class=ZHCC>
? But a prostitute is someone<br>who would love you?
<SYNC Start=700877 End=703878><P Class=ZHCC>
? No matter who you are<br>or what you look like?
<SYNC Start=704313 End=706480><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, it's true children.
<SYNC Start=706915 End=708649><P Class=ZHCC>
? That's not why you<br>pay a prostitute?
<SYNC Start=709084 End=711252><P Class=ZHCC>
? No, you don't<br>pay for her to stay?
<SYNC Start=711288 End=713386><P Class=ZHCC>
? You're paying her<br>to leave afterward?
<SYNC Start=713422 End=717325><P Class=ZHCC>
? That's why i praise the lord<br>for prostitute?
<SYNC Start=717361 End=719945><P Class=ZHCC>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br>mr. James taylor.
<SYNC Start=719981 End=722122><P Class=ZHCC>
? A prostitute is like<br>any other woman?
<SYNC Start=722158 End=724265><P Class=ZHCC>
? They all trade<br>something for sex?
<SYNC Start=724301 End=726832><P Class=ZHCC>
? And they do it well?
<SYNC Start=726868 End=729904><P Class=ZHCC>
? That's why i say<br>prostitutes, prostitutes?
<SYNC Start=729940 End=733773><P Class=ZHCC>
They- Ohh!
<SYNC Start=733809 End=736410><P Class=ZHCC>
James taylor, what the hell<br>you doing in here,
<SYNC Start=736446 End=739013><P Class=ZHCC>
Singing about prostitutes<br>to the children?
<SYNC Start=739049 End=742014><P Class=ZHCC>
Get out of here!
<SYNC Start=742050 End=745086><P Class=ZHCC>
These children<br>tricked me!
<SYNC Start=745086><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=753762 End=755027><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, there you are.
<SYNC Start=755063 End=756762><P Class=ZHCC>
All right,<br>i got the goods-
<SYNC Start=756798 End=758532><P Class=ZHCC>
Some candy bars, a few donuts<br>and some beef gravy.
<SYNC Start=758568 End=760233><P Class=ZHCC>
Is anyone starting to<br>suspect anything?
<SYNC Start=760269 End=762436><P Class=ZHCC>
Nobody, your mom even thinks<br>i'm a skinny you.
<SYNC Start=762472 End=763269><P Class=ZHCC>
Awesome.
<SYNC Start=763305 End=764171><P Class=ZHCC>
All right,<br>throw it over.
<SYNC Start=764606 End=765906><P Class=ZHCC>
I want a bigger cut.
<SYNC Start=766341 End=767607><P Class=ZHCC>
What?!<br>Risking my ass,
<SYNC Start=767643 End=768509><P Class=ZHCC>
Running around in that stupid<br>town pretending to be you
<SYNC Start=768944 End=770244><P Class=ZHCC>
And collecting all the food<br>to bring up here.
<SYNC Start=770679 End=771979><P Class=ZHCC>
All you have to do is sit back<br>and sell it to all the fat kids!
<SYNC Start=772414 End=773281><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, all right,<br>keep your voice down!
<SYNC Start=773715 End=775232><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll bump you up<br>to 10%.
<SYNC Start=775268 End=776716><P Class=ZHCC>
20.<br>Suck my balls, 20!
<SYNC Start=776752 End=778052><P Class=ZHCC>
Fine, then i shall<br>bid you good day.
<SYNC Start=778088 End=779787><P Class=ZHCC>
Wait, wait, wait-<br>Fine, 20.
<SYNC Start=780222 End=782823><P Class=ZHCC>
But just remember that your parents think<br>you're at the drug rehab center next door.
<SYNC Start=782859 End=785426><P Class=ZHCC>
You blow your cover<br>and we're both screwed.
<SYNC Start=785426><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=789097 End=791030><P Class=ZHCC>
You guys, you have to<br>check this tape out!
<SYNC Start=791066 End=792800><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, we're trying to study,<br>finals are tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=793235 End=794500><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=798006 End=799272><P Class=ZHCC>
Check it out!
<SYNC Start=799308 End=801475><P Class=ZHCC>
He jumped into a port-A-Potty<br>at a construction site
<SYNC Start=801511 End=803210><P Class=ZHCC>
And stayed there<br>for four days!
<SYNC Start=803645 End=804512><P Class=ZHCC>
Whoa!
<SYNC Start=804512><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=807983 End=809083><P Class=ZHCC>
Eww!
<SYNC Start=809284 End=810367><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=820562 End=823164><P Class=ZHCC>
The kid who will do<br>anything to himself for money...
<SYNC Start=823598 End=827501><P Class=ZHCC>
Kraaaazy kenny!
<SYNC Start=827936 End=830104><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny, through the past weeks,<br>we've seen you eat mice,
<SYNC Start=830539 End=832707><P Class=ZHCC>
Pretend to kill newborn babies<br>to shock their mothers
<SYNC Start=832743 End=834459><P Class=ZHCC>
And wash your hair<br>with battery acid.
<SYNC Start=834495 End=836177><P Class=ZHCC>
The question on<br>all our minds is,
<SYNC Start=836213 End=839213><P Class=ZHCC>
What are you<br>gonna do next?
<SYNC Start=839213><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=841817 End=843949><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, ho ho!<br>You heard him, folks.
<SYNC Start=843985 End=847021><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny is going to give<br>a sensual full-Body massage
<SYNC Start=847456 End=849623><P Class=ZHCC>
To his own grandfather.
<SYNC Start=850058 End=851359><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh ho!<br>Woo-Hoo!
<SYNC Start=851359><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=863071 End=865022><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh! Oh!
<SYNC Start=865058 End=866939><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh!<br>Oh!
<SYNC Start=866975 End=868709><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, this is kenny's<br>best show ever!
<SYNC Start=868745 End=869975><P Class=ZHCC>
This is so juvenile.
<SYNC Start=870011 End=871746><P Class=ZHCC>
Cartman, what the hell's<br>the matter with you?
<SYNC Start=872180 End=873481><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, you've gotten lame since<br>you got skinny, what's up?
<SYNC Start=873517 End=874747><P Class=ZHCC>
Nothing.
<SYNC Start=874783 End=877385><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, can i have some of<br>that licorice to take home?
<SYNC Start=877421 End=879518><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, campers,<br>good work today.
<SYNC Start=879554 End=884325><P Class=ZHCC>
Lights out and we'll see you tomorrow<br>for more exercise and proper diet.
<SYNC Start=884760 End=886277><P Class=ZHCC>
All "beddy-Byes" for<br>the night, are they?
<SYNC Start=886313 End=887795><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't know what<br>we're doing wrong, susan,
<SYNC Start=887831 End=889547><P Class=ZHCC>
These kids aren't<br>losing the weight.
<SYNC Start=889583 End=891265><P Class=ZHCC>
We'll just have to<br>give them more time.
<SYNC Start=891700 End=892566><P Class=ZHCC>
They'll do it.
<SYNC Start=892602 End=895568><P Class=ZHCC>
They'll do it!
<SYNC Start=895604 End=898205><P Class=ZHCC>
All right,<br>they're gone.
<SYNC Start=898205><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=899941 End=903376><P Class=ZHCC>
The cartman store<br>is open!
<SYNC Start=903412 End=906013><P Class=ZHCC>
Two donuts and a pack<br>of licorice, please.
<SYNC Start=906049 End=908616><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=1018793 End=1019660><P Class=ZHCC>
And down<br>to the ground.
<SYNC Start=1019696 End=1020926><P Class=ZHCC>
Ehh. Ehh.
<SYNC Start=1020962 End=1021829><P Class=ZHCC>
And up to the sky!
<SYNC Start=1021865 End=1023529><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah! Ah!
<SYNC Start=1023565 End=1025082><P Class=ZHCC>
And down<br>to the ground.
<SYNC Start=1025118 End=1026726><P Class=ZHCC>
Please,<br>mr. Sanders-
<SYNC Start=1026762 End=1027982><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=1028018 End=1029168><P Class=ZHCC>
What's<br>happening?
<SYNC Start=1029204 End=1030938><P Class=ZHCC>
Horace's parents want<br>to take him home.
<SYNC Start=1030974 End=1032204><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, but he's not<br>ready yet.
<SYNC Start=1032240 End=1033939><P Class=ZHCC>
Look at what you've<br>done to my boy!
<SYNC Start=1033975 End=1036976><P Class=ZHCC>
You told horace that he was<br>responsible for his weight.
<SYNC Start=1037012 End=1040047><P Class=ZHCC>
You made him believe that with exercise<br>and proper diet he could be thin.
<SYNC Start=1040083 End=1042416><P Class=ZHCC>
When we told you that<br>it was his genetics.
<SYNC Start=1042651 End=1044350><P Class=ZHCC>
They can lose the weight<br>if they try.
<SYNC Start=1044386 End=1046554><P Class=ZHCC>
Look at these, kids, they're<br>not getting any thinner!
<SYNC Start=1046590 End=1048254><P Class=ZHCC>
Your camp is a fraud.
<SYNC Start=1048290 End=1051759><P Class=ZHCC>
You need to accept the fact that most<br>fat people are just genetically fat.
<SYNC Start=1051795 End=1054361><P Class=ZHCC>
Please, sir, if you<br>give us one more week-
<SYNC Start=1054397 End=1055229><P Class=ZHCC>
Your time is up!
<SYNC Start=1055664 End=1056530><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, your time is up.
<SYNC Start=1056965 End=1058699><P Class=ZHCC>
And i'm going to call<br>all the other parents
<SYNC Start=1058735 End=1060434><P Class=ZHCC>
And tell them to come<br>claim their kids as well.
<SYNC Start=1060470 End=1062603><P Class=ZHCC>
Your camp was<br>a waste of time!
<SYNC Start=1062639 End=1065205><P Class=ZHCC>
But dad, i-<br>What?
<SYNC Start=1065241 End=1067808><P Class=ZHCC>
Nothin'.
<SYNC Start=1068243 End=1069977><P Class=ZHCC>
We're in trouble, rick.
<SYNC Start=1069977><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1071713 End=1073881><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, miss crabtree,<br>is it comfortable enough?
<SYNC Start=1073917 End=1075616><P Class=ZHCC>
How long have i<br>gotta sit here?
<SYNC Start=1075652 End=1076882><P Class=ZHCC>
Six hours.
<SYNC Start=1076918 End=1080387><P Class=ZHCC>
Hell, i'll do six hours for<br>the 500 bucks you're paying me.
<SYNC Start=1080423 End=1082122><P Class=ZHCC>
Great.<br>You guys, it's kenny!
<SYNC Start=1082557 End=1083857><P Class=ZHCC>
He's been arrested for<br>prostitution in new york.
<SYNC Start=1083893 End=1085124><P Class=ZHCC>
For what?
<SYNC Start=1085160 End=1086677><P Class=ZHCC>
For giving howard stern<br>a hummer.
<SYNC Start=1086713 End=1088160><P Class=ZHCC>
What's a hummer?<br>I don't know!
<SYNC Start=1088196 End=1090364><P Class=ZHCC>
All i know is kenny's in jail<br>for at least three months.
<SYNC Start=1090400 End=1092099><P Class=ZHCC>
Three months, but the<br>pay-Per-View is tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=1092135 End=1093834><P Class=ZHCC>
I know!
<SYNC Start=1093834><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1096004 End=1098137><P Class=ZHCC>
We've worked so hard,<br>come so close.
<SYNC Start=1098173 End=1100774><P Class=ZHCC>
Now we'll never see kenny crawl<br>up into miss crabtree's uterus.
<SYNC Start=1100810 End=1102943><P Class=ZHCC>
Y'know, maybe we've all<br>learned something here.
<SYNC Start=1103378 End=1105980><P Class=ZHCC>
I mean, we set kenny up to further<br>and further himself each time,
<SYNC Start=1106414 End=1107931><P Class=ZHCC>
Having to always<br>outdo himself.
<SYNC Start=1107967 End=1109450><P Class=ZHCC>
Now he's in jail<br>for being a whore.
<SYNC Start=1109884 End=1113787><P Class=ZHCC>
And perhaps, just perhaps,<br>we are to blame.
<SYNC Start=1113823 End=1115089><P Class=ZHCC>
All right,<br>that does it.
<SYNC Start=1115523 End=1117691><P Class=ZHCC>
This has been bothering<br>the hell out of me.
<SYNC Start=1118126 End=1119860><P Class=ZHCC>
I knew it, you're not<br>cartman at all!
<SYNC Start=1120295 End=1121161><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh-Oh.
<SYNC Start=1121161><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1125934 End=1128535><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, we've seen him do just about<br>every disgusting thing in the book.
<SYNC Start=1128970 End=1130235><P Class=ZHCC>
And today,<br>live on pay-Per-View,
<SYNC Start=1130271 End=1133741><P Class=ZHCC>
Krazy kenny is going to crawl<br>into a woman's uterus
<SYNC Start=1133777 End=1136308><P Class=ZHCC>
For six hours!
<SYNC Start=1136344 End=1138946><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, miss crabtree,<br>your cervix has been dilated,
<SYNC Start=1138982 End=1140681><P Class=ZHCC>
Your womb equipped<br>with oxygen-
<SYNC Start=1140717 End=1141783><P Class=ZHCC>
How do you feel?
<SYNC Start=1141819 End=1142850><P Class=ZHCC>
I feel great.
<SYNC Start=1143284 End=1146320><P Class=ZHCC>
I haven't had this much attention<br>paid to my cooch since i was 16!
<SYNC Start=1146356 End=1147621><P Class=ZHCC>
Hooray!
<SYNC Start=1148056 End=1149790><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, let's bring out<br>the man of the hour.

No way,<br>i'm not doing this.
<SYNC Start=1154164 End=1155394><P Class=ZHCC>

Or else we're gonna bust your<br>whole scheme wide open
<SYNC Start=1157599 End=1159767><P Class=ZHCC>
And tell your mom you haven't actually<br>been at your drug rehab this whole time.
<SYNC Start=1159803 End=1161201><P Class=ZHCC>
But this isn't fair!
<SYNC Start=1161237 End=1162369><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=1175418 End=1177551><P Class=ZHCC>
How are you doing<br>in there, kenny?
<SYNC Start=1177986 End=1179720><P Class=ZHCC>
That's my boy.

Hmm?
<SYNC Start=1195770 End=1198371><P Class=ZHCC>
It's time for me to be<br>responsible for my own actions.
<SYNC Start=1198407 End=1200974><P Class=ZHCC>
Mom, dad, we've been eating<br>candy this whole time.
