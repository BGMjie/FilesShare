Dude, where is she? We can't wait.
<SYNC Start=41734 End=43527><P Class=ZHCC>
God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
<SYNC Start=43653 End=47447><P Class=ZHCC>
Stan, you said your mom was bringing<br>KFC home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
<SYNC Start=47657 End=48532><P Class=ZHCC>
Hi boys.
<SYNC Start=48699 End=49825><P Class=ZHCC>
- Mom!<br>- She's here!
<SYNC Start=49867 End=50992><P Class=ZHCC>
She's got Colonel!
<SYNC Start=51035 End=52285><P Class=ZHCC>
- I want some!<br>- I want a breast!
<SYNC Start=52286 End=54079><P Class=ZHCC>
Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?
<SYNC Start=54122 End=55469><P Class=ZHCC>
Uuh uh uh, not so fast.
<SYNC Start=55470 End=58792><P Class=ZHCC>
You boys can help bring in the other groceries<br> in the car, then have your chicken.
<SYNC Start=58792><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=59585 End=61169><P Class=ZHCC>
But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!
<SYNC Start=61212 End=62671><P Class=ZHCC>
It won't take a minute.
<SYNC Start=62671><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=63589 End=66425><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on guys. If we all help out,<br> we can do it super-fast.
<SYNC Start=66509 End=67968><P Class=ZHCC>
- All right.<br>- Let's go.
<SYNC Start=68010 End=69678><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God, that smells good.
<SYNC Start=69678><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=81065 End=82524><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, this is everything, mom.
<SYNC Start=82524><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=84694 End=85944><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, let's eat Colonel!
<SYNC Start=86070 End=86903><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh boy!
<SYNC Start=86903><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=90992 End=93702><P Class=ZHCC>
Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
<SYNC Start=93786 End=95287><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, I saved you all the chicken part.
<SYNC Start=95621 End=97080><P Class=ZHCC>
The skin's the best part...
<SYNC Start=97123 End=100000><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, I gotta go home, guys.<br>I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books.
<SYNC Start=100042 End=101293><P Class=ZHCC>
See you at the bus stop tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=101293><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=112346 End=113805><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't believe that fat asshole!
<SYNC Start=113848 End=116016><P Class=ZHCC>
You can't believe it??<br> He does this shit all the time!
<SYNC Start=116058 End=117517><P Class=ZHCC>
Well this time he's gone too far.
<SYNC Start=117517><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=118644 End=120145><P Class=ZHCC>
Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
<SYNC Start=120229 End=122439><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
<SYNC Start=122482 End=124941><P Class=ZHCC>
Well it's not like we're nice to him.<br> I mean, we rip on him all the time!
<SYNC Start=124984 End=126651><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, but he thrives on that.
<SYNC Start=126694 End=128153><P Class=ZHCC>
All right. Then let's just ignore him.
<SYNC Start=128196 End=131073><P Class=ZHCC>
From now on, let's not talk to him,<br> let's not even acknowledge him.
<SYNC Start=131073><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=131824 End=132866><P Class=ZHCC>
That sounds great!
<SYNC Start=132866><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=133409 End=134951><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey fags, what's going on?
<SYNC Start=134951><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=139373 End=142751><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, I was on the toilet all night from<br> that chicken. I thought I was gonna die.
<SYNC Start=142751><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=144003 End=145504><P Class=ZHCC>
Do any of you guys have<br> milk money I can borrow?
<SYNC Start=145546 End=146505><P Class=ZHCC>
I think I have extra.
<SYNC Start=146547 End=149007><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh wow, a Jew asking for money!<br>There's a new one.
<SYNC Start=149007><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=150968 End=153136><P Class=ZHCC>
Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
<SYNC Start=153179 End=154429><P Class=ZHCC>
- Here you go.<br>- Thanks.
<SYNC Start=154429><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=155389 End=157849><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, Stan, yuh you know why<br> Jews have glassy eyes?
<SYNC Start=158101 End=158934><P Class=ZHCC>
Like Kyle?
<SYNC Start=158934><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=160520 End=163563><P Class=ZHCC>
K-Kenny, you see that chick on<br> the news that had her left titty cut off?
<SYNC Start=163648 End=164523><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny...?
<SYNC Start=164941 End=165732><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny!?
<SYNC Start=165732><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=168986 End=170946><P Class=ZHCC>
Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric!
<SYNC Start=171364 End=173865><P Class=ZHCC>
Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?
<SYNC Start=173865><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=174951 End=176701><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!
<SYNC Start=176701><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=183000 End=183625><P Class=ZHCC>
Wha...?
<SYNC Start=184085 End=184918><P Class=ZHCC>
How did...?
<SYNC Start=184918><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=185628 End=187796><P Class=ZHCC>
Like they couldn't see or hear me.
<SYNC Start=187796><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=188548 End=190215><P Class=ZHCC>
It's almost as if I were...
<SYNC Start=190215><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=192260 End=193301><P Class=ZHCC>
dead.
<SYNC Start=193301><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=194220 End=194845><P Class=ZHCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=195304 End=196471><P Class=ZHCC>
No, I can't be dead.
<SYNC Start=196597 End=198056><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't be dead!!
<SYNC Start=198056><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=199308 End=202769><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed <br>and we'll haul away the old one away for ya.
<SYNC Start=202812 End=206106><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh,<br>just don't know how to thank you.
<SYNC Start=206106><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=206816 End=208483><P Class=ZHCC>
I could think of a few ways.
<SYNC Start=208483><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=214866 End=215365><P Class=ZHCC>
No!
<SYNC Start=215658 End=216491><P Class=ZHCC>
Noooo!!!
<SYNC Start=216909 End=218368><P Class=ZHCC>
What happened? Did they say?
<SYNC Start=218619 End=223415><P Class=ZHCC>
Apparently there was so much chicken skin<br> in the system it just ruptured the insides.
<SYNC Start=223499 End=225167><P Class=ZHCC>
Aww, that's tragic.
<SYNC Start=225167><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=225793 End=227746><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God, this can't be happening!
<SYNC Start=227746><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=230465 End=233096><P Class=ZHCC>
Mom? Mom's crying?<br>Oh God, it is true!
<SYNC Start=233096><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=241559 End=242809><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, it's not fair!
<SYNC Start=242977 End=243852><P Class=ZHCC>
Why???
<SYNC Start=243895 End=244936><P Class=ZHCC>
WHY???
<SYNC Start=244936><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=251068 End=252944><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman?
<SYNC Start=253237 End=254488><P Class=ZHCC>
Cartman isn't our friend anymor
<SYNC Start=254572 End=255614><P Class=ZHCC>
We're ignoring him.
<SYNC Start=256032 End=257365><P Class=ZHCC>
Ignoring him? How come?
<SYNC Start=257408 End=260410><P Class=ZHCC>
Beause he's a fat racist self-centered <br>intolerant manipulating sociopath!
<SYNC Start=260745 End=261369><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh yeah.
<SYNC Start=261412 End=263580><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, I hate Cartman <br>Can I ignore him with you?
<SYNC Start=263623 End=265499><P Class=ZHCC>
- Yeah.<br>- Me too. - Yeah, screw him! Yeah.
<SYNC Start=265583 End=267667><P Class=ZHCC>
I never realized ignoring him was an option.
<SYNC Start=268127 End=270003><P Class=ZHCC>
Guys! Guys?
<SYNC Start=270296 End=271505><P Class=ZHCC>
Can anybody hear me?
<SYNC Start=271547 End=272380><P Class=ZHCC>
You guys??
<SYNC Start=272465 End=274174><P Class=ZHCC>
Token, Token, I'm here!
<SYNC Start=274592 End=276676><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello! Hello! Hello!
<SYNC Start=276886 End=279805><P Class=ZHCC>
Clyde, can't you feel me?<br>Feel me, Clyde!
<SYNC Start=279805><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=280389 End=282474><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!
<SYNC Start=282474><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=283935 End=286937><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy! Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!
<SYNC Start=286937><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=288231 End=291569><P Class=ZHCC>
They don't even know yet,<br>that one of their best friends is dead.
<SYNC Start=291569><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=292193 End=294991><P Class=ZHCC>
Dead and... still wandering<br> the earth a lost soul.
<SYNC Start=294991><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=307542 End=308959><P Class=ZHCC>
What is that kid doing?
<SYNC Start=309293 End=310961><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't know, just ignore him.
<SYNC Start=310961><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=325226 End=327185><P Class=ZHCC>
Lu lu lu, I've got some apples.
<SYNC Start=327228 End=328645><P Class=ZHCC>
Lu lu lu, yuu've got some too-
<SYNC Start=328688 End=330147><P Class=ZHCC>
What did I do to deserve this?!
<SYNC Start=330273 End=332065><P Class=ZHCC>
How can my own God forsake me?!
<SYNC Start=332065><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=332692 End=335193><P Class=ZHCC>
Am I doomed to wander<br> the Earth alone for all eternity?!
<SYNC Start=335653 End=336653><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey Eric!
<SYNC Start=336653><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=339574 End=340615><P Class=ZHCC>
...What did you say?
<SYNC Start=340615><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=342118 End=343785><P Class=ZHCC>
Huh I just said, "Hey Eric!"
<SYNC Start=343785><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=344328 End=345162><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters...
<SYNC Start=345162><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=345913 End=346955><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters! You can see me??
<SYNC Start=347039 End=348498><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, sure I can see you.
<SYNC Start=348666 End=350250><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God, and you can hear me??
<SYNC Start=350293 End=353420><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
<SYNC Start=353713 End=354629><P Class=ZHCC>
Because, Butters,
<SYNC Start=354629><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=355256 End=356631><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm... dead.
<SYNC Start=356631><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=360595 End=361219><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters!
<SYNC Start=361637 End=362888><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, I just want to talk to you!
<SYNC Start=363347 End=365140><P Class=ZHCC>
You died?? How??
<SYNC Start=365183 End=367476><P Class=ZHCC>
I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
<SYNC Start=367769 End=369853><P Class=ZHCC>
But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?
<SYNC Start=369896 End=371521><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
<SYNC Start=371521><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=375610 End=377694><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters! Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
<SYNC Start=377694><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=383326 End=385202><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, what on earth are you doing??
<SYNC Start=385244 End=388705><P Class=ZHCC>
Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie!<br> I-I'm seeing dead people!
<SYNC Start=388748 End=389790><P Class=ZHCC>
Dead people?
<SYNC Start=390166 End=391416><P Class=ZHCC>
Who's seeing dead people?
<SYNC Start=391584 End=393384><P Class=ZHCC>
Me! I saw a ghost!
<SYNC Start=393384><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=394128 End=397047><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.
<SYNC Start=397131 End=399841><P Class=ZHCC>
But I saw him!<br> Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
<SYNC Start=399884 End=402135><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, these things happen all the time.
<SYNC Start=402178 End=405722><P Class=ZHCC>
You've got a very active little brain <br>and your mind was just playing tricks on you.
<SYNC Start=405848 End=406890><P Class=ZHCC>
Ruh, really?
<SYNC Start=407100 End=407933><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeess.
<SYNC Start=408309 End=408725><P Class=ZHCC>
So...
<SYNC Start=409185 End=412395><P Class=ZHCC>
so it was just... it was...<br>just my ima... magination then?
<SYNC Start=412438 End=413355><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right.
<SYNC Start=413481 End=416483><P Class=ZHCC>
There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real.
<SYNC Start=416651 End=420167><P Class=ZHCC>
There's plenty of real things to be scared of.<br>Like super-AIDS.
<SYNC Start=420655 End=421905><P Class=ZHCC>
Huh s-s-super-AIDS?
<SYNC Start=421948 End=424866><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right. A new form of AIDS<br> which is resistant to drugs.
<SYNC Start=424909 End=428036><P Class=ZHCC>
Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt <br>and you're dead in three years.
<SYNC Start=428036><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=428830 End=429663><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh Jesus.
<SYNC Start=429831 End=433687><P Class=ZHCC>
So now you feel better?<br>Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of.
<SYNC Start=434001 End=435460><P Class=ZHCC>
Except the super-AIDS.
<SYNC Start=435460><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=443511 End=446763><P Class=ZHCC>
Nuh-nothing to be scared of. <br>Jus, just some lightning and thunder.
<SYNC Start=446763><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=449142 End=450225><P Class=ZHCC>
Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither.
<SYNC Start=450393 End=451435><P Class=ZHCC>
J-just a muhouse.
<SYNC Start=451435><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=452353 End=452978><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters...
<SYNC Start=452978><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=455273 End=456565><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, you have to help me!
<SYNC Start=456732 End=458191><P Class=ZHCC>
Go away! You aren't real!
<SYNC Start=458401 End=459860><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.
<SYNC Start=459860><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=465533 End=466992><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, what is going on?!
<SYNC Start=467118 End=468785><P Class=ZHCC>
Well it's all.. Well he was...
<SYNC Start=468785><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=469704 End=470454><P Class=ZHCC>
Nothin'
<SYNC Start=470705 End=471872><P Class=ZHCC>
I I just had a nightmare.
<SYNC Start=471914 End=474624><P Class=ZHCC>
Well you'd better stop having nightmares<br> or eles you're gonna be grounded!
<SYNC Start=474709 End=475959><P Class=ZHCC>
Y yes, yes sir.
<SYNC Start=475959><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=483217 End=483842><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters!
<SYNC Start=483842><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=486596 End=488305><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination!
<SYNC Start=488347 End=489848><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
<SYNC Start=489932 End=491141><P Class=ZHCC>
But I don't want to see you!
<SYNC Start=491184 End=493059><P Class=ZHCC>
Get a hold of yourself!<br> I'm the one who died!
<SYNC Start=493059><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=493728 End=496313><P Class=ZHCC>
And for some reason, <br>my spirit is trapped here on Earth.
<SYNC Start=496481 End=498064><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't find the passage to Heaven.
<SYNC Start=498064><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=499066 End=502069><P Class=ZHCC>
Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
<SYNC Start=502153 End=502986><P Class=ZHCC>
What do you mean?
<SYNC Start=503279 End=506782><P Class=ZHCC>
Well... how do you know you're<br> not supposed to go to... you know...
<SYNC Start=506782><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=507408 End=508241><P Class=ZHCC>
Heck.
<SYNC Start=508241><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=509160 End=511495><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm not going to Heck, Butters!<br> I'm not black, all right?!
<SYNC Start=511495><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=512455 End=513205><P Class=ZHCC>
Now look:
<SYNC Start=513456 End=517501><P Class=ZHCC>
I think the reason my soul is still here is because<br>I need closure with all my friends and loved one.
<SYNC Start=517668 End=520420><P Class=ZHCC>
I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
<SYNC Start=520420><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=521255 End=522005><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't.
<SYNC Start=522048 End=523173><P Class=ZHCC>
Ahah I have school tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=523173><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=523716 End=524800><P Class=ZHCC>
This is your problem, Butters!
<SYNC Start=524842 End=527344><P Class=ZHCC>
Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!
<SYNC Start=527344><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=530389 End=531014><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh all right.
<SYNC Start=531014><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=531724 End=532766><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, I'll help you!
<SYNC Start=532766><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=540691 End=541608><P Class=ZHCC>
- Mrs. Cartman?<br>- Yes? Oh hi.
<SYNC Start=541608><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=544112 End=547197><P Class=ZHCC>
This is going to seem very strange and,<br> and you may not believe me,
<SYNC Start=547532 End=550492><P Class=ZHCC>
but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
<SYNC Start=550492><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=551202 End=552577><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, what is it?
<SYNC Start=552745 End=554788><P Class=ZHCC>
Tell her, tell her that I love her.
<SYNC Start=554831 End=556665><P Class=ZHCC>
He says, he love you.
<SYNC Start=556665><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=559627 End=561503><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, that's so nice.
<SYNC Start=561503><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=562380 End=564005><P Class=ZHCC>
Tell her, tell her that I wish...
<SYNC Start=564424 End=565924><P Class=ZHCC>
I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
<SYNC Start=565967 End=567774><P Class=ZHCC>
He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
<SYNC Start=567775 End=570804><P Class=ZHCC>
It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with <br>the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes...
<SYNC Start=570847 End=572514><P Class=ZHCC>
took my family for granted!
<SYNC Start=572557 End=576226><P Class=ZHCC>
He he got caught, he got caught up in<br> the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
<SYNC Start=576226><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=576769 End=581087><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, that's so sweet.<br>Oh, I love you too, poopiekins!
<SYNC Start=581087><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=593661 End=596872><P Class=ZHCC>
Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry
<SYNC Start=596914 End=598957><P Class=ZHCC>
for all the times he made fun of<br> you being a no-good stinking Jew.
<SYNC Start=598957><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=603004 End=607090><P Class=ZHCC>
He's asking for your forgiveness.<br> And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
<SYNC Start=607133 End=608175><P Class=ZHCC>
Just the good times.
<SYNC Start=608175><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=609010 End=610677><P Class=ZHCC>
There were no good times!
<SYNC Start=610720 End=613138><P Class=ZHCC>
And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
<SYNC Start=613264 End=614890><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't! Don't you understand?!
<SYNC Start=614932 End=616808><P Class=ZHCC>
He can't! Don't you understand?!
<SYNC Start=616851 End=618894><P Class=ZHCC>
God forgave the Jews, <br>you should be able to forgive me!
<SYNC Start=618936 End=621605><P Class=ZHCC>
God forgave the Jews, <br>you should be able to forgive him!
<SYNC Start=621605><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=622273 End=623148><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, come on, Butters,
<SYNC Start=623191 End=625358><P Class=ZHCC>
we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry <br>for rippin' on him for bein' black.
<SYNC Start=625777 End=627069><P Class=ZHCC>
Uhh all right then.
<SYNC Start=627069><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=630698 End=631573><P Class=ZHCC>
Who was that?
<SYNC Start=631573><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=632450 End=635035><P Class=ZHCC>
It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
<SYNC Start=635035><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=635620 End=636787><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, he did that to me this morning.
<SYNC Start=636787><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=637497 End=639414><P Class=ZHCC>
He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone,
<SYNC Start=639457 End=641041><P Class=ZHCC>
we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
<SYNC Start=641041><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=642293 End=643794><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, we know better than to think that.
<SYNC Start=643794><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=644545 End=647756><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, that takes care of Token,<br> Clyde, and Mr. Kitty.
<SYNC Start=647756><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=648841 End=649883><P Class=ZHCC>
That's eveyone, I guess.
<SYNC Start=649883><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=650510 End=652094><P Class=ZHCC>
All that leaves is you, Butters.
<SYNC Start=652094><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=653721 End=656431><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
<SYNC Start=656431><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=657016 End=658683><P Class=ZHCC>
Aww, that's okay, Eric.
<SYNC Start=658683><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=660895 End=662145><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, it's all done.
<SYNC Start=662230 End=663313><P Class=ZHCC>
My soul is at peace.
<SYNC Start=663564 End=665065><P Class=ZHCC>
I think... I can go now.
<SYNC Start=665108 End=666566><P Class=ZHCC>
So I won't see you again?
<SYNC Start=666609 End=667859><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't be sad, Butters.
<SYNC Start=667902 End=670904><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person <br>in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest,
<SYNC Start=670947 End=672823><P Class=ZHCC>
and ten thousand dollars cash.
<SYNC Start=672823><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=675243 End=677863><P Class=ZHCC>
G'bye Butters.<br>I'm goin' to a better place.
<SYNC Start=678246 End=679913><P Class=ZHCC>
Perhaps I'll see you again sometime!
<SYNC Start=680081 End=681581><P Class=ZHCC>
Good-bye!!
<SYNC Start=681581><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=687880 End=689131><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeh you're still here.
<SYNC Start=689131><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=690091 End=691967><P Class=ZHCC>
Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
<SYNC Start=691967><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=692635 End=694553><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
<SYNC Start=694595 End=696012><P Class=ZHCC>
What else do I have to do?!
<SYNC Start=696012><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=696597 End=697747><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, well, you know,
<SYNC Start=697748 End=700058><P Class=ZHCC>
the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace,
<SYNC Start=700101 End=702727><P Class=ZHCC>
sometimes, you have to atone <br>for something bad you did.
<SYNC Start=702812 End=703645><P Class=ZHCC>
Atone?
<SYNC Start=703688 End=705313><P Class=ZHCC>
Did you ever do anything really bad?
<SYNC Start=705313><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=706774 End=708108><P Class=ZHCC>
Not really...
<SYNC Start=708108><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=709610 End=713196><P Class=ZHCC>
Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's<br> fence and never told him about it.
<SYNC Start=713281 End=714823><P Class=ZHCC>
Broke fence...
<SYNC Start=714866 End=716825><P Class=ZHCC>
took a crap in the principal's purse...
<SYNC Start=717076 End=718201><P Class=ZHCC>
seven times.
<SYNC Start=718201><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=718953 End=722956><P Class=ZHCC>
Then there was the time I convinced a woman<br> to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza.
<SYNC Start=722956><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=723708 End=726293><P Class=ZHCC>
I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics.
<SYNC Start=726293><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=726961 End=729588><P Class=ZHCC>
I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring.
<SYNC Start=729588><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=730298 End=731506><P Class=ZHCC>
Uuh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed
<SYNC Start=731506><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=732884 End=735010><P Class=ZHCC>
and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
<SYNC Start=735010><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=736596 End=739264><P Class=ZHCC>
Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
<SYNC Start=739307 End=739931><P Class=ZHCC>
Really?
<SYNC Start=739974 End=740640><P Class=ZHCC>
Really.
<SYNC Start=740725 End=743560><P Class=ZHCC>
I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
<SYNC Start=743560><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=745021 End=746062><P Class=ZHCC>
I know how.
<SYNC Start=746062><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=752612 End=755322><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm gonna make, make it right.
<SYNC Start=755364 End=758408><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.
<SYNC Start=758576 End=761119><P Class=ZHCC>
Make, make it right.
<SYNC Start=761162 End=764039><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
<SYNC Start=764082 End=766625><P Class=ZHCC>
It feels so good to be making up
<SYNC Start=766834 End=769461><P Class=ZHCC>
For all the things I've done wrong.
<SYNC Start=769545 End=772205><P Class=ZHCC>
I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven
<SYNC Start=772616 End=775321><P Class=ZHCC>
Wanted from me all along.
<SYNC Start=775322 End=779137><P Class=ZHCC>
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.
<SYNC Start=779180 End=781765><P Class=ZHCC>
'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.
<SYNC Start=781808 End=784518><P Class=ZHCC>
Not faking it, I'm making it right.
<SYNC Start=784769 End=787270><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
<SYNC Start=787480 End=792948><P Class=ZHCC>
Make, make it right!<br>Make, make it right!
<SYNC Start=793111 End=797697><P Class=ZHCC>
Gonna make it right, girl,<br>I've got to have your lovin' tonight!
<SYNC Start=797697><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=804247 End=805914><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, there's everything, Butters.
<SYNC Start=805914><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=806457 End=807916><P Class=ZHCC>
I've made everything right.
<SYNC Start=807916><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=808501 End=810961><P Class=ZHCC>
Does this mean... you have to go now?
<SYNC Start=810961><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=811587 End=813672><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace.
<SYNC Start=813881 End=815215><P Class=ZHCC>
It's time for me to leave.
<SYNC Start=815215><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=815967 End=816842><P Class=ZHCC>
Goodbye Butters!
<SYNC Start=816968 End=818176><P Class=ZHCC>
Thanks for all your help!
<SYNC Start=818511 End=819719><P Class=ZHCC>
Be good and be safe. Goodbye...
<SYNC Start=819719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=825351 End=826560><P Class=ZHCC>
Goddamnit, what?!
<SYNC Start=826769 End=828228><P Class=ZHCC>
I've made everything right!
<SYNC Start=828312 End=831982><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul<br> is stuck here for a different reason.
<SYNC Start=832108 End=835318><P Class=ZHCC>
I want my eternal bliss!<br>Do you think this is funny, God?!
<SYNC Start=835318><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=837947 End=839406><P Class=ZHCC>
Do you think this is funny,..?
<SYNC Start=839406><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=840032 End=841575><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric! Calm down.
<SYNC Start=841575><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=843578 End=845120><P Class=ZHCC>
Stupid butthole God!
<SYNC Start=845120><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=854630 End=856298><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters! What have you done?!
<SYNC Start=856340 End=858675><P Class=ZHCC>
Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
<SYNC Start=858718 End=861775><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should<br>ground him or call a doctor.
<SYNC Start=862013 End=863722><P Class=ZHCC>
No, I think you'd better call a doctor.
<SYNC Start=863765 End=864806><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll ground him.
<SYNC Start=864806><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=868644 End=869811><P Class=ZHCC>
What do you think, Doctor?
<SYNC Start=869854 End=872564><P Class=ZHCC>
Your son is suffering from severe dementia.
<SYNC Start=872774 End=875776><P Class=ZHCC>
He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him.
<SYNC Start=876110 End=880614><P Class=ZHCC>
This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought<br>on by some tragic event in the child's past.
<SYNC Start=880948 End=884159><P Class=ZHCC>
I think it's best that we take him<br>to the mental center and do some tests.
<SYNC Start=884327 End=886453><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh no.<br>NO!
<SYNC Start=886453><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=886996 End=888955><P Class=ZHCC>
INSTITUTE FOR MENTAL HEALTH
<SYNC Start=888955><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=894879 End=896755><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, Butters, just try to relax.
<SYNC Start=896755><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=905014 End=906264><P Class=ZHCC>
Doin' just fine, Butters.
<SYNC Start=906264><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=912271 End=914231><P Class=ZHCC>
Just stay perfectly still now, Butters.
<SYNC Start=914231><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=921447 End=923448><P Class=ZHCC>
Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters.
<SYNC Start=923448><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=927412 End=931028><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't worry, Mr. Stotch.<br>Whatever traumatized yoru son in his past, we'll find it.
<SYNC Start=931028><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=937130 End=939100><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, after fourteen hours of testing,
<SYNC Start=939125 End=943218><P Class=ZHCC>
I can say Butters is definitely suffering<br>from aggravated repressied memory syndrome.
<SYNC Start=943261 End=944094><P Class=ZHCC>
You see, Butters,
<SYNC Start=944137 End=948432><P Class=ZHCC>
when the brain wants to cover something up,<br>it makes up images and sounds for you to hear.
<SYNC Start=948683 End=951977><P Class=ZHCC>
So... the ghost was in my head.
<SYNC Start=952019 End=954642><P Class=ZHCC>
- The whole time.<br>- Now do you believe us, Butters?
<SYNC Start=954856 End=956815><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
<SYNC Start=956858 End=958525><P Class=ZHCC>
Good. We're making a lot of headway.
<SYNC Start=958568 End=960068><P Class=ZHCC>
We'll do some more testing tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=960403 End=962362><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest.
<SYNC Start=962447 End=963905><P Class=ZHCC>
Goodnight, baby
<SYNC Start=963905><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=968035 End=968660><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters!
<SYNC Start=968660><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=970872 End=972372><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't worry, Butters,<br>I'm gonna get you out of here.
<SYNC Start=972415 End=975250><P Class=ZHCC>
Please leave me alone, Eric.<br>My bottom is really sore.
<SYNC Start=975376 End=977461><P Class=ZHCC>
I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!
<SYNC Start=977920 End=981131><P Class=ZHCC>
Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal.<br>She can tell us what to do!
<SYNC Start=981174 End=984259><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head<br>brought on by a traumatic event.
<SYNC Start=984302 End=985802><P Class=ZHCC>
She's gonna close soon! Come on!
<SYNC Start=986262 End=988346><P Class=ZHCC>
Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
<SYNC Start=988346><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=999567 End=1001443><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?
<SYNC Start=1001778 End=1003445><P Class=ZHCC>
Certainly. Come in.
<SYNC Start=1003445><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1004530 End=1007324><P Class=ZHCC>
Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.
<SYNC Start=1007575 End=1009159><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, there's this ghost, see?
<SYNC Start=1009202 End=1012621><P Class=ZHCC>
Only it probably isn't a ghost,<br>ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma.
<SYNC Start=1012663 End=1015916><P Class=ZHCC>
Well I'm supposed to heh, help him,<br>find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth,
<SYNC Start=1015958 End=1018502><P Class=ZHCC>
even though I know that I'm most<br>likely just completely insane.
<SYNC Start=1018836 End=1021922><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, many times, the reason that<br>the sould stays Earth-bound is
<SYNC Start=1021964 End=1026384><P Class=ZHCC>
because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose,
<SYNC Start=1026427 End=1030055><P Class=ZHCC>
to help prevent an impending tragic event.
<SYNC Start=1030515 End=1034059><P Class=ZHCC>
Of course. That's it, Butters!<br>We had it wrong all the time!
<SYNC Start=1034059><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1034685 End=1039314><P Class=ZHCC>
But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy,<br>young man. I see ghosts all the time.
<SYNC Start=1039314><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1040024 End=1040649><P Class=ZHCC>
Really?
<SYNC Start=1040858 End=1043735><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?
<SYNC Start=1043820 End=1045862><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
<SYNC Start=1045862><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1052370 End=1055831><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, I think she could see you too.<br>You really are a ghost.
<SYNC Start=1055873 End=1056915><P Class=ZHCC>
I told you, Butters.
<SYNC Start=1057208 End=1058708><P Class=ZHCC>
This is breaking news!
<SYNC Start=1059168 End=1061753><P Class=ZHCC>
A tragic event is unfolding in South Park.
<SYNC Start=1062004 End=1067634><P Class=ZHCC>
Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail<br>and are holding twelve people at the Red Cross!
<SYNC Start=1067969 End=1072264><P Class=ZHCC>
Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested<br>when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me,
<SYNC Start=1072306 End=1074850><P Class=ZHCC>
and threatened to kill all the workers inside.
<SYNC Start=1075101 End=1078812><P Class=ZHCC>
The violent men are demanding a helicopter<br>and two hundred thousand dollars cash.
<SYNC Start=1078812><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1079897 End=1081231><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God, this is it, Butters.
<SYNC Start=1081482 End=1083775><P Class=ZHCC>
This is what I'm here to stop.<br>Come on, Butters.
<SYNC Start=1083818 End=1086695><P Class=ZHCC>
This psychic boy and his ghost pal<br>are going to save the day!
<SYNC Start=1086695><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Stay back, people!
<SYNC Start=1090742 End=1093076><P Class=ZHCC>
Stay back?!<br>Hell, my wife and child are in there!
<SYNC Start=1093076><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1093619 End=1096329><P Class=ZHCC>
Stay calm in there.<br>We don't want anybody getting hurt.
<SYNC Start=1096622 End=1101126><P Class=ZHCC>
You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars<br>or these people start dyin', man!
<SYNC Start=1101126><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1102253 End=1104212><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first.
<SYNC Start=1104255 End=1107257><P Class=ZHCC>
Give me thirty seconds in there,<br>and then you go in and free the hostiages.
<SYNC Start=1107300 End=1109468><P Class=ZHCC>
Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
<SYNC Start=1109635 End=1111178><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't worry. I have a plan.
<SYNC Start=1111178><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1111846 End=1112512><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric.
<SYNC Start=1112512><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1113848 End=1116141><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, be careful, ghost pal.
<SYNC Start=1116141><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1116934 End=1119144><P Class=ZHCC>
They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead.
<SYNC Start=1119144><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1124650 End=1126109><P Class=ZHCC>
What the hell is that kid doing?
<SYNC Start=1126109><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1126861 End=1128236><P Class=ZHCC>
Somebody's comin' in!
<SYNC Start=1128446 End=1130322><P Class=ZHCC>
It's just some little fat kid.
<SYNC Start=1130322><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1140875 End=1142375><P Class=ZHCC>
What the hell is going on?
<SYNC Start=1142585 End=1143960><P Class=ZHCC>
I have no idea.
<SYNC Start=1144087 End=1145128><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, it's working!
<SYNC Start=1145128><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1149342 End=1150675><P Class=ZHCC>
This is really weird.
<SYNC Start=1150675><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1160019 End=1161686><P Class=ZHCC>
An incredible development here, Tom.
<SYNC Start=1161729 End=1165357><P Class=ZHCC>
Two little boys have fearlessly<br>gone inside the Red Cross.
<SYNC Start=1165357><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1167193 End=1167859><P Class=ZHCC>
Cartman?
<SYNC Start=1167859><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1171155 End=1172781><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm so confused!
<SYNC Start=1172781><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1175259 End=1176587><P Class=ZHCC>
Hurry. Go, go!
<SYNC Start=1176587><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1180790 End=1182082><P Class=ZHCC>
The hostages are clear!
<SYNC Start=1182542 End=1183667><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, move in!
<SYNC Start=1183667><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1187839 End=1189256><P Class=ZHCC>
The hostages are gone!
<SYNC Start=1189590 End=1190340><P Class=ZHCC>
What?!
<SYNC Start=1190340><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1193469 End=1194845><P Class=ZHCC>
Son of a bitch.
<SYNC Start=1194845><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1195638 End=1197931><P Class=ZHCC>
Tom, an incredible story of courage.
<SYNC Start=1197974 End=1201226><P Class=ZHCC>
Two little boys, armed only with<br>the weapon of confusion,
<SYNC Start=1201269 End=1204062><P Class=ZHCC>
managed to go in and save the Red Cross.
<SYNC Start=1204230 End=1209609><P Class=ZHCC>
Nobody seems to know who the boys are<br>or where they went off to, but they are heroes.
<SYNC Start=1209609><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1211612 End=1214114><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, we did it, Butters.<br>We saved the day.
<SYNC Start=1214449 End=1216241><P Class=ZHCC>
Boy, we sure did.
<SYNC Start=1216241><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1217493 End=1218910><P Class=ZHCC>
My spirit is at rest now.
<SYNC Start=1219203 End=1221747><P Class=ZHCC>
I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest,
<SYNC Start=1221789 End=1223039><P Class=ZHCC>
and ten thousand dollars cash.
<SYNC Start=1223039><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1223624 End=1228211><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, I think that, through this whole thing,<br>we've really become friends.
<SYNC Start=1228211><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1228796 End=1230797><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
<SYNC Start=1230797><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1231591 End=1233258><P Class=ZHCC>
We both, kind of needed each other and..
<SYNC Start=1233258><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1233926 End=1236011><P Class=ZHCC>
well... I'm gonna miss you.
<SYNC Start=1236011><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1236804 End=1239139><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll miss you too, ghost pal.
<SYNC Start=1239139><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1240099 End=1242309><P Class=ZHCC>
Goodbye Buttters.<br>I must be going now.
<SYNC Start=1242393 End=1244019><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll be looking down on you from time to time.
<SYNC Start=1244019><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1244771 End=1246438><P Class=ZHCC>
Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters!
<SYNC Start=1246689 End=1248565><P Class=ZHCC>
Goodbyyye!
<SYNC Start=1248565><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1249776 End=1251818><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did.
<SYNC Start=1252028 End=1253945><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now.
<SYNC Start=1253945><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1260244 End=1262704><P Class=ZHCC>
We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist,<br>you would really change,
<SYNC Start=1262747 End=1263580><P Class=ZHCC>
but you really have.
<SYNC Start=1263580><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1265291 End=1267292><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know.
<SYNC Start=1267335 End=1268043><P Class=ZHCC>
Talk to you tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=1268169 End=1269419><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. S-see ya, Eric.
<SYNC Start=1269419><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1277553 End=1279554><P Class=ZHCC>
You sonofabitch Butters!
<SYNC Start=1279554><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1280765 End=1282015><P Class=ZHCC>
You told me I was a ghost!
<SYNC Start=1282141 End=1283308><P Class=ZHCC>
Huh but I thought you were one!
<SYNC Start=1283351 End=1284226><P Class=ZHCC>
How stupid are you?!
<SYNC Start=1284435 End=1287072><P Class=ZHCC>
How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters,<br>I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to
<SYNC Start=1287073 End=1288093><P Class=ZHCC>
GET YOU BACK!
<SYNC Start=1288093><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1291025 End=1291650><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters?!
<SYNC Start=1291650><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Oh Hamburgers.
