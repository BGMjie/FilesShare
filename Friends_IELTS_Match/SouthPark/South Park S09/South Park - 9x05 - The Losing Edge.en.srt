<SYNC Start=133389><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=136761 End=137427><P Class=ZHCC>
... What?
<SYNC Start=137637 End=140805><P Class=ZHCC>
Well we won! That means we've <br>got the best record in the division!
<SYNC Start=141015 End=143808><P Class=ZHCC>
Congratulations, boys!<br> You're goin' on to the post-season.
<SYNC Start=143808><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=144727 End=145519><P Class=ZHCC>
Post-season?
<SYNC Start=145561 End=147437><P Class=ZHCC>
Nobody said anything about a post-season.
<SYNC Start=147855 End=150607><P Class=ZHCC>
There's more little-league baseball for South Park!
<SYNC Start=150607><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=154987 End=155612><P Class=ZHCC>
No...
<SYNC Start=155612><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=156155 End=157322><P Class=ZHCC>
NOOO!!
<SYNC Start=157322><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

This is for what?! <br>Arresting me for what?!
<SYNC Start=160993 End=164704><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?!<br>I thought this was America!
<SYNC Start=164789 End=168375><P Class=ZHCC>
Huh?! Isn't this America!?<br>I'm sorry, I thought this was America!
<SYNC Start=168375><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=173339 End=174506><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't believe it.
<SYNC Start=174632 End=176550><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
<SYNC Start=176717 End=179427><P Class=ZHCC>
Nobody told us if we win too many <br>games we'd go on to the finals!
<SYNC Start=179427><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=180012 End=182055><P Class=ZHCC>
Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
<SYNC Start=182306 End=183348><P Class=ZHCC>
Not all that bad??
<SYNC Start=183391 End=186184><P Class=ZHCC>
How could you say that?!<br>You hate this game more than any of us!
<SYNC Start=186227 End=187269><P Class=ZHCC>
I know, but listen:
<SYNC Start=187353 End=189312><P Class=ZHCC>
the finals are all sudden-deatn <br>elimination, right?
<SYNC Start=189355 End=191648><P Class=ZHCC>
That means as soon as we <br>lose one game, our season is over.
<SYNC Start=191648><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=192567 End=195110><P Class=ZHCC>
Well yeah, but... we usually win.
<SYNC Start=195319 End=196903><P Class=ZHCC>
All the other teams are worse than us.
<SYNC Start=197113 End=200001><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners.
<SYNC Start=200001><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=200741 End=202492><P Class=ZHCC>
I know we can lose if we try.
<SYNC Start=202618 End=205684><P Class=ZHCC>
You mean, throw the game?<br>You know how our parents are about this sport.
<SYNC Start=205746 End=210917><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. My dad always said "It's Okay to lose,<br>but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."
<SYNC Start=210917><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=212920 End=215977><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team <br>quietly that we're gonna let them win,
<SYNC Start=215978 End=217299><P Class=ZHCC>
then we'll act like we're trying.
<SYNC Start=217341 End=218675><P Class=ZHCC>
Our parents will never know.
<SYNC Start=218675><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=219343 End=222304><P Class=ZHCC>
We'd better hope they never know, <br>or else there's gonna be heck to pay.
<SYNC Start=222680 End=223847><P Class=ZHCC>
Heck, I tell ya!
<SYNC Start=223847><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=225933 End=227184><P Class=ZHCC>
Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!
<SYNC Start=227226 End=229144><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em!
<SYNC Start=229144><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=232648 End=233481><P Class=ZHCC>
You're out.
<SYNC Start=233566 End=234983><P Class=ZHCC>
How much was bail this time?
<SYNC Start=235067 End=236484><P Class=ZHCC>
Hundred bucks, no big whoop.
<SYNC Start=236652 End=239404><P Class=ZHCC>
Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad.
<SYNC Start=239572 End=242073><P Class=ZHCC>
Well somebody had to put that<br> knucklehead in his place.
<SYNC Start=242158 End=244159><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, well, you'd better watch <br>yourself in the playoffs.
<SYNC Start=244202 End=245619><P Class=ZHCC>
Wha-what do you mean?
<SYNC Start=245661 End=249247><P Class=ZHCC>
I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy <br>redneck dats up here in the mountains,
<SYNC Start=249290 End=251500><P Class=ZHCC>
but some of those Division Two dads are tough!
<SYNC Start=251626 End=254503><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious.
<SYNC Start=254712 End=257672><P Class=ZHCC>
I can fight anybody. I just need to train.
<SYNC Start=258132 End=261593><P Class=ZHCC>
I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
<SYNC Start=261593><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=263788 End=266816><P Class=ZHCC>
the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay.
<SYNC Start=266816><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=305555 End=310809><P Class=ZHCC>
We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins,<br> and the Little League Division One Playoffs.
<SYNC Start=310809><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=316566 End=318733><P Class=ZHCC>
Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,
<SYNC Start=318818 End=321653><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=321653><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=323781 End=325365><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't think so, South Park
<SYNC Start=325575 End=327033><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, you think we wanna win?
<SYNC Start=327159 End=329190><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=339380 End=341381><P Class=ZHCC>
Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
<SYNC Start=341424 End=342549><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't think so!
<SYNC Start=342675 End=344384><P Class=ZHCC>
There's no way you can lose to us!
<SYNC Start=344427 End=347262><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=347305 End=349055><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=350641 End=352392><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=357356 End=359441><P Class=ZHCC>

Come on, Fort Collins! Let 'em have it! Yeah!
<SYNC Start=363069><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=364530 End=365614><P Class=ZHCC>
Guess that's my guy.
<SYNC Start=365948 End=367616><P Class=ZHCC>
I can take him, no problem.
<SYNC Start=367616><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=369869 End=371369><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, hit one out of the park!
<SYNC Start=371369><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=371996 End=375540><P Class=ZHCC>
And first up for Fort Collins is... Morgan Pratt.
<SYNC Start=375540><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=379212 End=380795><P Class=ZHCC>
Knock it out of the park, Morgan!
<SYNC Start=380963 End=382297><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=393726 End=395185><P Class=ZHCC>
No way! I'm striking out!
<SYNC Start=395311 End=397312><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, he's not gonna swing!<br> So just throw balls.
<SYNC Start=397480 End=399314><P Class=ZHCC>
That way he'll have to walk to first base.
<SYNC Start=399314><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=402693 End=403568><P Class=ZHCC>
Ball!
<SYNC Start=403903 End=404528><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=404612 End=407030><P Class=ZHCC>
- Morgan!<br>- What?
<SYNC Start=407073 End=409741><P Class=ZHCC>
You have to swing when it's a ball,<br>otherwise, you're gonna walk to first base.
<SYNC Start=409825 End=411618><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't swing, only if it's a strike!
<SYNC Start=411786 End=414955><P Class=ZHCC>
Well how the Sam Hell am I supposed to know<br> if he's gonna be throwing a strike or a ball?!
<SYNC Start=415164 End=416456><P Class=ZHCC>
You just have to guess.
<SYNC Start=416624 End=417457><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=420419 End=422045><P Class=ZHCC>

That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch!
<SYNC Start=429095 End=430804><P Class=ZHCC>
You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
<SYNC Start=430847 End=433515><P Class=ZHCC>

Well I thought he was gonna throw<br> a ball that time!
<SYNC Start=445735><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=448114 End=449614><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=462003 End=463962><P Class=ZHCC>
Fort Collins can't play!
<SYNC Start=464338 End=466673><P Class=ZHCC>
Why don't you shut your mouth<br> before I kick your ass!
<SYNC Start=466673><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Strike three!
<SYNC Start=482647><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=486861 End=488737><P Class=ZHCC>
That's it. South Park wins the game.

<SYNC Start=592133 End=595427><P Class=ZHCC>
Can you believe it, Stan?<br> State Championship game.
<SYNC Start=595427><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=596179 End=598263><P Class=ZHCC>
It's... the greatest thing ever.
<SYNC Start=598263><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=600433 End=601933><P Class=ZHCC>
Goddamnit.
<SYNC Start=601933><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=603394 End=605478><P Class=ZHCC>
I've worked hard, believed in myself,
<SYNC Start=605897 End=609024><P Class=ZHCC>
and now I'm gonna be fighting in a <br>State Championship game.
<SYNC Start=609024><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=610193 End=612694><P Class=ZHCC>
This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life.
<SYNC Start=612694><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

This is News 4, at noon.

The Colorado Little League State Championship<br> is being played this week.
<SYNC Start=621829 End=626416><P Class=ZHCC>
Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head<br> at the major-league stadium downtown.
<SYNC Start=626416><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=626918 End=632005><P Class=ZHCC>
Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers <br>and some of their parents, and I can;t tell you how excited they are.
<SYNC Start=632215 End=633965><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
<SYNC Start=634091 End=635675><P Class=ZHCC>
Win? Why the hell would we want to win?
<SYNC Start=635676 End=638553><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.
<SYNC Start=638554 End=641431><P Class=ZHCC>
Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for<br> the South Park Little League team, and Stan,
<SYNC Start=641807 End=644643><P Class=ZHCC>
how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?
<SYNC Start=645061 End=645727><P Class=ZHCC>
Gay.
<SYNC Start=645895 End=647896><P Class=ZHCC>
Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son.
<SYNC Start=647939 End=650357><P Class=ZHCC>
They've worked really hard to get here,<br> Chris,and, you know,
<SYNC Start=650399 End=654361><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't like to really "trash-talk," but,<br> I don't think Denver has a chance.
<SYNC Start=654654 End=658365><P Class=ZHCC>
Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' <br>parents would disagree with you and your team-
<SYNC Start=658407 End=660534><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh yeah!<br>Oh yeah!
<SYNC Start=660785 End=662827><P Class=ZHCC>
South Park is goin' down!
<SYNC Start=662912 End=664788><P Class=ZHCC>
Feel it comin'!
<SYNC Start=664831 End=666665><P Class=ZHCC>
You ain't got a chance, South Park!
<SYNC Start=666707 End=669709><P Class=ZHCC>
Here we go, Denver, here we go!
<SYNC Start=669877 End=670710><P Class=ZHCC>
Who's that?
<SYNC Start=670753 End=673088><P Class=ZHCC>
That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers.
<SYNC Start=673172 End=677425><P Class=ZHCC>
He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit <br>and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight.
<SYNC Start=677510 End=680762><P Class=ZHCC>
There ain't no way some little<br> mountain kids can beat Denver.
<SYNC Start=680805 End=682973><P Class=ZHCC>
Not with my son on second base!
<SYNC Start=683099 End=685642><P Class=ZHCC>
Oho, looks like we got some parental<br> trash talking going on here.
<SYNC Start=685685 End=686935><P Class=ZHCC>
Mr. Marsh, any comments?
<SYNC Start=687019 End=688395><P Class=ZHCC>
Well I think that there's a uh...
<SYNC Start=688437 End=689688><P Class=ZHCC>
Mr. Marsh??
<SYNC Start=689730 End=691898><P Class=ZHCC>
Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?!
<SYNC Start=691941 End=695277><P Class=ZHCC>
Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father!
<SYNC Start=695361 End=697988><P Class=ZHCC>
Iii am the Bat Dad!
<SYNC Start=698030 End=699865><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on.
<SYNC Start=699907 End=703618><P Class=ZHCC>
Bat Dad knows no fear!<br> Bat Dad knows no pain!
<SYNC Start=703661 End=706163><P Class=ZHCC>
I want you, Marsh! I want you!!
<SYNC Start=706163><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=707248 End=708957><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, tension is certainly high here,
<SYNC Start=709000 End=711459><P Class=ZHCC>
but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field.
<SYNC Start=711669 End=713295><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God.
<SYNC Start=713295><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=713921 End=715755><P Class=ZHCC>
Good luck! You're gonna need it.
<SYNC Start=715798 End=718133><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible.
<SYNC Start=718133><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=720011 End=722387><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, what are we gonna do??<br> We can't win this game.
<SYNC Start=722388 End=724055><P Class=ZHCC>
Wiat. I've got it, you guys.
<SYNC Start=724098 End=728518><P Class=ZHCC>
A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes<br> out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
<SYNC Start=728686 End=730854><P Class=ZHCC>
Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
<SYNC Start=730897 End=732063><P Class=ZHCC>
Exactly right, Clyde.
<SYNC Start=732231 End=736985><P Class=ZHCC>
So what we need... is to find somebody<br> to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
<SYNC Start=737111 End=737944><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey yeah.
<SYNC Start=738112 End=740739><P Class=ZHCC>
We need to find the very worst<br> kid athlete in the whole world.
<SYNC Start=740781 End=742407><P Class=ZHCC>
Somebody who can't possibly win.
<SYNC Start=742575 End=743408><P Class=ZHCC>
But who?
<SYNC Start=743408><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=743993 End=744826><P Class=ZHCC>
I know who.
<SYNC Start=744826><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=745995 End=749372><P Class=ZHCC>
Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, <br>from New York City.
<SYNC Start=749372><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=752793 End=754503><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm baaack!
<SYNC Start=754503><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=755755 End=759049><P Class=ZHCC>
There he is! Now, don't let him know we<br> think he's a loser, or else he won't play.
<SYNC Start=759049><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=760885 End=762010><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello, cousin Kyle.
<SYNC Start=762053 End=763887><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible.
<SYNC Start=763930 End=766848><P Class=ZHCC>
They served a chicken dish with<br> hot sauce and it gave me gas.
<SYNC Start=766933 End=768892><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
<SYNC Start=768893 End=772020><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am.
<SYNC Start=772104 End=774272><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though.
<SYNC Start=774315 End=778360><P Class=ZHCC>
Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for<br> so long and then the heat steams up my glasses.
<SYNC Start=778360><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=779403 End=780403><P Class=ZHCC>
He's perfect.
<SYNC Start=780446 End=783156><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, with him on our team,<br> we don't stand a chance.
<SYNC Start=783156><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=834667 End=835750><P Class=ZHCC>
...I'm not gonna go.
<SYNC Start=835750><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=837128 End=837752><P Class=ZHCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=837752><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=838796 End=840297><P Class=ZHCC>
Stan's little league game, I'm...
<SYNC Start=840715 End=841715><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm not gonna go.
<SYNC Start=841715><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=842800 End=843633><P Class=ZHCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=843633><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=845011 End=848680><P Class=ZHCC>
I just... don't think I can, all right?
<SYNC Start=848680><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=849640 End=851057><P Class=ZHCC>
You don't think you can?!
<SYNC Start=851100 End=852767><P Class=ZHCC>
This is the biggest game of your son's life!
<SYNC Start=852810 End=854060><P Class=ZHCC>
Wny wouldn't you go and support him? What-?
<SYNC Start=854103 End=855812><P Class=ZHCC>
Because I'm scared, all right?!
<SYNC Start=855812><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=857857 End=861234><P Class=ZHCC>
You wanna break me down?!<br> You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared!
<SYNC Start=861234><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=862445 End=864571><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.
<SYNC Start=864989 End=867282><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
<SYNC Start=867282><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=868743 End=870327><P Class=ZHCC>
So then, don't.
<SYNC Start=870453 End=873747><P Class=ZHCC>
You don't have to get in fights<br> with other parents at Little League games!
<SYNC Start=873789 End=875248><P Class=ZHCC>
Just sit there and watch!
<SYNC Start=875248><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=876167 End=878043><P Class=ZHCC>
Look, I get what you're trying to do.
<SYNC Start=878043><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=878753 End=882047><P Class=ZHCC>
You're trying to get me to realize that<br> I have to fight him because it's who I am.
<SYNC Start=882089 End=886468><P Class=ZHCC>
No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown <br>out of games and make an ass of yourself.
<SYNC Start=886511 End=887677><P Class=ZHCC>
I've lost the edge.
<SYNC Start=887677><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=888513 End=889763><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm sorry, Sharon.
<SYNC Start=890139 End=892557><P Class=ZHCC>
But you have to take Stan to his <br>Little League game alone.
<SYNC Start=892557><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=897813 End=901399><P Class=ZHCC>
Welcoem to the Colorado Little League<br> State Championship Game!
<SYNC Start=901399><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=902735 End=904528><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=904570 End=906279><P Class=ZHCC>
A chance to go to the national circuit.
<SYNC Start=906279><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

I don't think so! You guys are way too good!

You're the best at this game!
<SYNC Start=917792 End=918750><P Class=ZHCC>
You're the best!
<SYNC Start=918793 End=921294><P Class=ZHCC>
You guys are so good you'll probably go <br>all the way to win the national title!
<SYNC Start=921337 End=923296><P Class=ZHCC>
Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!
<SYNC Start=923381 End=927259><P Class=ZHCC>
Here we go, Denver!<br> These South Park kids got nothin' on you!
<SYNC Start=927301 End=928927><P Class=ZHCC>
Let's go, Denver!
<SYNC Start=929178 End=930679><P Class=ZHCC>
Chris, will you sit down?
<SYNC Start=931097 End=933682><P Class=ZHCC>
First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz.
<SYNC Start=933682><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=935518 End=936810><P Class=ZHCC>
Where do I stand?

R-right over here.
<SYNC Start=938311><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=945361 End=949197><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't throw the ball too fast, <br>because I might get startled and I have asthma.
<SYNC Start=949197><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=952577 End=953743><P Class=ZHCC>

Oh Jesus!

<SYNC Start=968176 End=970135><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, he IS great at sucking.
<SYNC Start=970261 End=972179><P Class=ZHCC>
We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
<SYNC Start=972346 End=974931><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't throw it so hard or so close next time!
<SYNC Start=974974 End=977475><P Class=ZHCC>

Aw crap!
<SYNC Start=992157><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

I can't, I can't keep running like this!
<SYNC Start=1000625 End=1002000><P Class=ZHCC>
I have corns in my feet!
<SYNC Start=1002000><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1002752 End=1003793><P Class=ZHCC>
Keep running, kid!
<SYNC Start=1004003 End=1007631><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=1007631><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1009509 End=1010592><P Class=ZHCC>
Safe!
<SYNC Start=1010592><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Oh Jesus, did you see that??

I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody!
<SYNC Start=1018934><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Oh my God... their pitcher was <br>able to hit him right on the bat.

Dude, we had it all wrong.
<SYNC Start=1025149 End=1027317><P Class=ZHCC>

No!

All right, Denver! You're up to bat now!

<SYNC Start=1053719 End=1054553><P Class=ZHCC>
Out!
<SYNC Start=1054553><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1055847 End=1058181><P Class=ZHCC>
Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!
<SYNC Start=1058181><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1064188 End=1068066><P Class=ZHCC>
Our whole summer, dude.<br> We have to play this boring game all summer long.
<SYNC Start=1068317 End=1069818><P Class=ZHCC>
Son of a biscuit!
<SYNC Start=1069818><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field;

<SYNC Start=1078869><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Come on, Denver!
<SYNC Start=1085501 End=1086710><P Class=ZHCC>
Get the lead out!

Do not cross the Bat Daaad!
<SYNC Start=1089922 End=1091715><P Class=ZHCC>
Geez I realy wish this guy would shut up.
<SYNC Start=1091883 End=1096720><P Class=ZHCC>
Why don't you just go home, South Park?<br> You can't beat Denver!
<SYNC Start=1096929 End=1098722><P Class=ZHCC>
Denver sucks ass!
<SYNC Start=1098722><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1106439 End=1109357><P Class=ZHCC>
Come on, South Park! <br>These kids can't play!
<SYNC Start=1109357><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1109984 End=1112986><P Class=ZHCC>
In fact, these kids are terrible!
<SYNC Start=1112986><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1117283 End=1118366><P Class=ZHCC>
Strike 2!
<SYNC Start=1118493 End=1120160><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh Jesus, we're gonna win!
<SYNC Start=1120203 End=1123038><P Class=ZHCC>
I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting.
<SYNC Start=1123038><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1124332 End=1127250><P Class=ZHCC>
It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!
<SYNC Start=1127668 End=1130921><P Class=ZHCC>
You'd better shut your mouth<br> before I shut it for you!
<SYNC Start=1130921><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1132632 End=1134049><P Class=ZHCC>
What do you wanna do, huh?
<SYNC Start=1134049><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1141974 End=1143391><P Class=ZHCC>
This can't get any worse.
<SYNC Start=1143391><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1149232 End=1151233><P Class=ZHCC>
Now for the finishing move!
<SYNC Start=1151233><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1151776 End=1154903><P Class=ZHCC>
You're about to be Bat-Dadded!
<SYNC Start=1154903><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1159450 End=1164371><P Class=ZHCC>
It all comes down to this! South Park is just<br>one pitch away from being State Champions.
<SYNC Start=1164371><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1167625 End=1170252><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting.
<SYNC Start=1170545 End=1173547><P Class=ZHCC>
They'd better be careful. <br>The Little League has a no-tolerance policy.
<SYNC Start=1173547><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1174549 End=1178009><P Class=ZHCC>
Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!
<SYNC Start=1178009><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1179178 End=1180345><P Class=ZHCC>
