N'kay, kids, as your counselor,
<SYNC Start=39285 End=45332><P Class=ZHCC>
I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk<br>about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay?
<SYNC Start=45542 End=48734><P Class=ZHCC>
So, as you remember, last week I told<br>you to write down any
<SYNC Start=48735 End=50212><P Class=ZHCC>
difficult questions you had
<SYNC Start=50255 End=55968><P Class=ZHCC>
and put them in this box anonymously so<br>we could discuss in class, m'kay?
<SYNC Start=56136 End=59054><P Class=ZHCC>
I got a lot o' responses, <br>so let's read some aloud.
<SYNC Start=59054><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=60974 End=63350><P Class=ZHCC>
"Mr. Mackey is gay."
<SYNC Start=63350><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=65812 End=68021><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay kids, that is not funny! Unkay?!
<SYNC Start=68189 End=70691><P Class=ZHCC>
This box is supposed to<br> be used for serious questions!
<SYNC Start=70733 End=74820><P Class=ZHCC>
About, about serious issues! M'kay,<br>let's let's stop the tomfoolery!
<SYNC Start=75238 End=76989><P Class=ZHCC>
M'kay, this looks like a real one here.
<SYNC Start=77323 End=78740><P Class=ZHCC>
"Dear Mr. Mackey,
<SYNC Start=78908 End=80367><P Class=ZHCC>
you are gay."
<SYNC Start=80367><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=81619 End=83120><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, all right. That's enough, kids.
<SYNC Start=83246 End=85789><P Class=ZHCC>
Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay?
<SYNC Start=85957 End=87207><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh here we go. Okay,
<SYNC Start=87459 End=90252><P Class=ZHCC>
"Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me,
<SYNC Start=90295 End=92045><P Class=ZHCC>
and you are gay."
<SYNC Start=92045><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=93506 End=95883><P Class=ZHCC>
Damnit, is there not one serious <br>question in here?!
<SYNC Start=96217 End=98610><P Class=ZHCC>
"Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey is gay"
<SYNC Start=98720 End=99595><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, here.
<SYNC Start=99595><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=100722 End=103015><P Class=ZHCC>
I am a boy at South Park Elementary.
<SYNC Start=103099 End=108437><P Class=ZHCC>
Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class,<br>my penis becomes hard for no reason.
<SYNC Start=108605 End=110063><P Class=ZHCC>
What should I do?
<SYNC Start=110063><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=116780 End=118781><P Class=ZHCC>
All right kids, all right kids,<br>that's enough!
<SYNC Start=118781><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=122160 End=124119><P Class=ZHCC>
If you all can't be serious<br>about the question box,
<SYNC Start=124162 End=127664><P Class=ZHCC>
then we'll just do drug<br>identification exercises, unkay?!
<SYNC Start=127664><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=129167 End=133087><P Class=ZHCC>
M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here<br>and write down the names of two narcotics?
<SYNC Start=133087><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=133671 End=135339><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh no, that that's okay, Mr. Mackey.
<SYNC Start=135423 End=137174><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!
<SYNC Start=137467 End=139551><P Class=ZHCC>
Uhhh, just uh uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.
<SYNC Start=139886 End=141345><P Class=ZHCC>
Well why the hell not?!
<SYNC Start=141345><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=148978 End=149895><P Class=ZHCC>
He's what...
<SYNC Start=149895><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=151022 End=152189><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, you do?
<SYNC Start=152189><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=153316 End=154983><P Class=ZHCC>
R r right now, right now it is?
<SYNC Start=155360 End=157694><P Class=ZHCC>
on'kay, on'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.
<SYNC Start=157694><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=158988 End=160948><P Class=ZHCC>
N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else.
<SYNC Start=160990 End=162574><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, why don't you come up here?
<SYNC Start=162617 End=164827><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, that's bullcrap?!<br> How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!
<SYNC Start=164869 End=167788><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now.
<SYNC Start=167788><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=168706 End=169832><P Class=ZHCC>
He's what??

<SYNC Start=179968 End=182761><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, what's the point? Jimmy always <br>wins with his stand-up comedy.
<SYNC Start=182887 End=183720><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=183763 End=186682><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=191604 End=193313><P Class=ZHCC>
How do you get up in front of that many people?
<SYNC Start=193356 End=195023><P Class=ZHCC>
Well fellas, entertainment is my life.
<SYNC Start=195066 End=196358><P Class=ZHCC>
I love being in front of everyone.
<SYNC Start=196358><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=200155 End=200988><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=211499 End=212272><P Class=ZHCC>
It's occupied.
<SYNC Start=212272><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=213626 End=215419><P Class=ZHCC>
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.
<SYNC Start=215419><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=222469 End=223510><P Class=ZHCC>
Hehey Jimmy!
<SYNC Start=223510><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=229768 End=232478><P Class=ZHCC>
M'boy, did you see that first<br>prize for the talent show?
<SYNC Start=232520 End=235481><P Class=ZHCC>
Why you must be excited!<br>You'll probably win like always.
<SYNC Start=235732 End=237608><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited.
<SYNC Start=237692 End=239443><P Class=ZHCC>
REAL escited...<br>for some reason...
<SYNC Start=239443><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=240028 End=242404><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?
<SYNC Start=242404><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=244073 End=247409><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?!<br>How about a courtesy flush?!
<SYNC Start=247702 End=248952><P Class=ZHCC>
Up yours, Butters.
<SYNC Start=248952><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=254167 End=255834><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey Jimmy, how was school?
<SYNC Start=255919 End=256668><P Class=ZHCC>
Fine, Mom.
<SYNC Start=256711 End=260047><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy, we understand you're getting<br>erections in the classroom.
<SYNC Start=260047><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=261007 End=262674><P Class=ZHCC>
What? Uh who told you that?
<SYNC Start=262759 End=264510><P Class=ZHCC>
Mr. Mackey, your counselor.
<SYNC Start=264552 End=266762><P Class=ZHCC>
Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!
<SYNC Start=266846 End=269723><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
<SYNC Start=269766 End=273185><P Class=ZHCC>
But we know it's something you might have<br>a hard time talking about.
<SYNC Start=273269 End=275062><P Class=ZHCC>
Get it? A hard time.
<SYNC Start=275062><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=275772 End=280835><P Class=ZHCC>
So, we took your counselor'sadvice 'nd called <br>Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this.
<SYNC Start=280860 End=282069><P Class=ZHCC>
Dz-n-Doctor Pal?
<SYNC Start=282112 End=283487><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal.
<SYNC Start=283530 End=285864><P Class=ZHCC>
That's because I'm a doctor,<br>but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?
<SYNC Start=286241 End=286990><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, sure?
<SYNC Start=287117 End=289743><P Class=ZHCC>
A lot of times parents call me in because<br>I can relate to younger kids.
<SYNC Start=289786 End=291703><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig?
<SYNC Start=291746 End=294123><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, I understand you have some<br>concerns about erections.
<SYNC Start=294165 End=295791><P Class=ZHCC>
Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right.
<SYNC Start=295834 End=297459><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh God, I feel so weird" huh?
<SYNC Start=297459><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=297961 End=299128><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, a little, yes.
<SYNC Start=299170 End=301130><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections.
<SYNC Start=301172 End=305092><P Class=ZHCC>
Almost every boy goes through a phase where<br>his penisbecomes hard... for no particular reason.
<SYNC Start=305135 End=306218><P Class=ZHCC>
It's just part of grwoing up.
<SYNC Start=306428 End=308887><P Class=ZHCC>
Growing up?<br>Growing out is more like it.
<SYNC Start=308887><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=309389 End=312349><P Class=ZHCC>
But I have to make it stop!<br>The talent show is this F-Friday.
<SYNC Start=312392 End=316145><P Class=ZHCC>
Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skidaddle<br>for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo.
<SYNC Start=316354 End=318021><P Class=ZHCC>
A-all right, come on, honey.
<SYNC Start=318021><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=318982 End=321817><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy, as you get older your body<br>goes through a lot of changes.
<SYNC Start=321860 End=325779><P Class=ZHCC>
Certain hormones start to release as your<br>whole reproductive system begins to awaken,
<SYNC Start=325822 End=328323><P Class=ZHCC>
and so, if you like, we can<br>take off our shirts and kiss.
<SYNC Start=328323><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=330618 End=331869><P Class=ZHCC>
Ke...c-come again?
<SYNC Start=331911 End=332950><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, hey, nothin', you see?
<SYNC Start=332951 End=336999><P Class=ZHCC>
See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you<br>thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.
<SYNC Start=337041 End=339460><P Class=ZHCC>
Unless, of course, you think we should<br> take off our shirts and kiss.
<SYNC Start=339794 End=341879><P Class=ZHCC>
N-no, I do NOT want to take<br>off my shirt and kiss.
<SYNC Start=342005 End=344506><P Class=ZHCC>
Well then to hell with you, kid.<br>You can just deal with your problems on your own.
<SYNC Start=344506><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=351931 End=353379><P Class=ZHCC>
Next up for the talent show:
<SYNC Start=353380 End=357102><P Class=ZHCC>
put your hands together for the incredibly<br> talented Jimmy Valmer!
<SYNC Start=357102><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=360023 End=361440><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, what a what a great audience.
<SYNC Start=361900 End=363400><P Class=ZHCC>
So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail.
<SYNC Start=363568 End=365360><P Class=ZHCC>
Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this?
<SYNC Start=365612 End=367311><P Class=ZHCC>
She's very excited to get started on her new show,
<SYNC Start=367312 End=370566><P Class=ZHCC>
"Martha Stewart Living,<br>with an electronic ankle bracelet."
<SYNC Start=370566><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=373161 End=375871><P Class=ZHCC>
So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope.
<SYNC Start=376289 End=377748><P Class=ZHCC>
Have you seen this, have you heard about this?
<SYNC Start=377748><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=381711 End=383670><P Class=ZHCC>
A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope,
<SYNC Start=383713 End=386131><P Class=ZHCC>
a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.
<SYNC Start=386131><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=388051 End=390886><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson<br>is having back problem in court.
<SYNC Start=391054 End=394431><P Class=ZHCC>
You know... huh... you uh you know what<br>they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.
<SYNC Start=394431><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=398770 End=400062><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.
<SYNC Start=400105 End=401563><P Class=ZHCC>
What a fantastic audience.
<SYNC Start=401563><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=402065 End=404066><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't worry, Jimmy.<br>We're not laughing with you,
<SYNC Start=404234 End=405484><P Class=ZHCC>
we're laughing AT you.
<SYNC Start=405484><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=415829 End=417871><P Class=ZHCC>
Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples,
<SYNC Start=417914 End=419873><P Class=ZHCC>
Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too.
<SYNC Start=419958 End=421834><P Class=ZHCC>
Lu Lu Lu, let's get together,
<SYNC Start=421876 End=424169><P Class=ZHCC>
- I know what we can do, Lu Lu.<br>- Butters!
<SYNC Start=424212 End=425671><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.
<SYNC Start=425671><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=426214 End=427881><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
<SYNC Start=427966 End=429758><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody,
<SYNC Start=429801 End=432344><P Class=ZHCC>
and I think maybe you're the only<br>person who won't make f-f-fun of me.
<SYNC Start=432387 End=435222><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of<br>somebody with a problem.
<SYNC Start=435306 End=438517><P Class=ZHCC>
Butters, do you know what you're supposed<br>to do when your penis gets hard?
<SYNC Start=438517><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=440603 End=441854><P Class=ZHCC>
Well sure I do.
<SYNC Start=441896 End=442729><P Class=ZHCC>
Really??
<SYNC Start=442939 End=445524><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, now sit down, Jimmy,<br>we should have a little talk.
<SYNC Start=445524><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=446359 End=452670><P Class=ZHCC>
You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard,<br>the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina."
<SYNC Start=452991 End=456618><P Class=ZHCC>
Then, the hard penis sneezes<br>milk inside the lady's tummy,
<SYNC Start=456661 End=459997><P Class=ZHCC>
and after it's all done sneezin' milk. <br>The penis stops bein' hard,
<SYNC Start=460039 End=462207><P Class=ZHCC>
and the man loses interest in the lady.
<SYNC Start=462207><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=463585 End=467792><P Class=ZHCC>
So, when your penis becomes hard,<br>you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina.
<SYNC Start=468214 End=469590><P Class=ZHCC>
And then it stops being hard?
<SYNC Start=469716 End=470841><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right, Jimmy.
<SYNC Start=470967 End=472718><P Class=ZHCC>
But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in?
<SYNC Start=472761 End=474428><P Class=ZHCC>
The talent show is this Friday.
<SYNC Start=474428><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=477474 End=478932><P Class=ZHCC>
Talk to you, Bertha.
<SYNC Start=478975 End=480517><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, see you later, Jessie.
<SYNC Start=480517><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=481936 End=482978><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey Bertha.
<SYNC Start=483271 End=485439><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, hey Jimmy.<br>What's goin' on?
<SYNC Start=485523 End=488901><P Class=ZHCC>
Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could<br>stick my penis in your vagina?
<SYNC Start=488901><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=489569 End=490986><P Class=ZHCC>
What?? No way!
<SYNC Start=491196 End=492988><P Class=ZHCC>
But the talent show is tomorrow!
<SYNC Start=492988><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=493490 End=494114><P Class=ZHCC>
Jerk!
<SYNC Start=494114><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=494783 End=496742><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
<SYNC Start=496785 End=498285><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
<SYNC Start=498328 End=501663><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, you don't just go up to a girl<br>and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina.
<SYNC Start=501706 End=504333><P Class=ZHCC>
Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take<br>her out for some Italian food.
<SYNC Start=504459 End=506043><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, seems like you know a lot<br>about this stuff, Eric.
<SYNC Start=506086 End=507252><P Class=ZHCC>
Have you gotten laid before?
<SYNC Start=507295 End=508587><P Class=ZHCC>
Sure, lots of times.
<SYNC Start=508630 End=510631><P Class=ZHCC>
I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
<SYNC Start=510673 End=511799><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, wha-what do I do?
<SYNC Start=511841 End=513634><P Class=ZHCC>
I told you: a date and then Italian food.
<SYNC Start=513676 End=515302><P Class=ZHCC>
And then you gotta make her<br>thnk you're a good listener.
<SYNC Start=515345 End=519223><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very<br>important that I score to-night!
<SYNC Start=519265 End=522101><P Class=ZHCC>
Can you come on the date and help me?<br>You're like a white... Hitch.
<SYNC Start=522185 End=524394><P Class=ZHCC>
Why sure, they do this all<br>the time in movies and TV shows.
<SYNC Start=524437 End=526438><P Class=ZHCC>
You go on the date and wear an earpiece,
<SYNC Start=526523 End=529441><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=545166 End=547042><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, Shawna, you look fantastic.
<SYNC Start=547085 End=549044><P Class=ZHCC>
Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?
<SYNC Start=549087 End=552506><P Class=ZHCC>
We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant,<br>Buca de Fagghecini.
<SYNC Start=552506><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=556094 End=560139><P Class=ZHCC>
Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for<br>the authentico experience Italiano.
<SYNC Start=560181 End=561640><P Class=ZHCC>
My name is Roma.
<SYNC Start=561683 End=564393><P Class=ZHCC>
Can I start you out with some lotsa<br>pasta macaroni minis?
<SYNC Start=564477 End=567438><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic<br>pizzareli casserona poppers.
<SYNC Start=567564 End=568522><P Class=ZHCC>
Right away.
<SYNC Start=568522><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=569149 End=571608><P Class=ZHCC>
You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school?
<SYNC Start=571651 End=573110><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't stand her.
<SYNC Start=573236 End=574194><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy! Jimmy!
<SYNC Start=574404 End=577333><P Class=ZHCC>
Jimmy, even though what she's saying now<br>isn't interesting at all, you say:
<SYNC Start=577334 End=579992><P Class=ZHCC>
"Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
<SYNC Start=580452 End=582786><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
<SYNC Start=582829 End=583787><P Class=ZHCC>
Really?
<SYNC Start=583830 End=586857><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, Kelligan bought the same purse<br>and I was like, "No WAY do I want it now!"
<SYNC Start=586958 End=589209><P Class=ZHCC>
because who wants a purse that both their<br>best friends have, right? And so-
<SYNC Start=589252 End=590794><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, when she stops yappin' again,
<SYNC Start=590837 End=593756><P Class=ZHCC>
say: "Wow, I've never thought<br>of it that way before, but you're right."
<SYNC Start=593965 End=596508><P Class=ZHCC>
-I guess that's why I figured,<br>"Who needs friends like that?"
<SYNC Start=596551 End=599052><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, I've never thought of it<br>that way before, but you're right.
<SYNC Start=599095 End=600262><P Class=ZHCC>
It's like I told Debbie:
<SYNC Start=600305 End=601597><P Class=ZHCC>
"If you're gonna go out with my friends-"
<SYNC Start=601639 End=603432><P Class=ZHCC>
All right Jimmy,<br>when she finally shuts her trap again,
<SYNC Start=603475 End=605100><P Class=ZHCC>
I want you to repeat whatever she said,
<SYNC Start=605143 End=607728><P Class=ZHCC>
and then follow it with: "Wow, how insightful."
<SYNC Start=607979 End=610481><P Class=ZHCC>
"And so if you're gonna be that way,<br>I don't need to be your friend."
<SYNC Start=610565 End=613984><P Class=ZHCC>
"if you're gonna be that way, I don't need<br>to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.
<SYNC Start=614027 End=616695><P Class=ZHCC>
You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.
<SYNC Start=616863 End=617488><P Class=ZHCC>
Really?
<SYNC Start=617530 End=621200><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. I mean, no other boys really<br>communicate like you do.
<SYNC Start=621201 End=622701><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna,
<SYNC Start=622786 End=624953><P Class=ZHCC>
because I really wanna stick<br>my penis in your vagina.
<SYNC Start=625330 End=626580><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
<SYNC Start=626580><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=627707 End=629500><P Class=ZHCC>
...What??? I'm not doing that!
<SYNC Start=629626 End=631710><P Class=ZHCC>
But the talent show is tomorrow night!
<SYNC Start=631753 End=632402><P Class=ZHCC>

Jimmy, what are you doing here?<br>The talent show is inside.
<SYNC Start=692856 End=694940><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show.
<SYNC Start=694940><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=696443 End=697693><P Class=ZHCC>
Not perform?
<SYNC Start=697861 End=701613><P Class=ZHCC>
But Jimmy, you love talent shows.<br>Everyone in town knows that.
<SYNC Start=701823 End=704408><P Class=ZHCC>
I just c-can't risk getting up<br>in front of everyone.
<SYNC Start=704408><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=705118 End=706076><P Class=ZHCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=706411 End=708912><P Class=ZHCC>
All right! I I keep getting<br>an erection for no reason! Okay!
<SYNC Start=708955 End=711790><P Class=ZHCC>
But I can't get any of the girls<br>here to let me... do it to them.
<SYNC Start=711833 End=715169><P Class=ZHCC>
Well of course not, Jimmy.<br>Little girls don't wanna have sex.
<SYNC Start=715211 End=717337><P Class=ZHCC>
Then why does God make it so<br>that my penis gets hard
<SYNC Start=717380 End=719882><P Class=ZHCC>
...if girls don't wanna<br>have it in their vaginas?
<SYNC Start=720133 End=721467><P Class=ZHCC>
It's like a cruel joke.
<SYNC Start=721509 End=727806><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure.<br>They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.
<SYNC Start=727806><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=728349 End=729933><P Class=ZHCC>
...Colfax Point?
<SYNC Start=730101 End=733020><P Class=ZHCC>
Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.
<SYNC Start=733062 End=733937><P Class=ZHCC>
Really?
<SYNC Start=734147 End=736940><P Class=ZHCC>
M-maybe I can catch the bus <br>...and get down there before the talent show ends.
<SYNC Start=737025 End=738358><P Class=ZHCC>
Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady!
<SYNC Start=738610 End=740152><P Class=ZHCC>

<SYNC Start=1070524><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1075989 End=1077781><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't worry, Nut Gobbler!<br>I'm coming!
<SYNC Start=1077781><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1081327 End=1082619><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh Jesus, not now.
<SYNC Start=1082619><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1083371 End=1084747><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh boy, this is embarassing.
<SYNC Start=1084747><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1085957 End=1088250><P Class=ZHCC>
And now we have Eric Cartman,
<SYNC Start=1088293 End=1092129><P Class=ZHCC>
who will be doing select<br>readings from the movie, Scarface.
<SYNC Start=1092129><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1096634 End=1097760><P Class=ZHCC>
D'you know what you are?
<SYNC Start=1098052 End=1100304><P Class=ZHCC>
You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches!
<SYNC Start=1100346 End=1101847><P Class=ZHCC>
You need people like me!
<SYNC Start=1102140 End=1104808><P Class=ZHCC>
You need people like me so you<br>can point your fucking finger
<SYNC Start=1104851 End=1106393><P Class=ZHCC>
and say "That's the bad guy!"
<SYNC Start=1106436 End=1108353><P Class=ZHCC>
Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
<SYNC Start=1108813 End=1110397><P Class=ZHCC>
That's my little boy.
<SYNC Start=1110397><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1111608 End=1113484><P Class=ZHCC>
Please, Q Money!<br>Don't do this!
<SYNC Start=1113526 End=1115402><P Class=ZHCC>
I told you never to turn on me, ho!
<SYNC Start=1115402><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1115904 End=1117821><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, j-j-jackass!
<SYNC Start=1117821><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1119532 End=1121617><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm sorry I resorted to calling<br>you jackass just now,
<SYNC Start=1121659 End=1123077><P Class=ZHCC>
but I'm very upset!
<SYNC Start=1123119 End=1126914><P Class=ZHCC>
And what are you gonna do, huh?!<br>I've got four feet on you AND a gun!
<SYNC Start=1126956 End=1128082><P Class=ZHCC>
What do you have?!
<SYNC Start=1128124 End=1128957><P Class=ZHCC>
What do I have?
<SYNC Start=1129125 End=1130292><P Class=ZHCC>
The weapon of comedy.
<SYNC Start=1130668 End=1133045><P Class=ZHCC>
So apparently the Chinese and<br>the Japanese aren't getting along lately.
<SYNC Start=1133088 End=1134755><P Class=ZHCC>
Have you seen this?<br>Have you heard about this?
<SYNC Start=1134755><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1135256 End=1135881><P Class=ZHCC>
What?!
<SYNC Start=1135924 End=1139384><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't<br>been getting along with my stomach for years.
<SYNC Start=1139384><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1141096 End=1142346><P Class=ZHCC>
That's pretty good.
<SYNC Start=1142472 End=1144765><P Class=ZHCC>
Martha Stewart is out of jail.<br>Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
<SYNC Start=1144765><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1146684 End=1148393><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh yeah. That's right, she is.
<SYNC Start=1148436 End=1150938><P Class=ZHCC>
She's apparently gotten real good<br>with baking cakes with keys in them.
<SYNC Start=1150938><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1153942 End=1155901><P Class=ZHCC>
Serves you right, you son of a bitch!
<SYNC Start=1155944 End=1157528><P Class=ZHCC>
Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler.
<SYNC Start=1157570 End=1159988><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't believe you chased me all this way.
<SYNC Start=1159988><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1160990 End=1162699><P Class=ZHCC>
You, you really care about me.
<SYNC Start=1162742 End=1164701><P Class=ZHCC>
Not really. You're just a hooker,<br>and I need to get laid.
<SYNC Start=1164744 End=1166203><P Class=ZHCC>
The talent show could be over any minute.
<SYNC Start=1166246 End=1167830><P Class=ZHCC>
That's good enough for me.
<SYNC Start=1167830><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1168456 End=1169957><P Class=ZHCC>
Take me to bed.
<SYNC Start=1169957><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1227515 End=1230058><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you.
<SYNC Start=1230058><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1230894 End=1234271><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, children, it looks<br>like we have no more contestants,
<SYNC Start=1234314 End=1236648><P Class=ZHCC>
which means, the Talent Show is over!
<SYNC Start=1236648><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1238526 End=1239777><P Class=ZHCC>
Mr. Mackey, it's over.
<SYNC Start=1240028 End=1241403><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh oh oh, right.
<SYNC Start=1241571 End=1246116><P Class=ZHCC>
Now we will tally up the judges' scores<br>and find out which act they hated the least.
<SYNC Start=1246159 End=1247743><P Class=ZHCC>
Hold everything!
<SYNC Start=1247743><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1258838 End=1261507><P Class=ZHCC>
Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind,<br>I'll be taking that microphone..
<SYNC Start=1261591 End=1265344><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, let's put our hands<br>together for Jimmy Valmer.
<SYNC Start=1265344><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1268306 End=1269556><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, what a terrific audience.
<SYNC Start=1269766 End=1271975><P Class=ZHCC>
So apparently it's been exactly<br>two years since the fall of Baghdad.
<SYNC Start=1272018 End=1273310><P Class=ZHCC>
Have you seen this?<br>Have you heard about this?
<SYNC Start=1273394 End=1277022><P Class=ZHCC>
Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell,<br>Iraq fell, Saddam fell.
<SYNC Start=1277107 End=1279608><P Class=ZHCC>
The only thing that didn't fall was<br>...the price of gas.
<SYNC Start=1279608><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1281319 End=1283278><P Class=ZHCC>
I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan.
<SYNC Start=1283363 End=1284696><P Class=ZHCC>
Have you seen this?<br>Have you heard about this?
<SYNC Start=1284781 End=1286615><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to-
<SYNC Start=1286615><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1289869 End=1291203><P Class=ZHCC>
You've gotta be kidding me.
