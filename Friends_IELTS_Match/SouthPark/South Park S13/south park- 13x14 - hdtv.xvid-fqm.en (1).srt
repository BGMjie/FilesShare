Yeah,come on,kyle.I am not the only person herewho's peed in the pool.

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,010

57
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,470

What has happenedto this place

62
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,120
I don't recognize itanymore

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,280
it used to beso fun and special

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,230
What is lifeworth living for?

65
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,260
The dream is dead,our land is gone

66
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,680
There's a hole in my heart

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,770
And i can't go on

68
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,110
There are too manyminorities

69
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,670
Minorities

70
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,310
At my water park

71
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,830
my water park

72
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,940
This was our land,our dream

73
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,300
And they've takenit all away

74
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,640
They just keepcoming and coming Minorities

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,850
I tried to go and tell the police

76
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,130
But even the authorities

77
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,330
are minorities

78
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,490
At my water park

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,090
There's no place for meto sit anymore

80
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,180
and the lines just keepgetting crazier

81
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,180
There are mexicansall around me

82
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,450
The lazy riverhas never been lazier

83
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,470
it's a 40minute wait to godown one slide

84
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,480
And the instructions in spanishon the zipline ride

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,400
guarde sus brazos y piernasdentro del paseo siempre.

86
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,580
Just do it in english!

87
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,380
There are too manyminorities

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,900
too many

89
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,260
At my water park

90
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,400
somebody do something

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,050
Where did they allcome from?

92
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,010
Why can't they leavethis land alone?

93
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,820
And it's such a tragedy

94
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,240
Feel a bit like dying

95
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,710
We've been lookin'the other way too long

96
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,240
we've gotto change our priorities

97
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,500
and get all these minorities

98
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,650
Out of my water park

99
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,410
minorities

100
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,600
Mexicans and asians   black people

101
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,650
i think i even saw   a native american  gross.

102
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,470
God,i'm asking please,

103
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,920
Get all of these minorities

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,840
Out of my water park

105
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,910
My water park.

106
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,200
After this,you guys,wannahit the hurricane slides?

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,270
You bet!

108
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,560
I'm not getting backin the water.

109
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,610
Oh,come on,kyle.

110
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,500
Dude,i just found out thateverybody pees in pools.Why would i go back?

111
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,560
Not everybodypees in pools.

112
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,190
Do you pee in the pool?

113
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,680
Not today yet.

114
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960
Aw,come on!

115
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,320
Well dude,what are you gonna do?Just hang out hereat the table all day?

116
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,850
- Most likely.
- You guys!

117
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,420
You guys,we have got problemsof biblical proportions!

118
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,440
Dude,where have you been?

119
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,580
I've been counting.

120
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,230
Do you knowthere are 205 mexicans here?

121
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,330
And there are109 black people.

122
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,050
- So what?
- So.

123
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,700
Guesshow many white people are at the water parktoday?

124
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,540
143.

125
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,830
There are actually moreminorities here than us.

126
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,460
Well,then they're notminorities,are they?

127
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,000
What do you mean?

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,330
Dumb ass,if there's 60% of them to 40% of us,

129
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,420
then who's the minority?

130
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,030
The black and brown people.

131
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,480
No,you're the minority!

132
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,370
Do i look like a minorityto you,stupid?

133
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,280
Now look,guys,i did some calculations.

134
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,980
Just last year,there were almost 90% normal peopleto minorities.

135
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,700
That's a 50% risein one year.

136
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
This is more math thani've ever seen you do.

137
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,770
Because it's important!

138
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,260
A 50% rise each year means that in three years,

139
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,520
the world will be only minorities.

140
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,770
That's 2012.

141
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,110
- The mayans predicted this!
- The who?!

142
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,930
The mayans.They knew that minoritieswould take over the world by the year 2012.

143
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,150
And now it's happening!

144
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,310
I'm going to go onthe slides.

145
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,060
- Whoopie!
- You guys?

146
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,120
You guys,we have to dosomething to stop this!Come on!

147
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,230
Well,looks like at least you've got some senseleft in you,kyle.

148
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,730
So what are we going to doto keep the mayans prediction from coming true,buddy?

149
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,950
Blow it out your ass,cartman.

150
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,770
Eugene!That is disgusting!

151
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,430
Did you justpee in the pool?

152
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,760
Oh,come on!Look how big this pool is.

153
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,010
One person peeing in itisn't going to hurt anything.

154
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,820
Oh my god!

155
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,260
Ah,gentlemen,i am athe pipi.

156
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,060
How can i ahelp you?

157
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,830
Pipi,we have some dire newsconcerning your water park.

158
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,470
I've just finishedsome tests.

159
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,340
The water in your parkis now 98% pee.

160
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,760
Yes?So what's athe problem?

161
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,220
Pipi,you know thatacceptable pee levels in any water parkis 83%.

162
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,130
You have to shut down.

163
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,930
What?I can'ta close down.

164
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,760
Now it's my biggest aweekend!

165
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,010
Everyone is ahavingthe fun!

166
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,890
You're endangeringpeoples' lives!

167
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,710
If those pee levels hit 100%,there's no tellingwhat will happen.

168
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,020
And what proof do you havethat the pee levels will go up?

169
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,210
One in three people admitthey pee in pools.

170
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,000
Add another for people who dobut don't admit it,that's two in three.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,770
You've got just over500 people out there.

172
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,950
That's 332 people aboutto pee in your water.

173
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,540
Gentlemen,pleasea.

174
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,400
I comea from the venice.

175
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,030
Venice is almost all pee,

176
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,890
and we do just afine.

177
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,240
We swima in the pee,we singa in the pee.

178
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,030
You can't barge in here andtell me that i have to close down

179
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,190
just because my water parkhasa too much pee.

180
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,530
You haveto evacuate people now!

181
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,980
He said he's not doing it!

182
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,080
And as his lawyer,i advise you gentlemen,to leave and takeyour wild pee theories with you.

183
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,480
If one more personurinates in your pool,it could set offa chain reaction.

184
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,030
Then the pee will beon your hands.

185
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,200
Oh,boy,the waves arestartin' up again!

186
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,400
This is sweet,huh,kenny?

187
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,250
Wwhat's that?

188
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,070
It's pee!

189
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,610
Look out for the pee!

190
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,130
Gross!

191
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,240
It's athe pee!

192
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,700
Oh,my god.They killed kenny!

193
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,540
Aw,sick!

194
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,670
I wantthat entire water park contained and quarantineduntil i get some answers.

195
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,720
What's going on?

196
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,000
I told you peopleto keep civilians back!

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,220
Sir,please,my son is in there.What's happened?

198
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,560
We don't know yet,alright?

199
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,750
There's been a pee breachand a lot of people are dead.

200
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,870
Now,i'm sorry butyou're gonna have to

201
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,230
captain,these two men claimto know the situation.

202
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,460
We warnedthe owner of the park,but he refusedto shut down.

203
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,780
This was inevitable.

204
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,300
So this is all peerelated?

205
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,550
Yes.I tested the ph levelsthis morning.

206
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,630
And?

207
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,500
It was almost all pee,no h.

208
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Oh my god.

209
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,900
I've got to help him!

210
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,190
Stay back!

211
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,750
You can't just leave my sonin there with all that pee!

212
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,170
Sir,it's possiblewith a crane,we could helpany survivors out.

213
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,450
I think that would bea very bad idea.

214
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,780
And why is that?

215
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,010
Anyone inside there iscontaminated.

216
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,750
We have reason to believe that when people are exposedto that much pee,they change.

217
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,320
Change how?

218
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,800
Alright,bring inbring in the monkey.

219
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,580
We've only tested the theoryon monkeys so far.

220
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,910
This monkey is healthy andnormal in every way.

221
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,060
But now watch.

222
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,500
My god,he's becomefull of rage!

223
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,680
Kyle,quick!You gotta swim overto us.

224
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,820
No way!

225
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,040
You gotta swim over here,kyle.

226
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,450
Come on,kyle!

227
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,180
Dude,that's all pee!

228
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,840
Well,if you don't swim in it,you're gonna die.

229
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
I'll dieif i do swim in it.

230
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,800
Kyle,it's just pee.

231
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,070
It's not that big a deal.

232
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,590
Yes,it is a big deal!

233
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,550
Why do you thinkeveryone washes their hands after they goto the bathroom?

234
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,030
Well,not everyone washestheir hands after they goto the bathroom.

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,260
What?

236
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,410
Come on,dude,you gotta swim.

237
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,680
You don't wash your handsafter going to the bathroom?

238
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,650
Not.all the time.

239
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,080
That is gross!

240
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,030
Why?It's not like you're peeingon your hands.

241
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,200
There's more germson most furniture  than there is in pee.

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,100
Yeah,if anything,you should wash your handsbefore you touch your wiener.

243
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,590
Kyle,come on!

244
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,500
God dammit!

245
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,510
Do you needto wash your hands?

246
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,940
I can't hold on.

247
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,200
Help!

248
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,020
Help!

249
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,150
Here!Hey kid,grab this stick!

250
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,380
Yes!Yes,help me!

251
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,110
Yes,help me.I'm just a little boy.You have to help me.

252
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,910
Are you okay?

253
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,240
Yes.Thank you.

254
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,920
Well,what arewe gonna do now?

255
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,390
We've gotto just wait it out.

256
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,630
yeah,but for how long?

257
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,140
we need to find somethingto paddle with.

258
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,040
day one.It has happened.

259
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,440
The mayans were right.

260
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,670
Only thing they got wrongwas the date.

261
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,650
It is 2009 and i appear to bethe last of my species alive.

262
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,670
Now it's just me,all alone,with minorities.

263
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,610
What will the minoritiesdo with me?

264
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,280
I'm sure that's what's onall their minds.

265
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,180
I have to make myselfseem useful to them,or they willsurely not let me live.

266
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,350
Does anyone needmedical help?

267
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,400
I am a doctor.

268
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,040
Randy!Randy,calm down!

269
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,520
I can't understandwhat you're saying.

270
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,630
It's the pee!

271
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,150
It's all pee andnobody can go in or out!

272
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,840
What is all pee?

273
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,520
Sharon,the water parkhad a pee meltdown!

274
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,340
They think a lot of peoplehave died.

275
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,220
What?What about stan?Is he okay?

276
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,440
I don't know!

277
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,390
The whole water parkhas been quarantined.

278
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:18,920
They're worried anyoneleft alive could be some kind of raginghatefilled mutants!

279
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,730
Randy,you've got todo something!

280
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,170
Calm down,sharon.Calm down!

281
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,110
They're tryingto find an antidote.

282
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,360
Once they believethey can neutralize the enraging affectsof the pee,they'll.

283
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,530
They'll go into look for survivors.

284
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,360
I saidkeep the media out.

285
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,930
If the publichears about this,we'll have a fullscale panicon our hands.

286
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,700
Dammit!Where is that antidote?

287
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,960
Here!Here!

288
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,230
We think we have it,sir.

289
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,760
It's the bestwe could come up with in such a short time.

290
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,080
We aren't sureof the ramifications,

291
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,350
but it does appear to neutralizesome particles of the urine.

292
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,180
Alright,let's test it.Bring in the monkeys!

293
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,550
Let's hope to christthis works.

294
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,420
No,dammit no!

295
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,730
They're still angry!

296
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,070
This one's really angry.

297
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,050
It's out of control!

298
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,010
Find an antidotethat works!

299
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,550
Dude,why aren't peoplecoming to help us?

300
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,360
I don't know.

301
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,950
Oh why.

302
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,300
Why didn't pipi alisten?

303
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,100
They tried to warnathe pipi,but apipinot believe them.

304
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,280
Who are you?

305
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,980
Oh,i'm so sorry!

306
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,670
This is alla my fault!

307
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,510
I should haveashut my water park down when it reached90% apee!

308
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,470
Yeah.Well,people should know that peeing in poolsis bad!

309
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,560
But waita!Maybe you boysa cana help pipi.

310
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Ina the maintenance rooma,there isthe emergency release valve.

311
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,040
If you open it,alla this a peecan be lowered!

312
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,010
Okay!Where'sthe maintenance room?

313
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,600
That is athe problem.

314
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,830
The maintenance room is away down on the basement level.

315
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,180
I would do it,but pipi isa no good at athe swimming.

316
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,500
Somebody will haveto dive down into the pee,

317
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,960
then stay thereto turn the release wheel.

318
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,520
So who can holdatheir breath the longest?

319
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,650
- No!
- You said you can holdyour breath the longest,kyle.

320
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,860
Not in pee!

321
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,460
Pleaseayou have to hurry.

322
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,850
I'll draw youathe map and instructionshow to shut off athe valvea.

323
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,360
It'll be as easy asapeeing in the shower!

324
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,770
Oh,who peesin the shower?

325
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,900
Well,it's not like if yousuddenly have to pee,you're gonna getout of the shower.

326
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,190
Yeah,seeingall that running water always makes meneed to pee.

327
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,480
You don't peein the shower,dude!

328
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,730
That's fucking disgusting!

329
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,920
Boysa please!

330
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,680
We've got to get this boytoa that drainage valve or we're all agonna die.

331
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,620
Jesus christ!

332
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,260
It has been many,many hourssince the apocalypse,

333
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,590
And all i keep thinkingis "why me?

334
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,510
" why am i the only oneof my race god chose to survive in thisminorityrun world?

335
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,420
When the smokehas cleared,I'm sure the minoritieswill start rebuilding.

336
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,650
Building the worldin their way.

337
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,490
I can see it now.

338
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,860
No.

339
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,010
Alright,eric cartman.Let's hear your book report.

340
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,510
I read treasure island because i was so happywhen i saw that movie.

341
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,100
You're living in a minorityspeaking country now.

342
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,650
Say it right.

343
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,340
Because i was so happywhen i seen that movie.

344
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,470
Good.

345
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,500
No.

346
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,890
Trying to find a jobwill be even harder.

347
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,170
You don't expect to makethe same amount of money that minorities make,do you?

348
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,630
Well,i do justas much work.

349
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,180
You're trash around here.

350
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,780
You'll never make as muchas a minority.

351
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,730
No.

352
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,930
Eventually,the minorities willdo away with me all together.

353
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,200
All those in favor of puttingwhite people in camps?

354
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,260
aye!

355
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,840
All those opposed?

356
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,680
No.

357
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,100
The minorities win!

358
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,580
No!No,i don't want to live in your world,do you understand?

359
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,550
Your world is cold and voidof any humanity.

360
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,990
Just kill me.Kill me now!

361
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,850
Do it!

362
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,780
Okay,there

363
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,790
we are almostaready for the diving.

364
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,540
Now if you run aintothe any problems,

365
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,600
you just tug athree timeson the cableAnd apipi will apull you backato the surface.

366
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,980
Let's just getthis over with.

367
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,420
You got a the mapa andapipi's instructions.

368
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,460
- Yes.
- Good.

369
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,790
Now justaone last thing.

370
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,930
- You needto drink somea pee.
- What?

371
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,330
- You just need to drink abouta three cupsa pee.
- Why?

372
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,940
You swim a downadeep in the pee,you get athe pressure.The benza!

373
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,700
You have to fill the inside ofyour body with some apee to compensate.

374
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,630
That's true,dude.Didn't you see the abyss?

375
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,770
I am not.

376
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,150
Not drinking pee.

377
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,490
But only you can aholdthe breath a long time to swim downand release athe valve anda

378
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,170
If you get a the benza,then you a fail and we all adie!

379
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,870
- Just drink the pee,kyle.
- Please,kyle.I wanna go home.

380
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,240
What's athe problem?

381
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,840
When ayou pee,either inthe toilet or in athe shower,it all goes to the sewer.

382
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,270
The sewer all agoesto the ocean.

383
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,790
The ocean is the waterwe all adrink.

384
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,440
You are alwaysdrinking the pee!

385
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,110
That doesn't make mefeel better!

386
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,820
I wouldn't even be ableto keep it down.

387
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,650
*********You drank only peefor nine months when you lived inayour mother's belly.

388
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,190
No!

389
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,310
Make way!Make way!I need to speakto the fire marshal!

390
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,640
Sir!Sir,i just got off the phonewith my colleagues at the university.

391
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,800
They've also been testingantidotes on monkeys.

392
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,360
They're claiming thatthey've had success,using simple musa acuminata.

393
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,130
Wait.You mean a banana.

394
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,230
- Yes.
- Is it possible?

00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,560
but this antidotehasn't yet been tested on a human.

402
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,630
I'll do it.

403
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,670
You can testthe antidote on me.

404
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,540
