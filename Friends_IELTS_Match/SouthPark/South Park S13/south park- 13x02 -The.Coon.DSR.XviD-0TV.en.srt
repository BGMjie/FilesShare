4
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,710
<i>CRIME RATE UP</i>

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,100
The city isn't what
it used to be --

6
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,930
It all happened so fast.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,310
Everything went to crap.

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,490
It's like everyone's sense
of morals just disappeared.

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,720
The bad economy made things worse.

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,520
The jobs started drying up.

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,670
Then the stores had to shut down.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,890
Then the black man
was elected president.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,740
He was supposed to
change things. He didn't.

14
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,450
As more and more people turn to crime and
violence,the town becomes gripped in fear.

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,770
Dark times. This city needs protection.

16
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,140
There is an animal that lives by night.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,330
Searches through trash cans
and cleans out the garbage.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,080
To clean the trash can of society,I've
chosen to become more than a man.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,550
I am the hero this town needs.

20
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,170
I am --
the coon.

21
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,810
As the world plummets into despair,the
coon fights to keep order intact.

22
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,000
Lisa,i had a really great time tonight.

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,490
I did too,josh.

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,240
Would you mind very
much if I kissed you?

25
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,480
Not at all.

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,660
A woman being raped.

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,830
This is what our city
has been reduced to.

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,010
When the money goes the raping starts.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,760
Women are helpless without the coon.

30
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,740
Oh,yes,josh! Yes!

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,870
Let her go!

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,430
Excuse me?

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,770
You aren't raping anyone tonight!

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,110
Oh,it's a talking squirrel.

35
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,370
Oat out of here! Get to safety!

36
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,600
Lisa! Call me!

37
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,750
Another woman saved from rape.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,700
But how many more rapists are out there?

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,000
That really stings.

40
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,880
Here's the file on that
rodriguez case,detective.

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,940
All right. Things are
pretty quiet out there,boys.

42
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,050
Let's try to get caught
up on our paperwork.

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,410
Murphy,i
want you to --

44
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,220
don't let the city's peacefulness
fool you,commissioner.

45
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,790
It's too quiet.

46
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,620
Oh,not this kid again.

47
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,240
Hey,you get outta here. Out!

48
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,460
There was another rapist
in the park tonight.

49
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,820
It's no coincidence.

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,500
It must be a rapist plot
and it stinks to the top.

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,020
What?

52
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,700
I think the mayor might be involved.

53
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,180
It's my theory she has a lesbian
lover who's holder her leash.

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,570
Jesus christ. Can't we
get a lock on that window?

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,270
Look,kid,you
need to stop --

56
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,120
he's gone.

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,800
No,I'm just over here now.

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,930
What do we know about the
mayor's sexual preferences?

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,780
All right,listen.

60
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,410
You have five seconds to leave or I'm
gonna put you in jail and call your parents.

61
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,440
Jail's full,sir.

62
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,750
Whatever.Then
we'll put you in --

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
now I'm back over here.

64
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,580
Just get out of
here before we --

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,650
I'm right here now.

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,460
All right. Stop it!

67
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,040
Yes,i have to go now.

68
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,760
But in the meantime,i have
something that might interest you.

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,180
Make sure all your men get
a look at these,detective.

70
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,340
What's in here

71
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,200
hey,guys. Good morning.

72
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,890
You guys hear that another rape victim
got saved by a superhero last night?

73
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,180
They say it was the coon.

74
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,380
Who's the coon?

75
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,320
I know,right? Who is the coon?

76
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,230
It's what everyone must
be asking themselves.

77
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,590
Somebody is dressing up at night and
taking the law into their own hands.

78
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,420
As for me,i certainly don't agree
with the coon's reckless ways.

79
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,290
If you ask me,there's no room
in this world for vigilantes.

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,940
I believe the coon is a menace.

81
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,380
Yeah,and dressing up and running
around at night is faggy anyway.

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,520
You're a fag,kyle! You!

83
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,430
- Dude,what?
- He's not a fag!

84
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,590
Why do you care?

85
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:39,190
I,well,I'm just mad 'cuz you shouldn't
ever use the term "fag," kyle.

86
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,260
That's a hate word and it's
insensitive to butt pirates.

87
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,630
Anyway,what the you think
about the coon,stan and kenny?

88
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,060
Do you think he's the savior this town needs,or
do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?

89
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,210
Kenny?

90
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,790
And of course the most
common question asked is --

91
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,090
Just who is he? Is
he a hero or a menace?

92
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,070
While we can all admit that the
coon is obviously really cool,

93
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,160
We should also be asking each other why does
he care so much for the people of this town?

94
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,420
Why does he sacrifice himself every
night to rid our streets of crime?

95
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,080
And does he really have the right?

96
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,960
What we all need
to know -- clyde.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,970
Clyde,could you wake
up,please. This is important.

98
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,410
What we all need now is
proof that the coon exists.

99
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,270
I believe that tonight,from
approximately 5:00 to 5:45,

100
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,520
The coon is going to be
on the roof of walgreens.

101
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,110
I know i'll be there with my camera.

102
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,950
I'm sure many of you will,too.

103
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,000
Sometimes it seems the more
criminals I try to stop,

104
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,410
The more just come out of the
back alleys and dilapidated bars.

105
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,360
The city is a dying whore.

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,120
She calls out to me to save her.

107
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,920
And I don't know if I can.

108
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,660
But she is still my city.

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,420
And I cannot just sit and
watch as innocent people are --

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,710
who the hell is that?

111
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,170
Who the hell are you?

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,620
I am an angel keeping watch
over the city at night.

113
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,970
As violence and darkness take over the
streets,i work to rid the streets of crime.

114
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,600
I am the symbol this town needs.

115
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,610
No,no,no. I'm the
symbol this town needs.

116
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,380
Dude,seriously,you can't do that.
Go home. I was doing this first.

117
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,050
Yeah-huh!

118
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,210
You heard of the coon and
now you're being a copycat.

119
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,010
Is that your hero name? Copycat?

120
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,590
I am mysterion.

121
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,560
Mysterion? That's retarded.

122
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,410
You just gave yourself away,craig.

123
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,160
Only you would think
of a name that dumb.

124
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,700
I might be craig,an then
again I might not be.

125
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,520
My identity must remain a secret.

126
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,580
You cannot know.

127
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,260

I cannot stand here and make
idle conversation any longer.

137
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,830
The city needs my help. There
are innocents to protect.

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,700
No! Dude,I'm serious. You're
being a copycat! I'll sue you!

139
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,490
Mother!

140
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,610
Which one of them is it?

141
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,170
Somebody is dressing up and
pretending to be a superhero,but who?

142
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,180
Has to be one of the guys in my class,'cuz only they
know the coon would be on the rooftop of the walgreens.

143
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,660
No. Stop. Can't think about
that now. I have to focus.

144
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,340
Tomorrow is the most important
day in the coon's life.

145
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,040
Everything the coon has lived and
fought for comes down to tomorrow.

146
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,700
Concentrate

147
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,880
how is it that nobody
came to coonicon '09?

148
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,090
This is just --
this is ridiculous!

149
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,990
Got everything you need here,sir?

150
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,200
Okay on beverages,buffett items?

151
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,950
Yes,it's fine.

152
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,910
Great. Hey,just want to say that the airport
hilton really appreciates your continued business.

153
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,420
What do you mean "continued"?
You don't know who I am.

154
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,770
Aren't you the little boy who had his ginger
pride rally and his aids benefit here before?

155
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,200
No! I'm not that kid!

156
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,490
Oh,really? My bad.

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,660
I'm actually relieved. That
kid was kind of a douche bag.

158
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,050
You're a douche bag!Get out of here

159
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,460
oh,hello,sweetie. What did you do today?

160
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,410
I got boned. That's what I did,mom!

161
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,220
I try to do good stuff
and nobody ever notices.

162
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,830
Oh,what happened,hon?

163
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,660
I can't tell you what happened,'cuz
it's about my super secret double life!

164
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,770
Tonight,an incredible story of
an unknown child in south park

165
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,220
Who has taken to the streets
in an effort to fight crime.

166
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,090
What?

167
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,360
But who exactly is mysterion?

168
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,970
What?

169
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,890
Curiosity has led to large crowds in
the mountain town of south park,colorado.

170
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,980
They've brought binoculars,and cameras to try
and get a shot of the mysterious superhero.

171
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,430
He was dressed mostly in
black with a kind of cloak.

172
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,480
He jumped down from the fire escape
stairs and then he just ran off.

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,910
We barely got a look at him.

174
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,930
To me it looked like mysterion to me.

175
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,170
Everyone who seen mysterion say yeah!

176
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,810
Yeah!

177
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,230
Well,i think he's kind of a
symbol for the town,you know?

178
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,240
A symbol that everyone who's
sick of crime can rally behind.

179
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,100
Butthole.

180
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,070
Well,if you ask me,he's a menace.

181
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,010
There's no room for
vigilantism in today's world.

182
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,410
The artist rendition of mysterion has
already generated thousands of copies.

183
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,260
You've got to be kidding me!

184
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,860
As hundreds of people gather to try and get a
glimpse of the superhero,one question remains --

185
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,760
Who is mysterion?

186
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Who is mysterion? Who
is he? Who could he be?

187
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,050
If you have any idea about
the true identity of  *******

188
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,850
<i>Who is mysterion?</i>

189
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,500
I could no longer watch as the
city has become a cesspool of crime.

190
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,750
I lived in south park all my life.

191
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,250
I decided it was up to
me to keep town safe.

192
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,490
Nobody at school knows my double life.

193
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,380
To them,I'm just another fourth grader.

194
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,750
But tonight,i am mysterion.

195
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,730
Ah,mysterion,thank god you've come.

196
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,250
What news do you have?

197
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,230
There's some graffiti
on the bridge again.

198
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,160
I think those sixth
grade kids are doing it.

199
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,970
And the guy at the movie theater
is harassing mexicans again.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,690
We'll get right on it,mysterion.

201
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,650
Thank you. Thank you for all your help.

202
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,000
Godspeed,mysterion!

203
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,100
You are a beecon of hope in an
otherwise bleak and dreary world!

204
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,230
Dude,seriously.

205
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,990
I'm gonna kick the out
of you if you don't stop.

206
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,470
The city needs my help.

207
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,780
It cries for
protection and I will --

208
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,680
answer the call to save her!
That's what I'm supposed to say!

209
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,360
I know it's you,kyle. So just stop.

210
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,260
I don't have time for this.

211
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,230
Fireworks are illegal
in colorado,you asshole!

212
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,390
Hey,he's got fireworks!

213
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,570
So guys,any of you do anything
interesting last night?

214
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
- Not really.
- Really?

215
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,790
Nobody was playing with any fireworks?

216
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,520
Dude,what the hell?

217
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,590
Kenny! I should have known!

218
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,550
Why do you have a picture of
mysterion in your locker,kenny?

219
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,580
Unless you are mysterion!

220
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,580
Dude,i have a picture of
mysterion in my locker,too.

221
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,610
Yeah,so do i.

222
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,640
What? Why?

223
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,330
I don't know. It's just a cool costume.

224
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,920
It's not a cool costume!

225
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,980
He just wears his
underwear over his pants!

226
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,950
Now come on! Which
one of you guys is it?

227
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,370
How are you so sure mysterion is a boy?

228
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,640
Bitch.

229
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,490
<i>U-STOR-IT
STORAGE FACILITY</i>

230
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,500
I had no choice. I was
at the end of my rope.

231
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,730
Sometimes when a superhero needs answers,he has
to turn to on the wretched underbelly of society.

232
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,530
Look what the cat dragged in.

233
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,270
Come out where I can see you.

234
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,550
What's the matter,coon? Nervous?

235
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,050
I didn't want to resort to this.

236
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,520
But you could have the answers I need.

237
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,590
How utterly delightful.

238
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,890
The heroic and mighty coon

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,180
come to put a stop to me again.

240
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,650
Chaos. I need to keep on my toes.

241
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm not here to stop
you this time,chaos.

242
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,110
I need information.

243
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,180
Oh,I'm sure you do.

244
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,270
But you see
I -- wugh!

245
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,280
But you see I also know
you like to beat me up.

246
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,170
I didn't call you to fight,chaos.

247
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,390
I came to see if you
know mysterion's identity.

248
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,730
Oh,I'm close!

249
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,530
And i'll put an end to him and
all of you goodie two shoe heroes.

250
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,170
I'm not on his side.

251
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,540
Do you think I'm a fool?

252
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,010
All those times you've stopped
me from my acts of evil.

253
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,010
All those times you tricked me into
meeting you and then gave me titty-twisters!

254
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,770
Not this time,coon.

255
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,890
I finally learned my lesson.

256
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,030
Now! General disarray!

257
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,850
Yeah!

258
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,410
Oho,careful,general disarray.

259
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,590
Stop! You little butthole,knock it off!

260
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,960
Yeah! We beat him,general disarray!

261
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,080
Listen to me!

262
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,980
I want to help you get rid of mysterion.

263
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,810
Let him go,general disarray.

264
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,810
Why would you help us?

265
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,410
Because mysterion
is trying to -- ugh!

266
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,830
Little! That hurt!

267
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,930
Because mysterion is trying to
say he's the hero this town needs.

268
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,440
But that's my job.

269
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,320
But you both fight for justice and good.

270
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,700
Yeah,but he's a dick.

271
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,530
I want him gone just as much as you do.

272
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Very well.

273
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,270
I will show you what we know
about mysterion's identity.

274
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,570
But if this is some
kind of set-up --

275
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,680
look,I'm the good guy,chaos.I
don't betray people.

276
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,650
Oh,yeah.

277
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,870
I didn't like working with this
scumbag,but I knew mysterion was out there.

278
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,220
Plotting his next move.

279
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,080
Hello,kyle.

280
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,510
What
the --

281
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,070
do not be afraid.I mean you no harm.

282
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,430
Hey,hey,you're that mysterion kid!

283
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,610
Yes,but now I believe someone is
trying to learn my true identity.

284
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,490
Dude,everyone's trying
to figure out who you are!

285
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,690
I cannot be unmasked,for then
I would stop being a symbol.

286
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,680
I need help.

287
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,120
Somebody who can do background
checks for me,do some investigating.

288
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,150
Who? Me? Why?

289
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,060
Because I think you are
the smartest kid in class.

290
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,030
This way!

291
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,180
We will now show you our
secret headquarters of doom!

292
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,280
You guys have your own storage facility?

293
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,660
Actually,it belongs to general
disarray's grandma,but she lets us use it.

294
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,930
This is where we come up
with al our evil plans!

295
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,300
Here's our computer relays.

296
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,580
And this is like a cube of chaos that
can destroy the world in one second.

297
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,840
And here's some of our evil minions.

298
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,000
We have everything we need here!

299
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,760
Can I offer you a coke
or a sprite or something?

300
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,740
I'll take a sprite.

301
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,340
Get the coon a sprite,general disarray.

302
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,060
As you can see,we too have been
working hard on mysterion's identity.

303
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,650
You have an entire wall
dedicated to mysterion?

304
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,000
What about -- do you still have that
"who is the coon" t-shirt I gave you?

305
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,900
Oh,yeah. I think that's
around here somewhere.

306
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,400
Using our photos,we are trying
to pinpoint mysterion's identity.

307
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,660
Why is cartman crossed
out? He could be mysterion.

308
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,050
No,he's too fat.

309
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,600
Based on his body type,it's gotta
be someone like stan or kyle.

310
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,630
All right,all right,look,chaos.

311
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,330
Just set up a video camera.

312
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,840
I know how we can put an end
to mysterion once and for al >

313
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,600
The clock is ticking and the citizens
of south park are gripped in fear.

314
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,910
Two days ago,an evil unknown
terrorist threatened major consequences

315
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,080
if mysterion does not
reveal his identity.

316
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,930
Mark my words,south park!

317
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,530
Your precious hero is now your undoing!

318
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,460
If mysterion does not unmask
himself publicly by wednesday night,

319
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,960
i am going to blow
up a hospital --

320
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,690
Blow up a hospital? I'm not
gonna blow up any hospital!

321
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,890
Are you nuts? What?

322
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,130
Uh,the choice is yours,mysterion.

323
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,130
Unmask yourself or hundreds will die.

324
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,640
Jesus christ.

325
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,060
Since the threat was issued there
has been no sign of the mysterion.

326
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,480
Where is mysterion?

327
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,180
Where is mysterion?

328
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,770
Hey,coon. We aren't actually
going to blow up anything,are we?

329
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,320
If you don't make good on your
threats,chaos,then what good are your threats?

330
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,400
But you really won't
to blow up a hospital?

331
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,270
I mean,aren't you a good guy?

332
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,660
Sometimes blowing up hospitals
is for the greater good,chaos.

333
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,320
You know I've been thinking.

334
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,280
If we're really evil villains,then we should
betray him and blow him up with the hospital.

335
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,520
You know,you're a little
scrotum licker,dude.

336
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,520
Why don't you shut the up?

337
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,730
All right,chaos. I'm gonna get the
triggers for these things at ace hardware.

338
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,100
Keep an eye on this stuff.

339
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,640
Oh,jeez. General disarray,this is a
lot more than I ever really intended.

340
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:56,110
I mean,i hate the world and all its puny inhabitants
and all,but blowing up a hospital just seems mean

341
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,630
Oh,hamburgers!

342
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,460
Mysterion,ibudduh,ibuddush,hebba,hebba
--

343
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,790
why are you doing this?

344
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,860
This isn't your usual m.o.,chaos.

345
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,490
Well,you bubba,i was just -- and then the
coon showed up and he was isa abuduh abdudh --

346
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,980
What is that?

347
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Look!

348
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,310
Mysterion and professor
chaos are fighting.

349
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,150
Give him hell,mysterion!

350
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,930
Look out,mysterion. General
disarray is behind you!

351
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,360
Jesus christ. We need backup out here!

352
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,780
I think I can get a shot at chaos,sir!

353
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,270
You think your bullets can hurt him?

354
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,190
Yeah! We did it!

355
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,210
He's dead. Mysterion is dead!

356
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,120
No!

357
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,330
The impossible has happened.

358
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,380
Mysterion,beloved protector
of the city,is dead.

359
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,170
Who will save us now?

360
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,890
Wait! Look!

361
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,370
He's all right!

362
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,970
Oh,my god! Look,everyone! It's the coon!

363
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,550
Fear not,everyone.

364
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,430
The coon is here to save the day!

365
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,990
Isn't that bruce vilanch?

366
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,260
Be careful,bruce vilanch. There's
super humans fighting right over there.

367
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,850
Okay,sorry. Sorry. I
give up. Please,i give up.

368
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,290
Don't worry,mysterion.

369
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,040
The coon will now help you.

370
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,750
Whoa,wait! I thought we
were working together --

371
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,870
Oh,jeez. I think I broke a tooth.

372
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,270
That was great teamwork,mysterion.

373
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,150
South park is safe,until next time.

374
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,250
What next time?

375
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,160
Well,people are obviously so desperate to
learn your identity that they'll do anything.

376
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,480
Won't be long before the next villain comes along
and threatens violence unless you take off your mask.

377
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,910
Citizens,tonight has shown me that I
have no choice,but to unmask myself.

378
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,670
Don't do it,mysterion!

379
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,480
If you show your identity,we'll be forced
to arrest you for being a vigilante.

380
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,930
Don't you think he knows that?

381
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,720
But superheroes know that sometimes you have
to sacrifice yourself for the greater good!

382
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,870
Don't show your face,mysterion.

383
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,720
You have to be a symbol!

384
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,840
So that the next terrorist can threaten
south park if he doesn't unmask himself?

385
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,560
No,it's true.

386
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,230
As long as my identity is a mystery,this
will just happen again and again.

387
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,380
It has to end. I will show my face.

388
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,150
Well,i'll be.

389
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,840
I knew it was you! Rember
I even said it before!

390
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,200
Wow,a kid from my class was mysterion.

391
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,730
Well,I'm sorry,but you're under arrest.

392
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,040
Take the kid to jail.

393
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,140
My entire plan worked to perfection.

394
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,910
My work here is done.

395
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,780
With mysterion out of the way,the coon can
finally go back to keeping the city safe.

396
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,250
Once again,i alone am the symbol
this town can stand behind.

397
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,300
Every town needs a hero.

398
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,310
Every town needs a coon.

399
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:43,810
