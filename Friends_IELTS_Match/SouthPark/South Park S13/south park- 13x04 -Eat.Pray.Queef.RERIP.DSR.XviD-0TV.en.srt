00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,790
Oh,man,i thought that
day would never end!

5
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,910
Hey,stan,you wanna maybe
study together after school?

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,100
What? No way,wendy. Today's the day!

7
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,950
What day?

8
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,820
The day they're showing part two of
last week's terrence and phillip show!

9
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,600
They're gonna finally reveal who
phillip farted on to get out of jail!

10
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,250
Oh,god,that show is so dumb.

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,720
Dumb?Phillip farted in
somebody's face super hard,

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,920
but you don't know who
until this week's episode!

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,330
This has been the
longest week of my life!

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,280
Why do boys think farts are so funny?

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,750
They're juvenile and gross!

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,820
No,no,you're right,be.
Farts totally aren't funny.

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,480
C'mon,guys. We gotta go!

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,720
We're finally gonna learn the shocking
truth of who phillip farted on.

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,280
Let's get to my house. C'mon!

20
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,930
God,they're so stupid.

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,560
- Oh,boy.
- This is gonna be great!

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,580
I've waited all week for this.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,100
That's my seat,craig.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,260
Dude,i was here first.

25
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,950
It's my goddamn house. Now get
your bitch ass on the floor!

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,210
It's on! It's on! It's
on! It's on! It's on!

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,050
You are watching the canada channel.

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,180
The only channel in canada.

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,450
previously on "terrance and phillip" -

30
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,360
Terrance farted on the american
president,but phillip took the heat.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,980
It wasn't me!

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,370
And now the thrilling conclusion
of "terrance and blood rage" --

33
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,030
Will not be seen tonight.

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,850
So that we may bring you
this queef sisters special!

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,660
<i>APRIL FOOLS</i>

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,830
What?

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,970
Canada channel presents.
The queef sisters.

38
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,370
Katherine and katie queef.

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,460
Two toronto girls who love
shooting air out of their vaginas.

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,290
It's a queef sisters
special on canada channel.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,480
All right,queef sisters. It's time
for your yearly pap smear and vag exam.

42
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,330
- All right,doctor.
- I'm ready,doctor.

43
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,790
Now,i'm just going to check for cysts.

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,300
What the is this?

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,460
Now listen here!

46
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,730
If you queef in my face then i
refuse to be your gynecologist.

47
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,540
I'm sorry,doctor. I had
air trapped in my vagina.

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,400
Well,just don't let it happen again.

49
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,710
Now,i'm just going to check for cysts.

50
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,510
Now stop it. That isn't
funny. Babies come from there!

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,420
That's it. No pap smear for you.

52
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,120
But,doctor,what if i have cancer?

53
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,570
You should have thought of that before
you queefed in my face three times.

54
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,060
They,they aren't going to show part
two of the "terrance and phillip show"?

55
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,230
Doctor,my sister is
just being difficult.

56
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,720
Maybe you could just
examine my cervix instead?

57
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,540
Oh,all right. Let me check for cysts.

58
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,060
No!

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,450
That does it,queef sisters.

60
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,890
I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore!

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,040
Oh,katie,i do believe
we made the doctor angry.

62
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,950
I guess so.

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,120
Dude,what the hell is
this disgusting crap?

64
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,140
What the the hell is
this disgusting crap?

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,370
Queef sisters?

66
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,990
That's right. It's a hot new
canadian show we're trying out.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,930
You replaced our show with this?

68
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,010
But they aren't funny.

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,460
All they do is queef all the time.

70
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,720
That's sick!

71
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,830
You think farts are
funny, why not queefs?

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,610
Because babies come from there!

73
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,760
Ay,look,guys.

74
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,350
Women are starting to be on the driving
force behind the television audience.

75
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,130
You know,women empowerment and the get-go,be so
we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility.

76
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,710
Sorry,guys,but if you ask me,
your farts have gotten stale.

77
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,550
No! No,as a matter of
fact,i will not hold!

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,000
I've been hold for 35 minutes!

79
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,230
Well,we want some goddamn ed
answers,that's what we want!

80
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,840
Like why did you show that smut instead of the
"terrance and phillip" conclusion,you asshole!

81
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,890
What's going on?

82
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,270
We're complaing to the canada network
'cuz they put something really gross on tv.

83
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,960
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women
shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?

84
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,830
No! No! See some of us were
eating when you showed that!

85
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,230
I threw up on my way home.

86
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,520
Clyde threw up on his way home!

87
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,200
What makes you think you can put
that kind of filth on television?

88
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,510
You tell 'em,cartman!

89
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,500
What happened?

90
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,660
They didn't show part two
of "terrance and phillip."

91
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,910
They replaced it with the queef sisters.

92
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,720
It was just 30 minutes of
two women queefing on people.

93
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,510
Oh,what,so farts are
hysterical but queefs are gross?

94
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,230
You know little kids could
have been watching that!

95
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,780
What kind of network are
you running there in canada?

96
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,620
Don't call me "buddy."
I'm not your buddy!

97
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,740
I can't believe they're this upset.

98
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,870
God,they're annoying.

99
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,260
I don't even know what a queef is.

100
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,370
It's when a woman blows
air out her vag,annie.

101
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,230
You know that girl samantha dunskin,she
can make herself queef whenever she wants.

102
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,340
Really?

103
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,470
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.

104
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,330
And to that end,by resorting to filth and
garbage,the canada channel has thusly -

105
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,790
Robbed us of our innocence.

106
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,840
Yes,that's good.

107
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,070
Robbed us of us innocence.

108
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,580
Hey,guys,we have a
little surprise for you!

109
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,180
What?

110
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,860
Butters?

111
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,390
Oh,my god. Well,how is he doing?

112
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,210
Yeah,yeah,i'm sure.

113
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,950
Okay,well,thank you for telling
me,mr. Stotch. I'll spread the word.

114
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,170
Yeah,you take care. Bye.

115
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,320
We need to cancel our plans, sharon.

116
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,270
There's going to be an emergency
all-parent meeting at the school tonight.

117
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,850
Why? What's happened?

118
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,230
A girl at school,she queefed
on one of stan's friends today.

119
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,600
So ?

120
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,340
hey,pal.

121
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,320
I heard about what
happened at school today.

122
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,350
You wanna talk about it?

123
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,260
Butters was just sitting there,dad.

124
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,310
He,he didn't even know it was coming.

125
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,590
I know,pal.

126
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,860
Sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

127
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,690
But,you know,butters is still butters.

128
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,160
And he needs you guys
right now more than anybody.

129
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,230
It was so gross,dad.

130
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,720
It mean what if another
girl at school tries to --

131
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,820
Hey,we're getting all the parents together
and we're gonna take care of this,okay?

132
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,440
Nothing like this
will ever happen again.

133
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,230
Okay,parents,some of you have already
heard,but most of you have not,mkay.

134
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,040
We've had a terrible
incident occur at the school.

135
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,260
Apparently a young girl went up to
a young boy here at the school,mkay,

136
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,290
and queefed in his face.

137
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,800
How did this happen?

138
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,100
Where were the teachers?

139
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,180
Whoa,whoa,wait a minute.

140
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,100
Are you saying we're all here just
because a girl queefed on a boy?

141
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,140
Just?

142
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,880
We're here to find out why!

143
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,290
The question is how do we send a message to other
girls in the school so this doesn't happen again?

144
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,790
Now hold on a minute. I think
we're being a little drastic here.

145
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,820
You know,i probably see a boy in my
office once a week for farting on a girl.

146
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,210
What the was that have
to do with anything?

147
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,120
- It's the same thing!
- This is ridiculous!

148
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,580
Our next guests have really
taken america by storm.

149
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,750
Their new hit show is being tuned
in by women all over the world.

150
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,100
Please welcome the queef sisters.

151
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,300
Oh,hello,regis!

152
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,860
Hello,kelly!

153
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,670
So,uh,gals,you seem to
really like queefing.

154
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,190
Well,reeg,it's like this.

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,670
We think that queefing is a perfectly
normal female bodily function.

156
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,380
Why not have fun with it?

157
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,520
But i mean,really,isn't
queefing a bit juvenile?

158
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,380
Men enjoy farts,so why shouldn't
women enjoy their queefs?

159
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,460
That's right.

160
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,670
We've written all about it in our
new feminist book "eat, pray,queef."

161
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,160
Well,i think what you gals are doing
for the feminist movement is amazing!

162
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,400
And that's why women all
over america stand behind you!

163
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,490
No!

164
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,740
Terrance and phillip,you've put on
a terrific show for many, many years.

165
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,790
You've made canada
channel what it is today.

166
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,990
You're fired.

167
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,340
Fired?

168
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,700
Sorry,guys,but this queefing
thing is really catching on.

169
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,340
Queef sisters ratings
are through the roof.

170
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,840
And to pay them what they're asking,we
gotta get rid of you. Goodbye.

171
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,740
Here's some cookies.

172
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,120
Brian,don't do this!

173
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,240
You can't let canada channel be
soiled by that perverse garbage!

174
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,090
You know it's sick!

175
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,260
Yes,i know it's sick.

176
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,650
To be honest,i gag every time
one of them let's out a queef.

177
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,040
But it's money,goddammit,and
this channel needs it.

180
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,620
i always love when spring is on the way.

181
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,950
Such a fun and inspiring
time to decorate.

182
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,610
Just like most women out there, i
have really got into queefing lately.

183
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,960
There are a lot of fun and interesting
ways that we can decorate our queefs,

184
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,520
And just make them more
dynamic for the holidays.

185
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,060
What we're going to do is just
cut up some paper. Like this.

186
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:32,210
You can cut out little stars or little
moon shapes and then just jam those up.

187
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,700
And then i've got some just simple
sparkles from the hobby store.

188
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,180
They come in these little tubes, which make
them very easy to just shoot right up the ol' --

189
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
There we are.

190
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,820
And you can of course feel free to add little
flowers,or maybe some festive easter grass.

191
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,480
But the point is that when
we're done,we can let one rip.

192
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,230
See how pretty that was?

193
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,420
It's a good thing

194
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,420
what was that?

195
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,350
Oh,excuse me. I had
a little air trapped.

196
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,490
Oh,my god. Did you
just -- at the table?

197
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,050
Pardon me.

198
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,570
Mom,gross.

199
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,610
Okay,that's enough,girls, all right?

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,290
I mean,how old are you,sharon?

201
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,910
I'm sorry. It's just,it's kind
of funny how much it bothers you.

202
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,480
Oh,yeah. Yeah,that's really funny.

203
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,270
Just stop it,mom.

204
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,150
Yeah,okay,let's just try
to have a nice dinner. Okay?

Excuse me.

Hey mom,do you like australia?

'Cuz that was a great barrier queef!

210
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,670
That's it. I'm leaving.

211
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,930
I'm going,too.

212
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,660
Oh,please,randy!

213
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,110
How many times have you farted in the bed
and then held my head under the covers?

214
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,690
That's completely different!

215
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,890
Yeah,it's different,mom!

216
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,590
All right. Tell me
exactly where the line is.

217
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,400
Okay,how about this?
I have a friend abbey.

218
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,900
She had a baby boy and it farted.

219
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,370
Yeah.

220
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,330
But she was actually still pregnant with
the baby boy and it farted inside her.

221
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,310
Yeah!

222
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,770
And then the gas from the baby's fart
traveled down and shot out of her vagina!

223
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,680
C'mon,stanley. Let's go.

224
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,540
Oh,so when does that stop being funny?

225
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,940
It stopped being funny the second
that air came out her vagina,sharon!

226
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,230
Look,katherine. I made queef cookies!

227
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,600
But those are just ginger snaps,katie.

228
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,970
Could you get that,katie?

229
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,590
Oh,my god. Look,katherine!

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,410

such an honor to meet you.

Oh,katie,i'm getting all
goosebumpy and queefy.

May we come in,please.

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,420
Oh,certainly. Though i
fear we do look a mess.

Oh,yes. The show is going
about as well as it could!

All right! Enough with the queefing!

240
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,630
We didn't come for a social call.

241
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,690
That's right. We've come to kill you.

242
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,990
Why kill us? We love you!

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,830
Because you've reduced canada
channel to smut and toilet humor!

244
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,110
Well,i suppose if we're going to die,we
should die by the hands of our idols.

245
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,960
Your idols?

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,620
We grew up watching you.

247
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,040
You meant the world to us.

248
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,710
We used to fantasize about
pleasing you in all different ways.

249
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,780
Know that it is an honor
to die by your hand.

250
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,910
I don't think i can do it, phillip.

251
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,560
Why not?

252
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
Because i'm suddenly finding myself
strangely attracted to katherine.

253
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,790
What? That's crazy,terrance.

254
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,190
Katie is obviously the hot one.

255
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,790
Hey,butters. How you holding up,man?

256
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,130
Aw,hey,fellas.

257
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,710
We got you a present, butters.

258
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,100
I'll put it here on your nightstand,'cuz none
of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,440
Aw,thanks.

260
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,620
Butters,i'm afraid
things have gotten worse.

261
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,850
All the women suddenly
think that queefing is funny.

262
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,650
Calm down,butters. The
men are taking action.

263
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,100
But we need to take your picture.

264
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,590
My picture?

265
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,800
You're going to be the
face of queef abuse,butters.

266
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,130
So that we can make
people open their eyes.

A disgusting and violating trend is
taking over our city, our state,our nation.

277
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,070
Queefing has become an acceptable evil.

278
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,070
Last week at our school,a girl
queefed right into our friend's face.

279
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,220
That is why we are here to
tell you it's not a joke.

On television,us children are starting to
see and hear more and more graphic queefing.

281
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,910
I would like to take this opportunity to
explain why farts are funny and queefs are not.

282
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,360
Men have always joked about farts
and we,in fact,name our farts.

283
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,920
We have the
squeaker --

284

there's the --

287
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,140
excuse me!If that really is your
argument, it isn't a very sound one.

288
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,350
Women name their queefs,too.

289
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,080
- That's right!
- Of course we do!

290
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,850
For instance,we have
the sneezing unicorn.

291
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,180
And the resuscitator.

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,230

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,260
We've got the chinese firecracker.

Aw,come on.Just 'cuz you
can't queef anymore --

339
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,940
you really think women care
that much about queefing?

340
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,790
Is that really what you
think this has all been about?

341
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,420
This has been about women having a little
bit of fun for once at your expense.

342
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,990
For just this one time,we could be the
immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable.

343
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,130
But,no.

344
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,950
You just couldn't let us have
that one little thing,could you?

345
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,430
Because even though things
are getting better for women,

346
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,190
You still think of us as
lesser people sometimes

347
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,660
and we always have to prove
ourselves twice as hard.

348
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,680
Congratulations,guys,for
getting your way.

349
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,960
Again.

350
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,460
Mom,we
didn't mean --

351
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,000
boy,oh,boy.I think we might
have screwed up royal,stan.

352
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,550
Yeah.We all got so
caught up in how we felt

353
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,310
that we didn't realize women actually
cared about something a lot deeper.

354
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,230
Stan,let's call the guys together.

355
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,820
Maybe we can make this right.

356
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,490
There's a time in our lives

357
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,580
when we must listen to the oppressed.

358
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,760
And realmige we've
been keeping women down.

359
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,760
They have power and they have courage.

360
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,690
And we must all
stand by the belief --

361
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,010
That a woman is strong and
she has the right to queef.

362
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,370
Fly free.

363
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,960
Free to queef aloud. Fly free.

364
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,160
Let every queer show that you're proud.

365
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,570
You faced so many challenges
to put an end to your grief.

366
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,250
You're a woman now and
you are free to queef.

367
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,960
It's time for equality.

368
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,150
We must give them the
respect they deserve.

369
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,970
They're just the same as you and me.

370
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,020
Their rights must be preserved.

371
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,210
Queef free!

372
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,300
Every woman has the right.

373
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,060
Queef free.

374
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,960
Let your queefing star shine bright.

375
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,860
You are woman,hear you roar.

376
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,680
Queefing too loud to ignore.

377
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:59,000
Queef a little each day and
let your soul take e pight.

378
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:05,050
Aaahh,ahhh,queef free!

379
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,540
For this reason,a man will
leave his father and mother,

380
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,790
And be united to his wife and
the two will become one flesh.

381
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,740
No!

382
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,000
Stop it,katherine! This
is a serious moment.

383
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,160
Therefore what god has joined
that wether let no man --

384
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,690
Oh,sick!

385
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,550
That's it! I now pronounce
you farts and queefs!

386
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,070
