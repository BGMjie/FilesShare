00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,820
You guys! You guys!
We can finally do it!

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,590
We can finally leave this crappy town
and live the life we've al dreamed of!

6
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,730
We can?

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,070
What are you talking about,dude?

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,140
Haven't you assholes
been watching the news?

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,100
Pirating is back,my friends.

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,410
Swashbuckling adventure
on the high seas.

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,200
The stuff we've all dreamed about!

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,530
And it's all happening right here!

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,880
Somalia!

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,290
Somalia? Where's that?

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,830
North africa.

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,100
Just picture it,guys!

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,150
Clear blue water with skull islands!

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,640
Waterfalls with jewelled
treasure underneath!

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,040
I've worked it all out on expedia,and
we can take southwest airlines to miami.

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,870
Then dubai air here to cairo.

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,230
Then it's just a 49-hour
bus ride into mogadishu

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,060
with all the booty and
plunder a pirate could want.

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,180
You know,cartman,this
is an awesome idea.

24
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,900
You should totally go to somalia.

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,650
Right! Wait a minute.

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,740
You never think my ideas are good,kyle.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,590
No,i'm being totally serious.

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,650
That is the best idea you've ever had.

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,260
You should run away to mogadishu.

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,720
You should go there right away!

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,300
I'll even help plan your trip!

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,370
Wow,cool! What a minute. The?

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,060
Why would you do that?

34
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,780
Unless you're trying
to trick me somehow.

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,790
No,no! You're right.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,500
Somalia is an oasis of
treasure and waterfalls!

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,210
It's totally the pirate's life!

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,650
Then why don't you want to go?

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,500
Well,'cuz,dude,i'm
jewish.And,you know --

40
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,220
jews can't be pirates.

41
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,760
That's true.

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,800
Well,i'm glad you've come to
terms with your disability,kyle.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,660
Gentlemen,i'm off the start planning.

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,050
Well,there's really not that many of

75
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,400
But,guys,g-i-n-g-e-r-s can't be
spirits because they don't have souls.

76
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,730
Please get it out of here.

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,540
Fine! I don't want to
be a pirate anyways!

78
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,450
Okay,anyways.

79
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,880

I can't believe i'm actually doing it.

103
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,050
Yeah,maybe we should think about this.

104

You guys,the?

All the homework? The rules?

107
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,210
Butters,do you really want to just go back
to school where people just make fun of you?

108
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,280
- Who? You mean you?
- Yes!

109
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,520
- Do you really want to go back to that?
- No! I'm sick of it!

Well,all right then,fag!
We can't turn back now.

350
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,290
And our parents hollered at us.

351
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,120
Yeah!

352
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,410
So we wanted to come
here and be pirates.

353
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,400
Pirates!

354
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,330
But that's what i do not understand.

355
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,750
Why would anyone want to be a pirate?

356
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,340
Every day,i dream that i can go
to school,learn about the world.

357
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,330
But my mother,she's dying of aids,and
there is no money for medicine.

358
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,340
My father was killed
trying to find food for us.

359
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,560
Do you know how i feel every
time we try to capture a boat?

360
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,800
Scared.

361
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,780
And not just scared,because
i might get killed,

362
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,110
But scared because if i
don't get something out of it,

363
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,110
my family and friends are going to die.

364
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,150
I don't want to be a pirate.

365
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,820
I have don't see how anybody would.

366
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,670
Oh,my god.

367
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,940
Jeez,guess we kinda got
put in our place,huh,ike?

368
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,830
I feel like an asshole.

369
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah,me,too.

370
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,610
Go on! Walk the plank,ye scurvy dog!

371
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,940
Cartman,knock it off!

372
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,430

373
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,710
*********

374
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,200
******

375
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,310
eric! Hey,eric! Listen,we wanna go home.

376
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,160
What?

377
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,670
Me and ike,we been talking and,well,guys,we
really had it pretty good back in america.

378
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,210
I mean,sure,it's easy to think our
lives are boring and full of rules,

379
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,650
But a lot of people have it way worse.

380
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,580
The pirates' life isn't a
life of fun and adventure.

381
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,690
It's a life of hardship and suffering.

382
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,240
When you get down to it,we were
pretty lucky to have the lives we did.

383
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,590
Clyde?

384
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,600
I hate it here. It wanna go home!

385
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,840
You guys cannot leave
the pirate club now!

386
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,930
How can you not want to stay
in this paradise we've created?

387
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,970
In somalia people have no laws!

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,190
They have no rules and
they never grow old!

389
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,130
They never grow old because
they die before they're 30!

390
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,200
Nobody's going anywhere!

391
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,580
I'm the captain of this outfit.

392
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,220
To arms!

393
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,710
Now is there any
question who's in charge?

394
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,380
I have an entire pirate crew
willing to do anything for me

395
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,360
*******

396
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:14,990
all right,men. Remember,do
not hit the white ones!

397
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,490
Me and my crew are gonna
go on pirating forever!

398
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,290
Clear.

399
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,840
The?
