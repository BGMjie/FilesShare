00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,580

here,heresee?see

54
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,470
i got my mouth on the barrel.

55
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,410
look at you now.

56
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,090
we're all dead!

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,580
IN LOVING MEMORY Gordon Stoltski

58
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,650
we will always remember the way that gordon bravely read the announcements every morning.

59
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,320
lead us in the pledge of allegiance,mkay,

60
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,920
and touched many kids' lives here at the school.

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,900
and even though we now know that the shooter had him confused

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,810
with a 40yearold truck driver who happened to have a similar name,

63
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,760
i know this has been pretty traumatizing,mkay.

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,500
but now we must decide who will pick up where little gordon left off?

65
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,530
who will take his place reading the morning announcements?

66
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,230
it is a big responsibility.

67
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,040
because it will be your voice the entire school listens to,mkay.

68
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,200
and although gordon stoltski can never be replaced,mkay,

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,900
there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,260
have his or her voice heard every morning.

71
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,860
oh my gaaawd.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,550
morning announcement tryouts

73
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,080
so you're,uh,trying out to be the morning announcements person as well?

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,510
yeah.i think it would be really ffun and raise my self esesesesteem.

75
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,120
oh this is it,huh?

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,880
okay,uh,mike,why don't we have you tryout first.

77
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,660
he stutters like a bitch!

78
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,930
i've got this job in the bag!

79
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,260
who are you?

80
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,100
my name is casey miller

81
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,630
and i'm in the third grade.

82
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,900
ever since i can rember,

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,770
people have told me i should read the morning announcements.

84
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,350
my friends always said to me,'

85
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,480
dear casey,your voice is like butter to our ears.

86
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,140
could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves?

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,340
well,here i am.

88
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,810
and hopefully i'll be the kid with the job.

89
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,530
mkay,really nice mike.

90
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,250
maybe next time you can get past the first word.

91
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,430
oh,casey miller,good.

92
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,730
you're trying out,too?

93
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,390
i'm trying out and drying out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.

94
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,170
mkay,eric.you wanna go next?

95
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,240
mkay,eric.i'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.

96
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,990
mr.mackey,

97
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,240

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,650
what?what on earth are you askin' me that for?

99
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,830
wul,it's just that.

100
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,210
that's what that casey kid said about your hair piece.

101
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,150
get lost you little dirt ball!

102
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,540
- excuse me?
- i said take a hike!

103
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,970
i don't understand what i did wrong.

104
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:49,600
beat it.you're not getting the job!

105
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,410
Good morning, south park elementary

106
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,000
these are the morning announcment

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,290
and i am eric cartman.

108
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,610
all forms for the school book drive must be handed in to mr.davis in the library

109
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,960
by the end of the school day today.

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,390
doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that.

111
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,870
oh,well.

112
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,370
for lunch today,the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches.

113
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,390
cold sandwiches.

114
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,060
oh,well.thank you so much.

115
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,840
remember when we used to be served hot food?

116
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,850
i mean,what has happened to our school?

117
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,070
this school is transforming into something very bad and why?

118
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,240
because we have leadership that doesn't care.

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,670
i'm talking of course about our student body president.

120
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,370
wendy testaburger.

121
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,190
ever since wendy was elected student body president,

122
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,840
this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime

123
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,290
where students no longer have a voice.

124
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,070
the music room will be closed off today due to painting.

125
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,120
all students in band or choir will meet in the gymnasium instead.

126
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,100
oh so,now the school is using money to paint the music room.

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,370
how old and outdated is our playground equipment?

128
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,150
what other school has a 15yearold merry go round on it?

129
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,060
our school president is turning this whole place into communist russia.

130
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,570
it's not a coincidence,that once wendy took office this school

131
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,380
started coming apart at the seams.you teachers don't want to tell you,

132
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,000
but they are scared and they should be

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,540
because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.

134
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,870
oh jeez!

135
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,340
but hey,i'm just a normal kid,like you except that i ask questions.

136
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,170
and because i'm brave enough to ask questions,i come under scrutinies.

137
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,680
is wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin?

138
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,480
probably not.but how can we know?

139
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,450
i don't want my lunch money going to drugs.

140
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,540
who's taking these drugs?

141
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,270
what would be the point?i'm asking questions.

142
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,840
will somebody shut him up?

143
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,840
you wanted to see me,principal victoria?

144
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,350
the job is to read what is written on the paper,

145
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,430
eric,not to embellish the way you do.

146
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,890
i get it.

147
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,570
you're trying to silence me!

148
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,410
you're scared that somebody is standing up to this school

149
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,900
and its president for once!

150
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,320
no,it's just that the announcements need to be quick

151
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,420
so the students can get on with their work!

152
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,600
oh,really?then how come gordon stolski got to go on

153
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,390
for like five minutes that one day?

154
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,960
well,because he was being murdered.

155
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,710
you just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain washed zombie,

156
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,860
is that it,mr.mackey?

157
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,870
i am not gordon stolski,okay?

158
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,060
i'm not some dog a leash that just blindly says what he's told,until he's killed.

159
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,440
all we ask is you keep it shorter.

160
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
oh,i will.

161
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,420
and maybe i'll also have a word with the aclu.

162
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,840
tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against is school.

163
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,690
i'm sure they'll find that very interesting.

164
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,060
well.

165
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,540
gooood morning,south park elementary.

166
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,140
these are the morning announcements.

167
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,130
tryouts for the soccer team are friday afternoon.that is,of course,

168
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,540
if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.

169
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
i have a question.

170
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,540
what does wendy testaburger actually do?

171
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,180
she is supposed to be our president,right?

172
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,250
what is her agenda?she's lying to everyone!

173
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,790
or is she?let's ask these questions!

174
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,370
today i want to talk briefly about the state of our school's economy.

175
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,820
the bake sale last week was a complete failure.

176
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,670
and besides that,who voted for wendy testaburger?i know i didn't.

177
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,160
and everyone who did is now scratching their heads and going oops!
guess i shouldn't have done that

178
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,390
.i'm not in student council.

179
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,300
i'm just a normal kid like all of you.

180
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,250
and like all of you,i want to know what has happened to my school!

181
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,300
i pledge allegiance to the flag.

182
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,120
of the united states of america.

183
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,380
our united states not the one that wendy testaburger would have,

184
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,280
a socialist dung hole.

185
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,010
a socialist dung hole.

186
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,310
good morning,students.these are the morning announcements.

187
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,650
if you will direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class.

188
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,260
you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.

189
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,570
oh god.no!

190
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,720
lunch today is going to be pizza.

191
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,280
again.

192
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,890
friends,our school is dying and you know it.

193
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,970
you feel it.

194
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,070
you're like me you wanna change it.

195
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,070
but oh no,wendy testaburger's not gonna let that happen.

196
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,490
this is not the school we grew up in and.

197
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,860
and i don't know if we can get it back.

198
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,630
so let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants.

199
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,470
you know,what is she trying to achieve?

200
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,290
let's just take a look at these key words.

201
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,760
wendy has made it clear that she wants our school to be a more integrated,

202
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,520
leftist,and liberal place.

203
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,290
but you see when that happens what we get

204
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,300
is a socialist modern utopian reformed farce of a school.

205
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,740
so when you look closely it becomes very obvious what wendy wants.

206
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,190
kill smurfs.

207
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,210
our school president wants to kill smurfes.

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,970
nooo!

209
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,890
i don't know if we're turning into a smurf hating school or what we're turning into.

210
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,790
but unless you ask why,

211
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,220
we're gonna transform into something.

212
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,090
hey wendy!wendy!

213
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,650
is it true?

214
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,850
is what true?

215
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,490
that you hate smurfs!

216
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,750
i don't have time for this.

217
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,920
hey now,me and us fellers are just asking questions!

218
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,220
- that's right!
- we can ask!

219
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,570
try to understand this

220
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,710
all i do is try to help run student council.

221
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,500
i don't give a crap about smurfs!

222
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,790
it is true!

223
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,160
- oh my god!
- she admitted it!

224
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,080
maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does

225
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,990
before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you!

226
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,240
what did the smurfs ever do to you?

227
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,950
ya bitch!

228
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,600
i just called the president a bitch!

229
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,550
- yeah!
- that was cool!

230
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,940
awesome

231
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,510
- thank you,and this is to.
- douglas.

232
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,780
to douglas,there you go.

233
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,810
book signing today,everyone.

234
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,130
be sure to pick up your copy.

235
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,940
- hey eric!
- well,hello.

236
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,220
another person who cares about the future of our school!

237
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,260
oh,you bet!i love all the stuff you said

238
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,440
about how our school president never does anything!

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,290
and how she's changing everything!

240
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,170
yes.well,now you can read about all the things i've said,butters.

241
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,540
take this copy of my book.

242
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,850
cool,thanks!

243
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,220
that'll be $5.

244
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,150
oh okay.

245
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,670
- what the hell do you think you're doing?
- a book signing.

246
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,930
i looked through your stupid book!

247
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,070
it's 540 pages of ripping on wendy and calling her a slut!

248
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,780
i do not directly say she's a slut.

249
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,800
wendy testaburger has proven time and time again

250
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,180
that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina.

251
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,880
whether it is the school football team or the janitor's on their break,

252
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,870
wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back

253
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,110
taking the ol' in out for hours on end.

254
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,530
you didn't read the rest,dude.

255
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,450
- or does she.
- or does she?

256
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,550
see,that's a question.

257
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,360
i'm asking questions,stan!

258
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,460
i've called for wendy to come on my show and defend herself,but she won't do it.

259
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,070
yeah,and she hates smurfs!

260
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,620
"shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl

261
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,970
who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?

262
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,130
stop reading that!

263
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,310
what do you mean?

264
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,490
listen,just because a guy's voice is on the intercom

265
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,900
and his words are in a book doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!

266
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,370
yes,it does.

267
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,000
eric cartman is simply making it

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,080
so that all kids take the responsibility to question their school leaders.

269
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,950
we should all ask if our president is a penis hungry hooker with a huge vagina.

270
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,050
i'm casey miller.

271
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,310
wendy,did you see the stuff cartman is saying about you now?

272
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,590
i really don't care,stan.

273
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,350
well,don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?

274
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,920
everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.

275
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,930
i'm not giving eric fartman one minute of my time you got that?

276
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,760
i'm not acknowledging his stupid questions.

277
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,070
if you want him dealt with you'll have to do it yourself.

278
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,240
you wanted to see me again,principal victoria?

279
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,380
eric,we've been informed by a concerned student

280
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,540
that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.

281
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,150
oh,wendy came and told on me?

282
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,430
so what,because she's president she can't be written about?

283
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,950
eric,apparently you wrote that

284
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,780
wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through,mkay.

285
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,800
and what if they are?

286
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,150
you'll stop me from asking just because wendy forces you to?

287
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,090
eric the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you

288
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,690
just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book.

289
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,340
face it,you're a lackey,mackey.

290
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,690
eric,i've had enough!

291
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,470
you cannot and you will not sel your books on school grounds.

292
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,150
do i make myself clear?

293
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,390
clear as summer rain.

294
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,690
clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water!

295
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,300
this school has finally transformed into the socialist whore land

296
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,110
where a student isn't free.

297
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,390
well,i'm not going to be a part of it.do you understand?

298
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,410
i am leaving this hypocritical communist school!

299
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,080
i am walking out and i am never coming back!

300
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,330
live from the principal's office

301
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,180
these are the morning announcements.

302
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,210
here is eric cartman.

303
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,340
yesterday,as most of you know,

304
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,920
i walked out on this program and on our school.

305
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,520
i was so.fed up with our president's hypocrisies,

306
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,670
me not being allowed to sell my book.

307
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,710
i wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld.

308
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,720
and so i decided to leave it all behind and instead go and live with the smurfs.

309
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,820
i simply observed the gentle smurfs at first.

310
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,270
i wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives.

311
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,920
they were wary of me at the beginning,

312
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,640
but slowly,i began to earn their trust.

313
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,330
it wasn't long before the gentle smurfs accepted me as one of their own.

314
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,010
the smurfs and i grew to understand each other.

315
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,590
they shared with me their art of picking smurfberries.

316
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,980
and i shared with them stories of my country's forefathers.

317
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,340
of course,it wasn't long before.

318
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,070
i fell in love with smurfette.

319
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,250
we were from two different worlds and yet,

320
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,350
we spoke the common language of passion.

321
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,990
these are the morning announcements?

322
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,360
poppa smurf was displeased at first.

323
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,460
he told smurfette i wasn't a real smurf and we could never be happy.

324
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,280
but i proved myself to poppa smurf

325
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,570
by picking more smurf berries than any smurf had ever smurfed before.

326
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,810
finally,all was right with the world.

327
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,640
but then.a cris.

328
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,370
clumsy smurf burst into the smurf ceremony to say

329
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,410
that humans had come to destroy all of smurfland.

330
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,120
no!no you must leave the noble smurfs alone!

331
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,020
who is behind all this?

332
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,850
i should have known!

333
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,010
wendy!

334
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,400
out of my way!

335
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,730
wendy!what are you doing here?

336
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,400
smurf berries are worth a lot of money.

337
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,950
with all those smurf berries i can power the school for the entire year!

338
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,780
wendy,i know you're the president of our school.

339
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,680
but you can't just dig up the smurfs land!

340
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,690
the smurfs!

341
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,270
they can suck my fat tits.

342
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,930
how many smurf berries is enough,wendy?

343
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,810
you can suck my fat tits too.

344
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,260
smurfette noooo!

345
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,070
suck my fat tits!

346
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,990
and so now our school has plenty of precious,unobtainable smurf berries.

347
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,610
yeah.well,big deal.

348
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,190
at what cost did our school president get it?

349
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,000
every smurf is dead.

350
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,150
wiped out and we will never see them again.

351
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,280
go on,look outside.

352
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,250
you won't see any smurfs.

353
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,840
of course,since i'm being silenced i'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie.

354
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,020
and so please buy "dances with smurfs" available now on dvd.

355
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,200
the question now is what happened to morals?

356
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,660
what happened to dignity?

357
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,880
what happened to my schoo?

358
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,470
that does it!

359
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,980
our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!

360
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,510
i can no longer stand idly by.

361
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,820
we need to get all the kids together who want to fight back

362
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,640
and tell them to meet after school!

363
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,410
we will forever remember this day,

364
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,390
the day we finally stood up to wendy testaburger!

365
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:16,630
it is time for that slutty smurf killing bitch to get what's coming to her.

366
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,770
i don't know about all of you,

367
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,680
but i have had enough!

368
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,240
we've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet!

369
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,330
but today,we do something about it!

370
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,560
so let's march right on over to wendy's house,

371
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,650
and do what we know needs to be done!

372
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,510
alright!

373
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,180
let us not forget what happens this day!

374
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,330
do it!

375
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,110
we are here,wendy!

376
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,130
*******************that school president!

377
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,260
get her good!

378
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,130
i am.

379
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,150
hey!what are you doing?

380
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,470
the students want answers!

381
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,200
go on the morning announcements if you've got nothing to hide!

382
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,250
what the hell?

383
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,490
smurf killer!

384
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,520
answer for your crimes on the morning announcements!

385
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,470
wendy?did a boy just pee on our door because the smurfs were murdered?

386
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,480
it's okay dad.

387
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,510
i'll take care of it.

388
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,220
thank you so much for finally coming on my show,wendy.

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,870
yeah.well,butters peed on my house.

390
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,240
people are riled up.

391
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,160
hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.

392
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,540
if we could just keep it to questions about student council.

393
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,670
of course.that's why we're here.

394
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,040
five seconds.

395
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,470
don't worry.i won't go too hard on ya.

396
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,920
good morning south park elementary.

397
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,690
these are the morning announcements.

398
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,740
rehearsals for the school play are canceled this afternoon.

399
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,940
for the lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta.

400
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,700
my guest today is the student body president of south park elementary,wendy testaburger.

401
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,220
- wendy thank you for coming on the show.
- sure.

402
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,460
wendy,i want to start by asking a pretty straight forward question

403
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,900
- and i hope you won't take offense to it.
- okay.

404
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,580
how many smurfberries is the life of each smurf worth?

405
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,370
i don't.i

406
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,460
i have no idea what.

407
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,010
you don't know how many smurfberries the life of each smurf is worth?

408
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,040
ooh he's got her now!

409
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,220
would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?

410
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,450
i believe there's a few things wrong with the school,but

411
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,930
if a smurf dies and no one is around to hear it,does it still scream?

412
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,470
- she's speechless!
- you are the president of the school

413
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,860
can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut?

414
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,610
are you denying that the smurf holocaust ever happened?

415
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,190
is that what you are suggesting?

416
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,500
look,eric!you have to understand,

417
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,010
the smurfberries were our school government's only option!

418
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,740
yes,and that makes woa,wait.what?

419
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,090
what was i suppose to do?

420
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,980
the school was running out of power!

421
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,760
we tried relocating the smurfs at first,but they wouldn't budge.

422
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,810
so we decided to get somebody on the inside.

423
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,460
a member of the school who could act like one of the smurfs and learn their secrets.

424
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,290
but of course,you know that don't you?

425
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,790
what do you mean i know that?

426
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,420
i'm just asking the question.

427
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,350
we all knew you were sent in to live with the smurfs,

428
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,800
but did you know they would be wiped out?

429
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,390
no.you wiped them all out!

430
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,980
nobody expected you to fall in love with smurfette!

431
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,490
you went to learn from them but instead you became one of them.right?

432
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,840
fought against your own kind!

433
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,070
when you knew we'd stop at nothing.

434
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,700
do you know that one smurfberry can power the school for two months?

435
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,030
one smurfberry!

436
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,320
wait.hold on.can we take a break?

437
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,330
no,it's okay.

438
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,780
it's all out in the open now.

439
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,970
i wouldn't have had to kill the smurfs if they would have simply moved on,

440
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,980
but you gave them the will to stay.

441
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,900
and i guess you can't be blamed for that.

442
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,500
what?

443
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,800
and that is why.

444
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,170
i am stepping down.

445
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,800
you were right all along,cartman.

446
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,810
and i am hereby making you the student body president.

447
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,500
alright!cartman's president!

448
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,950
we did it!

449
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,450
i'm confused.

450
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,730
dude,you can't take my dances with smurfs idea,and turn it into your own

451
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,900
no,you're right.

452
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,810
the students all deserve to know the truth.

453
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,410
and so i have answered what really happened in my new book going rogue on the smurfs.

454
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,740
no,no,dude.

455
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,670
you don't just take one person's story and then add a couple things and call it yours!

456
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,030
luckily,with the money i made selling the movie rights to my book,i'll be okay.

457
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,810
you sold the movie rights to who?

458
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,920
james cameron.go look,the movie came out already!

459
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,480
they can't do that!

460
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,770
i'm student body president!

461
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,200
oh, god damn it!

462
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,830
son of bitch,idea stealing assholes!

463
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,290
you sons of bitches

464
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,530
Dances With Smurfs was my idea!

465
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,510
My idea! you...

466
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,820
You can't just take Dances With Smurfs
and call it something else!

467
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,150
Dude, what happened?
You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?

468
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,380
No, because it turns out that by rule...

469
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,480
the student body president
can't also be the morning announcement reader

470
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,070
Oh well, At least as President,
you can run the school the way you want

471
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,410
I can't do jack!

472
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:03,480
I went to my first student council meeting!
All we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance!

473
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,940
Student council is retarded!

474
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,820
The sun is up and the birds are chirping

475
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm Casey Miller and these are the morning announcements

476
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,930
I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Felner

477
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,110
Brian writes,"Dear Casey,

478
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,330
why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead?

479
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,490
My desk is broken, and so far
Eric Cartman has done nothing about it.

480
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:29,010
Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus
know that we are not happy."

481
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,200
Well, Brian, I couldn't agree more.

482
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,490
Our asshole president is
a fat, smelly, douchebag milkshake

483
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,370
I'm doing the best I can!
