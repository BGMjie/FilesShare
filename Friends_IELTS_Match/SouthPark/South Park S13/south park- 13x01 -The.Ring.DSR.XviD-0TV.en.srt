00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,220

5
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,580
it's just incredible,isn't it?

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,100
i still can't believe it.

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,910
even though it's right
there in front of me.

8
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,850
yeah,it's just so astounding.

9
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,460

yeah. a fifth grader girlfriend.

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,980
this is serious. they've been
going out for almost two weeks now.

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,450
so who is she?

14
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,540
her name's tamny warner.

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,380
she's the only girl in school whose
family is actually poorer than kenny's.

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,140
it's really kind of
beautiful, if you ask me.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,870
you guys! you guy,i think
we have a big problem!

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,650

i just talked to brad dixon.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,560
tammy warner is bad news.

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,430
al the fifth graders call her a slut

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,710
on a count she gave this kid dave darski
a b.j.in the parking lot of tgi fridays.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,390

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,290

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300

32
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,560

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,660
she even gave a kid named dave darski
a b.j.in the parking lot of tgi fridays.

46
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,900
your girlfriend's a slut, dude.

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,550
he took it pretty well.

48
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,840
- hey,tammy!
- hi,ken!

49
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,560
you decide what you
wanna do after school?

50
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,990
yeah,i was kind of thinking
we should go to tgi fridays.

51
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,550
tgi fridays?

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,860
yeah,could be lots of fun.

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,250
yeah,okay. but
-- kenny,listen.

54
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,400
there's something i need
to talk to you about.

55
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,800
there's a lot of rumors going around
about me,that i agreed to give a boy a b.j.

56
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,170
well,it's true.

57
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,130
but it was before you
and i were together.

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,740
and it wasn't my fault!

59
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,190
see,i was watching the disney channel.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,720
and that show came on
with the jonas brothers.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,940
jonas brothers?

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,900
you know,that teenage boy band?

63
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,710
every time i see them i get so tingly.

64
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,620
i just completely lose control.

65
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,900
and then dave darski showed
up and took me to tgi fridays.

66
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,900
and it just happened.

67
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,110
but it was only for one second
and i had my eyes closed.

68
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,350
i know it's terrible.

69
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,990
can you,can you forgive me, ken?

70
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,920
there you are,young man.

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,490

jonas brothers concert.

72
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,400
thanks!

73
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,060
the jonas brothers?

74
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,570
dude,kenny,what the
hell is wrong with you?

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,440
aren't they those queermos
on the disney channel?

76
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,400
yeah,jonas brothers,dude. they get tammy
all hot and then she'll give me a b.j.

77
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,640
a b.j.? you want tamny
to give you a b.j.?

78
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,100
of course,dude!

79
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,540
kenny! you're gonna let a girl
put her mouth on your wiener?

80
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,410
do you know how disgusting that is?

81
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,190
girls' mouths are full of germs.

82
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,510
yeah,dude,that's gross.

83
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,120
it's okay. i'm gonna have protection.

84
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,240
what kind of protection?

85
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,500
can i have a box of condoms, please?

86
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,590
box of condoms? certainly,little boy.

87
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,070
which kind would you like?

88
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,980
uhhh,i'll take those over there.

89
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,180
these here? well,certainly.

90
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,500
cool.

91
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,490
kenny,aren't you a
little young for this?

92
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,310
no,i'm not young. i want a b.j.!

93
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,880
just because you have condoms
doesn't mean you're safe,kenny.

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,080
statistically speaking,the most
bacteria ridden place on the planet

95
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,690
is the mouth of an american woman.

96
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,300
and you're going to let
that near your penis?

97
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,280
yup! woo-hoo!

98
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,190
kenny,you're the best
for bringing me here!

99
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,320
isn't this awesome?

100
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,660
my giney tickles!

101
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,680

113
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,180

121
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,970
why do you think they
called us back here?

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,420
they must wanna have sex with us.

123
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,090
what? you think so?

124
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,540
sure. they're a band.

125
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,520
they called us back here so
we can give 'em blow jobs.

126
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,710
well,i'm not doing it!

127
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,640
just 'cuz they're rock stars
doesn't mean i'll do that.

128
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,710
yeah,i'm not giving
a blow job to anybody.

129
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,000

130
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,940

133
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,990

136
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,120
look,we called you back here because we want
you to share our love of christ with you.

137
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,810

purity rings from now on.

138
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,200

139
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
we all wear purity rings.

140
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,680
it means we are going to be pure
and not have sexl in we're married.

141
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,390
and it means we stay away from bad stuff,and
avoid people who swear on watch naughty tv shows.

142
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,170
that's just how we roll.

143
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,400

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,110

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,490
okay.

147
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,080
and be sure to give a ring to
all the kids you care about.

148
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,930

it means i'm gonna be pure and
not have sex until i get married.

157
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,390

to have a b.j.before you got too old --

158
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,900
i did! i was really excited to get a
b.j.,but now i have to wear this purity ring!

159
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,470
all right,all right. kenny,calm down.

160
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,720
you're too young to be
getting b.j.s anyway.

161
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,480
it's good you and tammy are making a commitment
to each other that isn't based on sex.

162
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,860
yeah!

163
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,270
it isn't fair. i was so close to getting
a blow job and i'll never get one now.

167
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,760

168
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,430
they're rings that says they're not gonna
have sex or do anything naughty anymore.

169
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,540

together but not have sex.

170
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,700
isn't that called a wedding ring?

171
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,050
* i've got a ring on my finger
to remind what i cannot do

172
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,490
* can't just do whatever i feel like
i've got to stay righteous and true

173
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,960
* i can't hang out with my
buddies or get into trouble

174
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,310
* 'cuz now we're both wearing
these rings for each other

175
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,610
* but who needs sex
and drugs and partying

176
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:14,510
* when we can cook a meal then
sit around and watch net flix,baby

177
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,360
* i've got a ring on my finger
to remind me that  i must behave

178
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,240
* no need to chase after girls
it's a promise i can never break

179
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,430
* we made a commitment and it is forever

180
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,770
* so we can spend every
waking minute together

181
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,050
* and if we get bored
it won't be a problem

182
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,980
* 'cuz we can just hang out with
other couples who wear these rings,baby

183
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,260
yeah,we found out that
once you wear purity rings,

184
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,490
it's best to hang out
with other couples that do.

185
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,850
got more in common,isn't
that right,sarah?

186
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,210
you know what carol and i
really enjoy is "grey's anatomy."

187

we love "grey's
anatomy," don't we,carol?

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,500
oh,oh,look like we've got a problem.

199
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,850
our decision is final!

200
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,900
we have decided as a band not
to wear purity rings anymore.

201
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,270
yeah! you tell 'em,joe.

202
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,720
boys,i know you're tired, but the purity
rings are important to the company's image.

203
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,180
we don't care about the company!

204
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,730
and you're gonna say
that to the boss' face?

205
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,500
we aren't afraid of him.

206
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,600
well,i hope you're right, because
the boss is on his way here now.

207
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,540
oh,jesus. he's here. boss is here.

208
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,520
let's be strong,guys.

209
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,160
hello,sir! how was your trip?

210
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,140
what's this i'm hearing about
not wearing the purity rings?

211
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,460
uh,we'll just leave you alone.

212
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,160
so i guess we have some issues?

213
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,920
we need to talk about something.

214
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,170
oh,boy.

215
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,110
i just love flying all the way to
colorado to hear about your problems.

216
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,100
look,we just want our concerts to be
about our music and not about purity rings.

217
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,490
oh,gosh,fellas,let me explain
this to you one more time.

218
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,520
you have to wear the purity rings because
that's how we can sell sex to little girls.

219
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,740
se,if we make the posters with
little girls reaching for your junk,

220
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,890
then you have to wear purity rings
or else disney company looks bad.

221
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,890
but we don't want to be selling
sex to little girls anymore.

222
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,140
the rings stay on.

223
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,010
well,well maybe we'll
just refuse to go onstage.

224
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,840
you don't talk to me like that.

225
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,550
you little piece of

226
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,370
get the up. get the up.

227
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,810
now do we have a problem?

228
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,140
- no,sir.
- no,mr. mouse.

229
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,770
no,mr. mouse.

230
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,950
oh,that's good,'cuz i thought we
had a problem for a minute there.

231
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,430
all right. now get out there
and make me my goddamned money.

232
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,910
yup! he's in here!

233
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,800
dude,what the hell are you doing,kenny?

234
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,140
this is the day we were supposed
to throw cow turds at cars together.

235
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,110
we've had just about enough, dude!

236
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,600
you've been blowing us off
for two weeks now. what's up?

237
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,010
need to buy more dvds.

238
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,630
"grey's anatomy"?

239
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,840
kenny,what kind of douche
bag garbage are you watching?

240
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,220
c'mon,kenny. this isn't
you. we want you back,dude.

241
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,890

242
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,820

oh,"grey's anatomy," cool!
oh,wow! this was a great season!

246
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,030
you guys,i think this is serious!

247
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,890
there's something really wrong with him.

248
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,120
it's that ring.

249
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,640
somehow putting on that ring has
turned kenny into a boring turd.

250
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,870
oh,my god,look at this! mother!

251
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,140

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,380
jonas brothers talk music,
faith in god and purity rings.

253
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,990
these disney douche bags are
the ones causing all this!

254
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,440
yeah,this all happened the day
after he went to their concert.

255
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,410
all right,c'mon,guys.

256

now,guys,a lot has been
made about your purity rings.

268
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,120
can you tell us about those?

269
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,170
well,um,we wear these to
symbolize how pure we are

270
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,450
and how we don't approve of
things that are naughty or filthy.

271
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,380
yeah,that's good. get a
close-up on their purity rings.

close up on the purity rings.

that's wonderful,boys.

274
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,470
it's good that little girls can see a
concert and not have it be about sex.

275
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,860
we understand that at the concert tonight
you'll be dousing girls in the audience

276
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,350
with white foam; is that correct?

277
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,170

278
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,380

a peek? what do you think,girls?

wouerm-ridden pnfce on earter a i said.
