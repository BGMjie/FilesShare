4
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,030
Do I really have to do this,dad?

5
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,830
Stan,now more than ever you need to
understand the importance of saving money.

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,110
But grandma said I could use
this money to buy whatever I want.

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,870
Okay,next,please.

8
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,800
Go on,stanley.

9
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,920
How can I help you,young man?

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,990
I got $100 check from my grandma.

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,830
And my dad said I need to put it in
the bank so it can grow over the years.

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,280
Well,that's fantastic. A
really smart decision,young man.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,410
We can put that check in
a money market mutual fund,

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,210
Then we'll reinvest the earnings
into foreign currency accounts

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,230
with come can pounding
interest and it's gone!

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,690
Uhh,what?

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,510
It's gone. It's all gone.

18
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,660
What's all gone?

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,760
The money in your account. It
didn't do too well. It's gone.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,260
What do you mean? I have $100.

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,390
Not anymore,you don't. Poof!

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,570
Well,what can I do
to get back my --

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,390
i'm sorry,sir,but this line
is for bank members only.

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,740
I just opened an account!

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,970
Do you have any money
invested with this bank?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,170
No,you just lost it all.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,890
Then please stand aside for people
who actually have money with us.

28
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,260
Next,please.

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,560
Hello,mrs. Farnickle. How are you today?

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,680
Making a deposit,are we?

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,840
Great. We can just put that into your retirement
at and make it go to work for you and it's gone.

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,250
What?

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,550
Sorry,yeah. That's gone.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,050
Please step aside for people who actually
have money with the bank. Next,please.

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,140
Dad!

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,630
Hey,i'm trying to teach my son
about the importance of savings.

37
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,180
You already lost his money?

38
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,110
Oh,mr.marsh! Don't worry.

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,200
We can just transfer money from your account and
into a portfolio with your son's -- and it's gone!

40
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,220
This line is for people who
have money with the bank only.

41
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,590
Please step aside.

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,470
This is the 9 news special report.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,970
Recession! A nation in peril.

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,850
An economic cris has hit south park
and the nation like never before.

45
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,020
Another south park bank has closed
down,leaving thousands of people in debt.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,860
It's just crazy,you know?
Everyone's affected by it.

47
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,280
It's like all the money just vanished.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,170
It's really terrifying. We've got
no money to pay our mortgage now.

49
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,610
We could very easily lose our house.

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,720
Hi,grandma.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,840
First,the money started going and
now everyone's getting laid off work.

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,110
They took our jobs!

53
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,080
Just how far will the economy fall?

54
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,050
We asked economic reporter
dan banks for his assessment.

55
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,000
We'll have the rest of dan's
interview tonight at 10:00.

56
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,990
All right,everyone,eat up.

57
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,860
Oh,jesus christ.

58
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,350
Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?

59
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,200
You said we had to be
careful with our money.

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,360
I've got nothing for a food budget!

61
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,010
Mom,dad,how come there's
suddenly no money?

62
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,860
I'll tell you what happened,son.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,770
See,there's a bunch of idiot s out there
who weren't happy with what they had.

64
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,900
They wanted a bigger house and materialistic
things that they didn't even need.

65
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,500
People with no money who got loans to buy
frivolous things they had no business buying.

66
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,480
And these assholes just blindly
started buying any stupid thing

67
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,200
That looked appealing because
they thought money was endless.

68
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,620
It goes back to when the government had the idea
that everyone in america deserves to own a house.

69
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,980
So we have people having a hard time paying
their loans meaning less money coming in.

70
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,930
And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this
frivolous spending they were mocking the economy.

71
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,440
And they made the economy very angry.

72
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,990
We're all feeling the economy's vengeance
because of materialistic heathens

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,770
who did stupid things with their money.

74
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,510
Do you understand,son?

75
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,430
Yeah. I think I get it.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,220
And so why is our economy failing us?

77
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,200
Because the government kept
interest rates too low for too long!

78
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,480
The government took our economy for granted
and now we are all here paying the price!

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,610
How long will we sit and
watch our economy fall --

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,090
And so I say to you,do not listen
to the wall street brokers for they

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,250
are the ones who put
us in this situation!

82
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,410
Fat cats with corporate greed.

83
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,000
- They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom.
- and so where has all the money gone?

84
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,660
It must have gone somewhere.

85
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,630
The answer is obvious,my
friends. It is the jews!

86
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,390
Covetous jews,who have taken all our
money and hoarded it for themselves.

87
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,440
Hidden all the cash in some secret jew cave
that they built,probably back in the early '60s.

88
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,480
And now we hear all different people casting all
different kinds of blame from person to person.

89
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,920
But the fault lies in all of you. You!

90
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,830
Who bought that $300,000 house when
you only had $20,000 to put down. You!

91
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
Who bought that third car even though
only two people in your home drive.

92
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,140
It is time to stop pointing fingers.

93
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,300
Finger-pointing gets us nowhere. Steve!

94
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,980
We have mocked our economy and now the
economy has cast its vengeance upon us all.

95
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,370
He's right. This is the first
guy to actually make sense.

96
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,330
Yeah,it is an angry
and unforgiving economy.

97
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,930
To repent we must stop
frivolous spending.

98
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,100
Instead of paying for
cable,let us watch clouds!

99
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,850
Instead of buying clothes,bear
but sheets from thine beds!

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,680
Cut spending to only the bare
essentials -- water and bread.

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,430
And margaritas,yeah!

102
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,020
Hello,young man. Welcome to
sur la table. Can I help you?

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,600
Yeah. I wanna return this
margaritaville my stupid dad bought.

104
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,590
Oh,that's all we get anymore,returns.

105
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,830
Could you please put the
receipt here on this table?

106
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,940
Sorry,our computers are slow today.

107
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,500
We need a new ethernet cable.

108
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,560
Oh,i'm sorry,sir. I'd like to give you a
refund,but i'm afraid that's not doable.

109
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,920
- What?
- I said i'm not able,sir.

110
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,850
You see,this margaritaville was
purchased with a payment plan.

111
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,680
So?

112
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Well,an outside financing company
handles those payment plans.

113
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,800
Customers just pay for some of the machine
and the finance company pays for the rest.

114
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,950
Well,can't I just return it and
get the money my dad put in back?

115
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,300
Hmm,that's improbable,but
not impossible.

116
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,940
I'm not really sure how it works.

117
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,240
You'll have to speak with
the people at the top.

118
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,660
I can give you the finance company's
address if that's agreeable with you.

119
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,540
We have become lovers of pleasure,rather
than lovers of the economy.

120
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,820
There are those who will say
that the economy has forsaken us.

121
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,850
Nay you hath forsaken the economy!

122
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,510
And now you know the economy's wrath.

123
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,340
Oh,thoust can shop in
a sporting goods store,

124
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,330
But knowest thou that the economy will
take away thy broncos cap from thy head.

125
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,960
You mocked the economy without fear.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,080
Thine own stockbrokers,now
lie dead by their own hand.

127
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,590
And thou knowest that thy
stockbroker did not fear the economy.

128
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,150
Well,here we are,my friends.

129
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,280
You have brought the economy's
vengeance upon yourselves.

130
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,830
What can we do,randy?

131
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,290
Yes! Tell us! What do we
do? Tell us what to do!

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,830
We must all wear sheets instead of
buying clothes that need detergent.

133
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,410
Instead of cars that take gasoline,we
can get around on lamas from drake's farm.

134
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,560
Instead of video games that take batteries
and software,our kids can play with squirrels!

135
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,920
We must let the economy know that
we are capable of respecting it.

136
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,620
No more needless spending!

137
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,420
The economy is our shepherd.

138
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,370
We shall not want!

139
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,770
Morning,ted.

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,630
Morning,al.

141
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,620
Well,this sucks.

142
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,810
Sure was better when our
parents were buying us stuff.

143
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,670
Of all the times for people to
decide to stop buying things,

144
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,460
It has to be the week the grand theft
auto 4 comes out for nintendo ds!

145
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,610
You want something
new every week,fat ass.

146
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,070
Don't you fraternize me!

147
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,550
This is all your fault,you know.

148
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,540
My fault?

149
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,130
The jews took all the
money away and they --

150
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,650
don't even start! Don't
even start,cartman!

151
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,080
Well,why are we wearing bed sheets
and playing with squirrels,kyle?

152
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,780
Not because of the
jews,butters! Who told you that?

153
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,880
Well,eric did!

154
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,700
Just tell us where the cave is,kyle.

155
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,390
Now look!

156
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,280
The reason we're in this situation
is because people are being stupid!

157
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,680
The economy isn't some vengeable
being that takes things away from us.

158
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,880
The economy is just made up by people.

159
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,180
And people have just
lost their faith in it.

160
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,690
What people really should
be doing is spending more.

161
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,770
Spending is fine!

162
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,110
We best speak with the council.

163
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,630
Tell them a young jew is speaking
heresy towards the economy.

164
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,320
can I help you?

165
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
I want to return this margaritaville.

166
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,260
Okay. Let me send you into josh.

167
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,210
Hey,welcome to big
orange finance company!

168
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
Yeah,have a seat. You want some carmex?

169
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,700
No thanks.

170
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,340
I want to return this margaritaville and the guy at sur
la table said that you are the company that financed it.

171
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,740
Ooh,yeah. No. You know what? No,yeah.

172
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,430
What?

173
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,740
Yeah,we can't give you your
money back for that. Yeah,no.

174
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,290
You'd have to talk to the
people on wall street. Yeah.

175
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Wall street?

176
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,670
Yeah,no,see what I do is find americans who want
a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one.

177
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,690
And I hook them up with investors who want to get
into the margaritaville payment plan business,yeah.

178
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,510
So?

179
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,900
Yeah,so the problem is your margaritaville
payment plan has been combined

180
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,240
With thousands of others into
one big margaritaville security.

181
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,950
Yeah,no. Yeah. No,yeah.

182
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,950
The entire town has given
over to your ways,mr. Chairman.

183
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,430
Everyone has even stopped using electricity
so as to stop paying electrical bills.

184
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,960
You've really done an
amazing thing,mr. Marsh.

185
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,510
People have learned to hold on to their money so as
to not feel the sting of the economy's mighty sword.

186
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,770
I am pretty smart,yeah.

187
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,990
But I have assembled this economic committee
to make sure everyone sticks to my new plan.

188
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,670
We've got guards posted at the malls to make
sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff.

189
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,890
And pat saltzman is doing house checks to make
sure nobody's ordering anything stupid online.

190
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,670
Then perhaps soon our
economy will return to us.

191
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,910
Council,i bring news of discord!

192
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,390
A young jew was in the town square
speaking blasphemy about the economy.

193
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,500
What?

194
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,970
He was saying that your ideas are
false and the economy is not vengeful!

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,360
He was rallying people to spend more!

196
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,260
Spend more? What mockery is this?

197
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,480
Relax,father maxi.

198
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,630
What harm can one jew do against
our economic recovery movement?

199
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,550
I had a dream last night.

200
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,110
I was in a field,and I had grand theft
auto chinatown wars right next to me.

201
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,200
But then the sky went black and grand theft
auto chinatown wars just melted in my hands.

202
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,450
What's that?

203
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,220
Excuse me. We need to
borrow your squirrels!

204
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,140
- What?
- No! No,please!

205
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,440
You have sinned!

206
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,580
Oh,jesus,i'm sorry. Please!

207
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,460
What's going on?

208
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,800
Garrison,you have brought your
filth to this town for the last time!

209
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,840
What did he do?

210
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,980
Your teacher was caught buying a kitchen
aid stand mixer at bed,bath and beyond.

211
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,940
Take thy punishment,heathen!

212
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,440
Hey,stop it! Stop!

213
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,010
Move aside,kid. He must
pay for his stand mixer.

214
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,910
C'mon,this is ridiculous!

215
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,530
What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels
at a man who has angered the economy?

216
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,220
Just have a little compassion,huh?

217
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,350
I mean,everyone's gone out and bought
something stupid. It's not so bad.

218
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,830
Whichever of you guys has never
bought anything frivolous,go ahead

219
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,820
And huck the next squirrel

220
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,960
excuse me? Excuse me!

221
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,760
I'd like to return this har mark,please.

222
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,020
Margaritaville?

223
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,580
My dad bought it on a payment plan
that was set up by a finance company

224
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,020
Which got their principal
investors from somebody here.

225
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,620
Oh,that makes sense.

226
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,880
It does?

227
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,600
You see,son,we lumped thousands of these
margaritaville installment plans together

228
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,740
into margaritaville based securities,

229
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,270
Then chopped those securities up in a
way that we could sell them to banks.

230
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,830
So I can return it to the bank?

231
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,640
Nope. Because a bunch of people like you
are defaulting on their margaritavilles

232
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,790
So the government had to buy the
margaritaville assets from the banks.

233
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,620
What?

234
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,560
Just talk to the treasury
department. In d.c.

235
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,470
They're the ones who really
understand how all this works.

236
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,070
Oh,sell,sell,sell,sell!

237
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,140
Listen,this is all you need to know.

238
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,310
The economy is not a
supernatural all-knowing entity.

239
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,530
The economy is just an idea made
up by people thousands of years ago.

240
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,310
The economy is not
real and yet it is real.

241
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,510
Nowadays,they'll give credit cards to
practically anyone who applies for them.

242
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,670
I applied for this
yesterday to prove a point.

243
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,190
It is an american express platinum card.

244
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,400
It has no spending limb.

245
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,660
Do not be afraid!

246
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,440
This is only plastic.

247
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,480
It's just something made up by people.

248
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,380
Truly meaningless until
we put our faith in it.

249
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,370
Faith is what makes
an economy economist.

250
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,730
Without faith,it is only
plastic cards and paper money.

251
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,290
By all report,the young
jew is not letting up.

252
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,950
He is still going around convincing people
to have faith in the economy by shopping.

253
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,410
We've done everything we can and
yet the economy has not improved.

254
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,220
Worse,it has declined.

255
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,080
Poor bart here just lost his
job at little caesar's pizza.

256
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,160
Our tireless work is obviously
being undermined by this one jew.

257
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,840
Why does he go around pretending to
know the true will of the economy?

258
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,700
Perhaps he is the economy's
only son,sent to save us.

259
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,480
Are you retarded,stotch!

260
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,400
The economy is omnipotent.

261
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,580
Which means it can do anything.

262
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,820
So saying it would be
limiting to one son is stupid!

263
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,560
That is stupid,yeah.

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,090
And going around telling
people to shop is dangerous.

265
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,940
Well,then there's only one option.

266
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,880
We have to kill the jew.

267
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,750
Yep,i think we gotta kill the jew.

268
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,410
I don't know. He's got a lot of support.

269
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,160
It might be hard to even catch this jew.

270
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,440
Did somebody say "catch a jew"?

271
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,930
The person you are after might be
hard to get,but I can bring him to you.

272
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,400
And all I want in return

273
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,410
is chinatown wars for
a handheld nintendo sd

274
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,470
uh,how can we help you,young man?

275
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,250
I want to return this margaritaville.

276
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,860
My dad bought it on a payment
plan set up by a finance company

277
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,960
That got investors from wall street

278
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,440
who combined it into securities,sold
to banks who transferred it to you.

279
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,150
Ohhh,that makes sense.

280
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,140
No problem. We just need
to consult the chart.

281
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,010
We can determine your property's
value and we'll be done.

282
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,660
Really? Thank you.

283
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,690
Be right back

284
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,880
excellent news,sir.

285
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,350
We've determined the investment value of
your margaritaville to be $90 trillion!

286
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,890
What?

287
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,860
Hey,what's the matter,kyle?

288
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,480
You seem bummed out.

289
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,970
I just have a feeling this might
be the last time we get to do this.

290
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,850
Don't worry,kyle. We're not
gonna let people kill you.

291
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,760
We'll keep you hidden forever!

292
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,980
I can't just hide my whole life,butters.

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,600
And besides,i have this strange feel hag
one of you is gonna totally betray me.

294
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,860
All right,whoever is thinking of
betraying kyle,that is not cool.

295
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,030
That's frickin' lame,dude.

296
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,000
Kyle's trying to get
the economy going again.

297
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,190
If somebody is thinking of stabbing
him in the back,you're being a dick.

298
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,710
Go ahead,kyle.

299
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,930
Whoever it might happen to be,i'm
not giving him the opportunity.

300
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,450
Tomorrow,i'm going to
have to do something.

301
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,660
Something i've known I would have
to do to restore people's faith.

302
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,460
Kyle,please. For sake,don't
do anything drastic.

303
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,820
There's no choice anymore,guys.

304
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,140
Don't worry about me.

305
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,880
I've been preparing for
this for a while now.

306
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,060
No,no,no. Excuse me. I don't understand.

307
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,120
How can this stupid thing
be worth $90 trillion?

308
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,880
What,you think it's worth more?

309
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,740
No! Dude,that doesn't make sense.

310
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,620
Well,you don't get $90 trillion,but
the chart says that's what it's worth.

311
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,510
Oh,oh,problem! Problem again!

312
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,510
What is it now?

313
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,120
Another insurance company
is about to go under.

314
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,860
If they do,people could lose millions.

315
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,630
Okay. No problem. We
better consult the chart.

316
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,250
Sir,another insurance
company is going under.

317
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,420
Now determining most prudent
move for insurance company!

318
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,830
Bailout!

319
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,820
Most prudent move is a bailout!

320
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,310
Bailout the insurance company!

321
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,350
It's a miracle.

322
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,590
Why would someone do this?

323
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,080
What is this? What is going on?

324
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,320
There. Look.

325
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,340
It's the jew.

326
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,090
Somehow he got a platinum
amex with no spending limit.

327
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,870
What's he doing?

328
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,540
He's paying for everyone's debts.

329
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,080
Hey,thanks,kid. This
is really nice of you.

330
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,680
But that's impossible.
Why would he do this?

331
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,180
So that people have money to spend.

332
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,030
Kyle! Kyle,you have to stop this!

333
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,270
It's okay,ma.

334
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,940
No,kyle,you'll be in debt
for the rest of your life.

335
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,010
Please,somebody,get him to stop!

336
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,410
Uh,there's about $17,000 worth here

337
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,350
he paid for our debts so
we could spend once more.

338
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,030
He's dead.

339
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,850
No,he's just passed out.
We should get him to bed.

340
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:06,320
For the first time in almost a year,the economy in
south park has take an small,but noticeable upturn.

341
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,590
Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly
debt-free people feel safe to make purchases.

342
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,530
The new margaritaville!

343
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,180
With salsa dispenser!

344
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,300
Just pour your favorite salsa in the top
and it comes out the dispenser at the bottom!

345
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,670
Oh,we need this!

346
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,110
Are we out of the woods yet?

347
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,540
Only time will tell.

348
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,200
But we must not forget the sacrifice
one person made to restore our faith

349
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,630
And make us believe in
the economy once again.

350
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,560
The person we must thank every
day for his amazing sacrifice --

351
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,580
barack obama.

352
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,120
Ah.come on.
