00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,150
Hey,jimmy,what are you up to?

5
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,010
Oh,hey,eric.

6
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,170
I was just trying to write some
new jokes for my comedy routine.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,580
Yeah,well,you wanna do something?

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,720
I wanted to hang out with stan and kyle,but
they're all pissed off at me for something,

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,080
So I have to hang out with you.

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,220
Sorry,eric,but I really
need to work,very much.

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,940
I haven't written a
good joke in over a week.

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,900
All right. Well,maybe I can help you.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,810
You know,we can totally
write some stuff together.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,870
Oh,well,sure.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,730
I've never really tried working with a
partner,but let's give it a shotsgarrooski.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,140
Let's see.

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,370
I was working on this. Why does
a squirrel swim on its back?

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,330
To keep his nuts dry.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,330
Nah,that's not that funny.
Let's try something else.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,080
A fireman and a pollack are
eating marshmallows when --

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,980
No,no. Pollacks aren't that
funny,dude. Try something else.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,610
So the pope says,"what are
you,a stinking evolutionist?"

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,920
Here's some fruit,boys. Better
for you than potato chips.

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,610
Jimmy,look out. There's a black widow!

25
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,100
Wow,thanks,mom! You
might have saved my life!

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,390
Dude,if I'm trying to be
creative,i can't eat fruit.

27
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,390
Doesn't your mom have something
more substantial to eat?

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,650
You can check the freezer.

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,500
There might be some frozen
fishsticks or something.

30
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,350
If you like fishsticks.

31
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,140
- Yeah,i like fishsticks.
- Wait a minute. Fishsticks.

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,120
Fish... Dicks. Oh,my
god! It's so obvious!

33
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,440
- How did I never think of it before?
- What? Dude,you got something?

34
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,500
All right. Just run
with me on this,eric.

35
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,610
Save,eric,do you like fishsticks?

36
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,570
Yeah.

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,520
You like putting fish
dicks in your mouth?

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,690
Yeah.

39
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,220
Well,what are you,eric,a gay fish?

40
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,180
Fish dicks!Oh,dude,that's funny as

41
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,790
I think we're really
onto something here.

42
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,120
Let's try it out on the guys.

43
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,380
There's clyde. Do it to clyde.

44
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,500
Yeah,yeah. Let's do it to clyde.

45
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,860
Okay. Okay,shhh! Check it out.

46
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,900
Ue,hey there,clyde.

47
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,290
What's going on?

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,630
Eric and jimmy came up
with the funniest joke ever!

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,490
Say,clyde,do you like fishsticks?

50
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,470
- Yes.
- You like to put fishsticks in your mouth?

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,900
- Yes.
- What are you,clyde,a gay fish?

52
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,480
You said you like fish dicks in
your mouth,that makes you a gay fish!

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,610
Token! Token,got a question for you.

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,990
Token,do you like fishsticks?

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,580
Fishsticks? Yeah,i guess so.

56
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,030
Butters!

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,580
You like putting
fishsticks in your mouth?

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,280
Yes.

59
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,430
- What are you,a gay fish?
- A gay fish?

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,350
Hey,look,there's kevin stoley!

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,730
Hey,kevin,do you like fishsticks?

62
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,330
Hey,hey,mackey. Do you like fishsticks?

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,680
Fishsticks? Yeah,i like fishsticks,mkay.

64
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,250
Oh,hey,peterson.
Buying fishsticks,i see.

65
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,820
Yeah,i like fishsticks.

66
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,580
What are you,peterson,a gay fish?

67
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,430
and now here he is,jimmy kimmel!

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,410
All right,hey,how we
all feeling tonight?

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,470
So let me ask the guys in
the audience a question.

70
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,540
Do you like fishsticks?

71
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,040
Yes.

72
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,930
Huh,what are you? Gay fish?

73
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,800
And so,uh,hey,paul,do
you like fishsticks,paul?

74
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,180
Uh,sure.

75
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,550
What are you,paul,a gay fish?

76
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,870
So apparently more and more
americans are eating fishsticks.

77
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,700
Have you seen this?
Have you read about this?

78
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,950
Loving fishsticks. Kind of
makes me wonder,you know?

79
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,770
What is everybody,a gay fish?

80
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,580
It is quite possibly the funniest joke
ever conceived,and its origin is unknown.

81
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,300
The fishdicks joke crosses
all borders,all races,

82
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,700
All ages and eth thick groups
and is slowly uniting our country.

83
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,850
In fact,the only person who appears to
not get the joke is rapper kanye west,

84
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,010
Who becomes furious when
people use the joke on him.

85
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,650
Yo,that is messed up,yo. I am not gay.

86
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,380
And I sure as hell
ain't no fish,all right?

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,650
You really don't get it?

88
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,270
Hey,man,I'm a genius,all right.

89
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,540
I'm the most talented
musician in the world.

90
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,780
If I was a homosexual
or a fish,i would know.

91
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,750
- You're a rapper.
- Yes!

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,040
- An entrepreneur.
- Yes.

93
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,220
- And you like fish dicks.
- Yes.

94
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,620
You're a gay fish.

95
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,890
No,I'm not no gay fish.

96
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,150
Just gay?

97
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,510
I'm not gay and I'm not a fish. Man!

98
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,900
You are male.

99
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,340
Damn right I'm male.

100
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,410
A male that likes fish dicks.

101
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,890
Yeah,i like fishsticks.

102
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,760
You like to put fish
dicks in your mouth.

103
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,750
Yeah.

104
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,340
You're a gay fish.

105
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,300
All right,that does it. I'm
gonna kick your mother ass!

106
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,510
And then it was on leno
and jimmy kimmel show!

107
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,360
Dude,that's our joke
on national television.

108
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,220
We know,cartman!

109
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,800
We are comedy writers
and you guys aren't.

110
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,710
Jimmy,I've been thinking.

111
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,640
We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.

112
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,200
- Patent?
- Yeah,dude.

113
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,620
There's lots of people out there
using our joke on their shows.

114
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,020
We should be getting compensated.

115
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,830
Well,eric,that's really
not how jokes work.

116
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,280
I mean,you know,we should just be happy that the
joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.

117
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,740
Dude,that!

118
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,740
Maybe you were writing jokes for people's
amusement,but I don't work for free.

119
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm gonna talk to a lawyer
so we get what's coming to us.

120
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,540
Jimmy,exactly what part of the
fishdicks joke did cartman write?

121
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,780
Well,he didn't actually
write any of it.He just uh --

122
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,290
let me guess. You wrote the joke and cartman
just laid on the couch eating twizzlers.

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,580
Actually,it was potato chips.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,330
I knew it! Don't let that fat
turd walk all over you,jimmy!

125
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,720
Stand up for yourself.

126
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,790
Well,i mean,he was in the room.

127
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,880
Then just give him half.

128
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,440
What?

129
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,980
I like you,jimmy. But
you're not gonna win this.

130
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,840
Consider yourself lucky
he's only asking for half.

131
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,160
Craig,if cartman didn't do anything then
he doesn't deserve any of the credit.

132
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,960
Up. And if I had wheels,i'd be a wagon.

133
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,480
No,dude,crew that!

134
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,160
Jimmy,if cartman didn't write the joke then
definitely don't sign any patent papers with him!

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,140
Just say,"cartman,you didn't have anything
to do with this joke and you know it!"

136
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,410
Just give him half.

137
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,820
There are a lot of people out there making up
rumors about me that are malicious and untrue.

138
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,970
But I am going to prove once
and for all I am not a fish.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,330
Because I am a genius,i have
ascertained that fish have gills.

140
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,700
Doctor,do I have gills?

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,150
He does not have gills.

142
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,820
You hear that? No gills.
So I can't be a fish.

143
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,770
And I'm a genius voice of
a generation,so I'm not gay.

144
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,800
So that is that. All right,it's over.

145
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,740
Now,are there any questions?

146
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,790
Do you like fishsticks?

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,570
Love 'em.

148
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,610
You're a gay fish.

149
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,140
No,I'm not!

150
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,420
All right.Recently,

151
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,670
recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke
as probable the funniest,most awesome joke ever.

152
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,650
But who originally came up with it?

153
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,340
Well,here's your
answer.Joining us tonight,

154
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,420
the brains behind the incredible fishsticks
joke,the one and only carlos mencia.

155
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,940
Yeah! Viva la mexico!

156
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,470
So,carlos,you've got a show on
comedy central,a stand-up tour.

157
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,110
Where did you have time to
come up with this classic joke?

158
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,850
Well,you know,i was just kicking
it with my homies and my brain --

159
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,600
my brain is always so full of
ideas,'cuz I'm so funny and stuff?

160
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,790
So I was all like,hey,pepeeto,you
like fishsticks?

161
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,520
And my homeboy says,"yeah,carlos,you
know,you're so funny."

162
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,280
And then it just occurred to
me,oh,man,you must be a gay fish,holmes!

163
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,130
And that's just how I
came up with it,mi amigos!

164
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,680
Mother!

165
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,080
Jimmy,dude! Did you see?

166
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,400
Carlos mencia is taking
credit for our joke.

167
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,870
- Really?
- Yeah,dude. I told you this would happen.

168
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,890
Now look,i got a lawyer to
draw up some patent papers.

169
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,850
We've got to sign these so that people
know that the joke belongs to you and me.

170
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,150
Uh,i don't know,eric.

171
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,190
I really don't think I
want to sign that,very much.

172
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,520
But jimmy,some fat turd is taking
credit for something he didn't do.

173
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,390
Well,to be perfectly frank,eric,

174
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,130
i think I came up with a little
bit more of the joke than you did.

175
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,420
What?

176
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,820
Well,you know,i mean,i basically wrote
the thing and you just kind of ate chips.

177
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,620
Jimmy,that's messed up.

178
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,240
We decided that day to write
together. Don't you remember?

179
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,530
Hey,jimmy,you wanna hang out?

180
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,320
Sorry,eric,but I gotta write some jokes.

181
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,730
Unless you wanna team up or something?

182
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,990
Team up? Okay. Let's
write some jokes together.

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,750
Here's some fishdicks,guys.
Hope you like fishdicks.

184
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,390
Do we like fishsticks?

185
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,000
What does she think we are,gay fish?

186
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,080
Ooh,look out,jimmy,it's a black widow!

187
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,970
Thanks,eric.

188
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,230
Is that,is that how it happened?

189
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,150
Look,exactly who came up with which
part of the joke isn't even relevant.

190
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,940
We had an agreement,jimmy,and
if you wanna go back on that now,

191
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,510
Well,then you're no better than a jew.

192
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm,I'm sorry.

193
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,950
It's cool,man. It's cool.

194
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,170
Here he is,y'all. Give
it up for kanye west!

195
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,270
What the hell?

196
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,480
Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!

197
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,830
Yo,this noise.

198
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,620
It just doesn't make any sense,yo!

199
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,300
Why's everyone calling me a gay fish?

200
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,800
Kanye,look,we all think it would
be better if you would just drop it.

201
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,300
You know,i mean,if you don't
get it,you don't get it.

202
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,070
What you mean I don't get it,house?

203
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,940
I'm a genius. I'll understand it.
I just need to break it down is all.

204
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,400
Now let's see. Something
about fishsticks.

205
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,540
Interacting with me.

206
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,070
Makes me gay fish.

207
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,700
- Kanye,really
-- - shut up!

208
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,230
All right,what do we
know about fishsticks?

209
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,230
They're breaded.

210
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,480
They're fried. They're frozen.

211
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,570
Then under me,we have rapper,genius.

212
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,430
Gay fish are homosexual.

213
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,170
They swim.

214
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,360
Is it because breaded has
something to do with genius?

215
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,880
Which swims?

216
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,320
No,because you said you like fish
dicks,kanye. Don't you get it?

217
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,140
You see fish dicks is a play on words.

218
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,890
I don't need anybody
telling me play on words.

219
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,790
I'm a lyrical wordsmith genius!

220
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,000
Hey,kyle,can I talk to you for a second?

221
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,720
Dude,get outta here. I'm peeing.

222
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,410
It's just,i don't know
what to do about jimmy.

223
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,130
I'm starting to think he might try and
jew me out of half of the fishsticks joke.

224
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,430
I just need you to teach me
some jew defensive moves,kyle.

225
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,100
Because we really did
both come up with it.

226
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,880
You know what,cartman? I believe you.

227
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,020
You do?

228
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,380
Yes. I believe that you believe
you helped write that joke.

229
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,980
That's how people like you work.

230
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,330
Your ego is so out of whack that it will
do whatever it can to protect itself.

231
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,260
And people with messed up ego can do these mental
gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome

232
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,150
When they're really just douche bags.

233
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,510
But I'm sure I helped come
up with the joke,didn't i?

234
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,670
Hey,jimmy,what's up,dawg?

235
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,780
Oh,hey,eric! Just working on some jokes.

236
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,350
That's cool. You wanna
write some together?

237
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,580
Hey,that'd be great!

238
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,650
I've always wanted to work with you.

239
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,960
You're really funny and
you're totally not fat.

240
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,910
Cool,thanks. Let's get to work.

241
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,170
Now,let's see. Something
that's a play on words.

242
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,070
I dunno fishsticks.
You know,'cuz of dicks.

243
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,910
You're really onto something there!

244
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,260
Hello,eric,have some chips,because
you're totally not fat at all.

245
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
Oh,thank you,mrs. Valmer.

246
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,010
Now,let's see. The set-up could
be "do you like fishsticks?"

247
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,020
Right. And then I say "yeah."

248
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,130
So then I can say,"what
are you,a gay fish?"

249
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,320
This is incredible!

250
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,170
- What is that?
- It's a dragon of some kind.

251
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,130
Don't worry,i can save you all!

252
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,900
Hey,look,eric killed a dragon!

253
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,890
He's the most awesome kid in school!

254
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,360
And he's not fat at all!

255
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,250
Thanks,you guys!

256
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,660
Nope. No,i definitely
helped write this joke.

257
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,010
All I can hope is jimmy
doesn't try to jew me over.

258
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,870
Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable
and fishsticks are crunchy?

259
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,480
Yo,kanye,kanye!

260
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,160
We found 'em,money!

261
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,190
Found who?

262
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,260
You told us to track down whoever
started the whole fishstick thang.

263
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,760
We found out who,dawg.

264
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,020
C'mon,man! What is this,man?

265
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,900
What the is going on,man?

266
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,440
Oh,,man. Kanye west.

267
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,500
Oh,no,oh,,man. Okay,look it wasn't me.

268
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,340
I didn't really start the
fishstick thing,all right?

269
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,770
You just saying that
now 'cuz you're scared!

270
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,580
No,man,it's true! I stole it,man!

271
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,460
I took credit for it,'cuz
I'm not actually funny.

272
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,930
C'mon,man. Do you know what that's like?

273
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,880
Being a comedian but not being funny?

274
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,360
Come on,kanye,i just take jokes and
repackage them with a mexican accent man.

275
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,090
You think you can make
fun of me? I'm a genius!

276
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm the voice of a
generation! What are you?

277
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,040
Nothing!

278
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,520
Look at me,man. I'm not funny.

279
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,750
I steal jokes,my dick don't work,man.

280
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,590
I got to piss in a plastic
bag,man. I got no dick!

281
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,290
I'm not gonna hurt you.

282
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,870
I pay people to do that for me.

283
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,750
Oh,oh,no,man. Come on,i got no dick,man.

284
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,220
Now,explain it to me.

285
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,440
Why do people think I'm a gay fish?

286
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,840
'Cuz,'cuz you like
fishsticks,man. C'mon,man.

287
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,480
Don't you get it?
Please,just get it,man.

288
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,870
Why? Look at me. Look at me!

289
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,460
I love fishsticks.

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,800
I love putting fishsticks in my mouth.

291
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,600
You're,you're a gay fish,man.

292
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,010
Thank you! Thank you very much!

293
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,150
Well,about a week ago our country
was blessed with the fishsticks joke.

294
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,710
And ever since then us comedians have been
kick ing ourselves for not thinking of it.

295
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,120
But today,we have with us the true
creators of the fishsticks joke.

296
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,540
Please welcome the comedy
team of cartman and valmer!

297
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,550
Hey,guys!

298
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,710
Hi,ellen.

299
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,970
You guys like fishsticks?

300
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,700
Thank you,thank you.
No,really. Thank you.

301
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,640
So,guys,i gotta ask.

302
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,060
How did you come up with
this incredible joke?

303
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,490
- It was just -- - ellen,comedy is
like a game of racquetball,you know?

304
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,490
You serve,and the other
person hits it back.

305
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,400
It bounces off the
wall,you back-hand it.

306
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,950
And it goes back and
forth and back and forth.

307
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,170
Then hopefully you've got
a good joke. Thank you.

308
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,900
But,guys,this joke is so perfect.

309
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,150
Can you explain how nobody
thought of it before?

310
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,260
Well,ellen,the
t-t- --

311
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,910
Truth of the matter is that there's
never really been a team like us before.

312
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,990
I mean,let's be perfectly honest.

313
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,820
A lot of people wouldn't work with someone
who was disabled,but I see past that.

314
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,680
I look beyond jimmy's
disabilities and find a bond.

315
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,710
Which can unite us in comedy.

316
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,850
Working with crippled
people is really important.

317
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,280
That's so great. And
are you crying,jimmy?

318
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,680
Yes,ma'am.

319
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,620
Oh,don't cry,pal. You're
gonna get me started.

320
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,530
Anyway,what was important
for us,as a team,ellen,

321
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,880
Was to make sure everyone knew that we came up
with the joke,and not charles butthole mencia.

322
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,050
I see. And did you know that carlos mencia
was found dead in his house this morning

323
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,420
With fishsticks stuffed
down his open neck hole?

324
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,130
Excuse me?

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,220
Get my jet*****

326
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,860
All right. So check it out.

327
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,160
We've got offers from van de camps and
gorton's fishermen to do commercials!

328
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,540
It's always been my dream to go on a national
tv show and talk about the craft of comedy.

329
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,870
Yeah,that was cool,huh!

330
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,860
Eric,there's something
I really need to know.

331
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,410
What's that?

332
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,270
How do you live with yourself?

333
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,030
You know you had nothing to do with the
fishsticks joke,but you just keep pretending.

334
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,020
How do you look at
yourself in the mirror?

335
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,060
That's what I want to know.

336
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,580
So. Here it is.

337
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,840
How do you take credit for
something you didn't do?

338
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,900
This is bullcrap,jimmy,and you know it!

339
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,120
I had just as much to do with
the fishsticks joke as you did.

340
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,410
Dude,it's puff daddy!

341
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,350
Tie up these mother!

342
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,460
Now,I'm gonna ask you one more time.

343
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,640
Why did you start these rumors about me?

344
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,660
Please! I wasn't
starting rumors about you.

345
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,370
I don't even know who you are!

346
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,300
Oh,right. Everyone knows who I am!

347
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,220
I want to know how this got started.

348
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,590
Well,we were just talking
about ideas for jokes and --

349
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,490
Oh,so now it's we,huh,jimmy?

350
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,350
A minute ago you said
you did it all yourself.

351
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,650
Well,i just
abu -- I bu --

352
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,680
We both came up with it together.

353
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,700
You wanna know how it happened?

354
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,500
Hello,jim.

355
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,640
Oh,boy,it's my best pal,eric!

356
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,490
What you up to?

357
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,610
I'm trying to write jokes but I'm
not as funny as you,so it's tough.

358
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,340
Well,maybe I can help
you. We can team up!

359
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,030
Really? Wow,you would help
me,even though I'm crippled?

360
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,600
You are caring and not fat.

361
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,820
Now,let's see. How about a joke that
has something to do with fishsticks.

362
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,760
You know,'cuz fishsticks
sounds like fish dicks,jimmy?

363
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,680
Eric cartman,you are handsome
and not even remotely fat.

364
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,680
Thanks.

365
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,360
So what I'm thinking is -- do
you like fishsticks in your mouth?

366
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,200
What was that?

367
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,490
Eric! Eric,you have to save us!

368
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,370
An entire army of jew robots!

369
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh,my god! What are jew bots doing here?

370
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,630
Flame on!

371
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,500
Flame off!

372
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,890
You saved everyone from
the jew-bots,cartman!

373
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,790
C'mon,jimmy,we gotta get
back and finish that joke!

374
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,170
-
- like fishsticks in your mouth?

375
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,370
What are you,a gay fish? There!

376
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,980
Wow,eric! Incredible!

377
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,050
Too bad I'm a dick and I'm
gonna take all the credit.

378
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,400
Suck it,bitch.

379
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,770
Aw,dammit. I guess it really
was all me who came up with it.

380
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,670
- What?
- You gotta let jimmy go. It's all my fault.

381
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,330
Jesus,eric. He's gonna kill you.

382
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,250
You won't even admit it was
just me knowing you're gonna die?

383
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,340
Jimmy,you really believe that you
came up with it all on your own?

384
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,040
Oh,my god. Wait. I totally get it now.

385
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,370
What? I stel don't get anything!

386
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,340
All this time I've been mad at
you,jimmy,for trying to take all the credit.

387
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,890
But now I realize it's just that your ego has
made you believe things happened differently.

388
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,630
That's what kyle was trying to tell me.

389
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,190
That you have such a huge ego you do these mental
gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.

390
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,170
Really?

391
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,900
I thought you were just trying to
jew me out of my part of the credit,

392
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,910
But now I realize that some people
just have egos that are so out of whack

393
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,330
That they distort everything and can't
rember the simple truth of what happened.

394
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,380
Jimmy,i owe you an apology.

395
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,630
I realize now you can't help
believing you created the entire joke,

396
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,220
Because your ego won't
let you think otherwise.

397
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,760
I just have to accept that.

398
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,270
Thanks,eric. For being so understanding.

399
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,500
He's right.

400
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,000
For so long I've considered
myself god's gift to the world,

401
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,850
That I couldn't take it
when people made fun of me.

402
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,950
But they weren't making fun of me.

403
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,480
They were trying to help me.

404
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,810
Boys,i understand what you did now.

405
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,900
Untie them,guys. I
know what I have to do.

406
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,600
Yo,kanye,you sure about this?

407
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,240
It's time for me to stop running.

408
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,740
I need to believe what people tell me.

409
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,050
Let all my fans know I love 'em,

410
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,820
But a gay fish just can't live
in the outside world forever.

411
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,420
Don't be sad for
me,guys. I'm going home!

412
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,000
