44
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,506
it's gay.

45
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,109
uh-huh, and what aspect of it
do you think is most gay ?

46
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,277
uh, no blood for oil !

47
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,446
yeah, war is not
my voice.

48
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,483
bush is a "nay-zee".

49
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,651
hey all you
un-american bastards !

50
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,688
if you don't like america,
why don't you get out ?

51
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,989
yeah !

52
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,724
don't you call us
un-american !

53
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,628
this country was founded on
the right to protest, m'kay !

54
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,929
yeah !

55
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,098
if the founding fathers
saw you burning your flag

56
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,833
and calling the
president a nazi,

57
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,002
they'd roll over
in their graves !

58
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,303
yeah !
yeah !

59
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,906
the founding fathers would agree
with our right to protest.

60
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,376
the founding fathers would
kick all your asses !

61
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:27,714
boys, what do you think the
founding fathers would say ?

62
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,449
the foggy who ?

63
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,654
well, i hope
you little commies

64
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,823
are pretty pleased
with yourselves--

65
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,558
going out there
and protesting america

66
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,293
and then saying on
national television

67
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,896
that you don't even know
who the founding fathers are !

68
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,799
you kids don't know squat
about america, do you ?!

69
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,402
well, not really, no.

70
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,703
well, that's just jingles.

71
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,438
because i'm assigning
all you little flag-burners

72
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,342

and the founding fathers !

73
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,644
( all )

74
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,945
shut up !

75
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,246
i want you all in your
study groups of four,

76
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,548
and if you can't give an
outstanding report

77
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,584
on what the founding fathers
would have to say

78
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,753
about all this protesting,
then it's "f"s for you !

79
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,922
( bell rings )

80
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,561
eh...

81
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,031
eh heh...

82
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,332
i can't do it.

83
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,501
this is way too much
material for a 9-year-old.

84
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,670
yeaagh !

85
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,537
oh, no you don't,
cartman !

86
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,838
every time we get put
in a study group

87
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,007
you sit on ass while the
rest of us do all the work !

88
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,742
but you guys are such
better studiers than me.

89
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,044
i know you can
pull it off.

90
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,213
you're gonna read this stuff
and study like the rest of us !

91
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,683
myaaa !  mya !

92
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,418

93
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,020
myaaaa,
mya, mya.

94
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,503
hmm, 1776,

95
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,672
when our founding fathers
created america.

96
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,275
i wonder what it used to
be like in those days.

97
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,444
in those days.
in those days.

98
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,179
in those days.

99
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,480
what are you doing ?

100
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,215
i'm trying to have
a flashback.

101
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,083
a what ?

102
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,384
you know, if i have
a flashback

103
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,553
then i can see what 1776
was like firsthand.

104
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,854
no, you just
have to study.

105
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,155
no, i've seen this
work before,

106
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,457
just give me a second.

107
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,192
oh, okay,
how about this ?

108
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,794
say, guys,
1776 was so long ago,

109
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,963
i wonder what life would
have been like back then.

110
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,698
back then.
back then.

111
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,301
back then.

112
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,241
oh wait, i know--

113
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,844
you know, guys, i don't
even care about 1776 !

114
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,013
it was so long ago

115
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,314
that i don't think it has
anything to do with me.

116
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,350
with me.
with me.

117
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,085
anything to do
with me, with me.

118
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,820
that isn't gonna work,
dumb-ass !

119
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,989
kids, let's keep it down
for study groups

120
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,592
or else mr. garrison's
going to punish me.

121
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,761
just face it, cartman, you're
going to have to study !

122
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,231
myaaa !
mya, myaaa !

123
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,002
there, all finished !

124
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,472
from now on, this is
the pro-war side of the town

125
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,207
and that's the
unpatriotic side.

126
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,942
yeah !
that's right !

127
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,111
how about we call this
the rational side of town

128
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,280
and that the
redneck side !

129
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,581
( laughter )

130
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,317
you just keep all
your flag burning

131
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,353
and your hippie rock protest
songs on your side of the town !

132
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,088
hey, wait a minute.

133
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,257
your side of town
has the post office.

134
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,426
well, your side has
the grocery store.

135
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,594
you can come to our side
to use the post office

136
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,197
if we can go to your side
to use the grocery store.

137
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,800
uh, can we cross the line
to take our kids to school ?

138
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,968
well, naturally you can
cross the line for that,

139
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,571
just like we can cross
for hardware supplies, gas

140
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,872
and pharmaceutical needs.

141
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,174
yeah, okay,
yeah, sure.

142
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,210
hey everybody, this is
never gonna work.

143
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,511
don't you see ?

144
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,548
all this dividin' up the town--
it's just ridiculous.

145
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,283
what we really
should be doing

146
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,319
is just beating the hell out of
each other like we were.

147
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,054
he's right.

148
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,657
boy, do i feel
like a fool.

149
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,994
cartman, what the hell
are you doing ?

150
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,296
you're supposed to
be studying !

151
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,597
that's what i'm doing.

152
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,898
i'm about to find out
all about what happened

153
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,200
back in 1776.

154
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,501
how ?

155
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,802
all i have to do is be thinking
about american history

156
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,104
when i walk through
this doorway.

157
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,839
i'll trip the rope, causing
the rock to fall on my head,

158
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,574
and then i will
have a flashback

159
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,309
to the times of our
founding fathers !

160
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,478
cartman, you are hereby declared
a full-fledged retard.

161
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,213
ha-ha, make fun of me
all you want, kyle,

162
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,514
but i will have
the last laugh.

163
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,117
gentlemen, if you will clear
the doorway, please ?

164
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,322
( clears throat )

165
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,623
oh, gee, i wonder what it
used to be like

166
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,792
in the year 1776 ?

167
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,395
eh !

168
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,033
derh.
derh...

169
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,636
cartman ?
cartman !

170
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,937
benjamin franklin ?

171
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:45,805
no, turd pants,

172
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,106
kyle.

173
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:51,878
get-out-of-my-flashback,
you-god-damn-jew.

174
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,348
rabble, rabble !
rabble !

175
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,950
okay, people, what are we
rabbling about now ?

176
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,685
mayor, our peace rally

177
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,421
has always been set
for this saturday,

178
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,156
and now these
pro-war bastards

179
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,758
are suddenly trying to say
they get the town square.

180
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,493
that's bullcrap, mayor !

181
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,662
our rally to support the war
was setup months ago.

182
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,698
there was no war
months ago !

183
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,169
hey, if you don't like america
then you can get out !

184
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,470
look, nobody wants to hear
a bunch of twangy

185
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,072
country music
pro-war propaganda !

186
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,675
nobody wants to hear a bunch
of rock protest songs !

187
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,976
yeah !

188
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,711
up yours, rednecks !

189
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,013
rabble, rabble,
rabble !

190
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,314
quiet, people !

191
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,049
the town square
is public space.

192
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,652
that means if neither group
will nicely and maturely

193
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:33,953
move the day of its rally,

194
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,556
i'll just have to give the
town square to both groups.

195
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,291
alright, that's fine,

196
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,592
because our
war support songs

197
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,327
will be a thousand
times better !

198
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,062
oh, you think so ?
bring the shizzle.

199
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,797
we'll trizzle that shizzle
all over the hizzle.

200
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,098
yeah ?

201
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,701
see you saturday, mckizzer
shanizzernilla shnazz

202
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,436
beyaznatch kazizza.

203
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,605
cartman ?
cartman ?

204
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,340
you better be studying,
god dammit.

205
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,376
ah, stan, kyle, kenny--
you're just in time.

206
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,678
oh, no.

207
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,979
oh yes !  i am just
about to flashback

208
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,280
to the days of our
founding fathers.

209
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,582
cartman, you're supposed
to be studying !

210
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:03,883
what the hell
is all this ?!

211
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,184
i have programmedtivo

212
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,486
to record over 50 hours
ofthe history channel.

213
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,221
when the tivo is full,
both tivo and i will be

214
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,088
dropped into the water,

215
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,389
combining our
electro-whatever fields,

216
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,124
and sending me into
a flashback of history.

217
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,293
uh, cartman, i think that's
a really bad idea.

218
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,028
or a really sweet one.

219
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,763
( ding )
your tivo is full.

220
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,631
oh, here it goes !

221
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,909
cartman ?

222
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,210
cartman ?

223
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,945
aw, crap.

224
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,621
oh, awesome !

225
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:42,922

227
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,525
yeah, yeah, can you
tell me what year it is ?

228
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,392

229
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,127

into town ?

232
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,332
i'm on my way to master
thomas jefferson's house

233
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,067

document, i am.

234
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,104

237
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,309

i'm having a flashback.

238
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,912
a flashback ?

239
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,948

oh, awesome !

240

? look at me
i'm back in time, in 1776 ?

241
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,587
? with gaslight corners
cobblestone streets ?

242
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,756
? and humble houses
made of bricks ?

243
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,358
? what a special
magic time ?

244
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,527
? and it's all
alive for me ?

245
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,828
? i'm so glad
stan and kyle aren't here ?

246
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,732
? i hate those guys
seriously ?

247
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,901
? seriously hate
those guys ?

248
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,636
? hate stan & kyle ??

249
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,910
is he going to be
alright, doctor ?

250
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,645
your son tried to
kill himself

251
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,814
in a ritualistic fashion
i've never seen before.

252
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,549
his chances of surviving
are very slim.

253
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,718
i'm so sorry.

254
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,887
oh baby, baby,
you can't die !

255
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,622
yeah, we have a report
to do, asshole !

256
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,791
get up !
get up !

257
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,092
ooh, easy, kyle.

258
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,393
but it's not fair !

259
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:55,695
we have to do a full report
on the founding fathers

260
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,430
and cartman got out of
helping us again !

261
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,731
i guess we're just
gonna have to do it

262
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,599
with the three of us.

263
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,334
come on, guys.

264
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,502
i know you're in a very dark
place now, sweetie,

265
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,237
but you must come
toward the light.

266
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,406
come toward light !

267
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,141
'ere we are, then,

268
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,310
the current residence of
master thomas jefferson !

269
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,045
super neat-o !

270
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,648
i'm afraid you'll
have to wait here.

271
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,383
but i need to talk to
the founding fathers

272
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,250
to do my report.

273
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,986
sorry, only the
official messenger boy

274
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,721
is allowed to talk to
mr. jefferson.

275
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,625
oh, okay,
i guess i understand.

276
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,926
? i don't wanna wait ?

277
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,661
? for our lives
to be over ??

278
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,565
( screaming )

279
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,674
hello, i am
thomas jefferson.

280
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,276
and i am the official
messenger boy, i am !

281
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,614
very well, take this document
to the continental congress.

282
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,349
wow, the declaration of
independence day.

283
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,518
some favor going to war
with england

284
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,121
and others want to
avoid war at all costs.

285
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,422
it's a bitch, ain't it ?

286
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,157
perhaps this document will
make the reasons for war

287
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,458
obvious to all.

288
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,928
good luck, young messenger,
now make haste !

289
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,832
okay, so thomas jefferson wrote
the declaration of independence,

290
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,567
then the continental
congress--

291
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,736
no war !
no war !

292
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,038
no war !

293
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,339
oh, jesus.

294
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,640
uh, boys, would you mind
clearing the living room ?

295
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,375
we have to practice our
big war protest song.

296
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,677
dad, we have to study !

297
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,978
mr. garrison is making us
do a presentation

298
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,147
on what the founding fathers
would say about the war.

299
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,749
hey, that's
a terrific idea !

300
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:24,617
yeah !

301
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:25,918

do their presentation

302
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,087
as part of our peace rally
on saturday !

303
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,822

308
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,497
un-american traitors ?

309
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,799
i'm doing my
homework.

310
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,967
the boys are going to give
a presentation atourrally

311
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,269
about how the founding
fathers would agree

312
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,004
with our right
to protest.

313
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,305
what ?

314
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,474
actually, we hadn't
really come to a--

315
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,510
look, my son is a patriot
and loves his country !

316
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,812
come on, kenny !

317
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,113

322
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,090
can you believe those
hick sons a bitches ?

323
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,258
manipulating their kids
into being on their side !

324
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,560
disgraceful !

325
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,729
stan and kyle, it's up to you
to show all those war mongerers

326
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,897
that the founding fathers
agree with us !

327
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,066
( man )
yeah, that's right,
let's get back to work.

328
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,801
do you think kids
in every town

329
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,536
have to deal with
this crap ?

330
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,043
( man )
enter, young messenger !

331
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,019
i am john hancock,
president of the congress.

332
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,755
wow !

333
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,622
mr. john adams ?

334
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,923
aye.

335
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,658
will you do the honors of
reading the document

336
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,827
to congress, please ?

337
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,864
when in the course
of human events,

338
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,599
it becomes necessary
for one people to...

339
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,334
we mutually pledge
to each other,

340
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:53,539
our lives our fortunes
and our sacred honor.

341
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,310
p.s. every thursday should be
free ice cream day.

342
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,949
excuse me, but does this
declaration actually suggest

343
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,118
that we should go to war
with england ?

344
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,287
we have no choice,
mr. dickenson.

345
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,022
( shouting )

346
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,926
alright, everyone,
thank you all for coming out

347
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,529
to protest the war, m'kay !

348
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,396
( applause )

349
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,131
don't kid yourselves !

350
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,734
these people have come out to
support our troops, right ?!

351
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,903
( applause )

352
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,505
and now, randy marsh is
gonna sing a protest song

353
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,240
he wrote about the war--

354
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,975
oh no, you don't !

355
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,144
we're doing our
pro-war song first !

356
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,879
yeah !  the last thing
these people want

357
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,482
is another bleeding-heart
rock protest song !

358
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,518
people, i told you,
you have to share the stage.

359
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:43,422
nobody wants to hear another
pro-war country song !

360
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,591
well, excuse me if--

361
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,495
? i'm a little bit
country ?

362
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,097
? well, i'm a little bit
rock n' roll-a ?

363
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,568
? i'm a little for
supportin' our troops ?

364
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,038
? and i'm a little for
bringin' 'em home ?

365
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,207
? i believe freedom
isn't free ?

366
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,942
? no, but war
shouldn't be our goal ?

367
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,544
? we must defend
our country ?

368
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,581
? if it means war
than we say no ?

369
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,087
? did you forget them
towers in new york ? ?

370
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,425
? did you forget
how it made you feel ?

371
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,461
? to see them
towers come down ? ?

372
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,497
? were you like me
did you think ?

373
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,100
? it weren't real ? ?

374
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,004
? i like to rock, but i don't
want to rock iraq ?

375
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,775
? the only kind of rockin'
america should do ?

376
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,812
? is the kind that we
can all dance to ?

377
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,848
? we've got g.p.s.
i.c.b.m.s ?

378
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,885
? and good
ol' fashion lead ?

379
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,921
? we're gonna show saddam
what america means ?

380
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,391
? that son of a bitch
will be dead ?

381
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,994
? why are we
fightin' this war ? ?

382
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,464
? there's a man in the office
we didn't vote for ?

383
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,199
? they didn't
give me a choice ?

384
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,103
? war is not my voice
yeah ?

385
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,272
( shouting )

386
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,175
we must go to war !

387
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,477
but what about
the violence,

388
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,778
the lives lost ?

389
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,079
if we found a country

390
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,248
it should be founded on
peace and diplomacy !

391
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,285
england will only understand
one thing-- force.

392
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,020
i must state again
for the record

393
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,755
that south carolina,
north carolina,

394
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,791
pennsylvania, maryland and
georgia are against war !

395
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,526
yeah, because
you don't care about

396
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,695
the fate of the colonies
like we do.

397
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,996
you're all unpatriotic !

398
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,900
if you don't like the colonies,
then you can get out !

399
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,201
don't you call us
unpatriotic !

400
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,937
we are protesting
this war because

401
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,539
we care so deeply for
the fate of our colonies !

402
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,274
you are all unpatriotic
for leading the colonies

403
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,311
into a war that
half of them don't want !

404
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,612
( shouting )

405
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,781
whoa, how very,
very relevant.

406
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,619
tom, i'm standing
in the town square

407
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,920
where the war rally
has been going on

408
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,523
for an incredible
87 hours.

409
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,125
the crowd still appears to
split right down the middle.

410
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,162
half support country music and
the other half rock n' roll.

411
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,463
let's listen in.

412
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,632
and now we'd like to bring out
a couple of very special

413
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,367
south park students

414
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,102
who did a report on
what the founding fathers

415
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,271
would have to say
about the war.

416
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,006
( applause )

417
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,476
( all )
boo !

418
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,079
for you people who still
think war is the answer,

419
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,983
perhaps you can listen to
the voices of the children.

420
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,489
uh, we didn't do it.

421
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,790
what ?

422
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,959
we didn't do
our homework.

423
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,694
boys !  you were supposed
to come up here

424
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,863
and tell everyone about
the founding fathers !

425
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,598
well, first we lost
one study partner

426
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,899
when cartman put himself
in the hospital,

427
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,201
and then they
took kenny away.

428
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,502
and then kyle forgot to
set his clock ahead

429
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,803
for daylight savings
and we couldn't find anything

430
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,105
in the history books
about iraq and--

431
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,840
that's because
the founding fathers

432
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,575
would have supported
the war !

433
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,611
the founding fathers would
have protested like us !

434
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,479
support !

435
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,780
protest !

436
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,647
country !

437
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,816
rock n' roll !

438
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,962
rabble !  rabble !
rabble !...

439
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,866
we cannot found a country
based on war !

440
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,770
we cannot found a country
that is afraid to fight !

441
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,637
rabble !

442
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,806
rabble !
rabble !

443
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,107
( murmuring )

444
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,409
oh, benjamin franklin.

445
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,276
benjamin franklin.

446
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,577
it's mr. franklin.

447
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,312
oh, benjamin franklin.
franklin, franklin.

448
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,614
benjamin franklin.

449
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,518
mr. franklin, where do you
stand on the war issue ?

450
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,422
i believe that if we are
to form a new country

451
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,892
we cannot be a country that
appears war-hungry and violent

452
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,627
to the rest
of the world.

453
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,796
however, we also
cannot be a country

454
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,398
that appears weak and
unwilling to fight

455
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,133
to the rest of the world.

456
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,603
so, what if we
form a country--

457
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:55,074
that appears
to want both ?

458
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,676
yes.
yes, of course.

459
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,411
we go to war.

460
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,448
and protest going to war
at the same time !

461
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,315
right !

462
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,616
if the people of
our new country

463
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,918
are allowed to do
whatever they wish

464
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,954
then some will support the war
and some will protest it.

465
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,123
and that means
that as a nation

466
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,292
we could go to war
with whomever we wished

467
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,762
but at the same time
act like we didn't want to.

468
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,497
if we allow the people

469
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,666
to protest what
the government does,

470
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,268
then the country will be
forever blameless !

471
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,172
it's like having your cake
and eating it too.

472
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,642
think of it, an entire nation
founded on saying one thing

473
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,377
and doing another.

474
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,546
and we will
call that country

475
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,583
the united states
of america.

476
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:38,884
wow !

477
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,487
i get it now !
i get it !

478
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,222
whoa, here it goes.

479
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,523
i wish i could
go back to my time.

480
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,559
to my time.
to-to my time.

481
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,162
wow !

482
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,211
everyone, stop,
please !

483
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,946
the-- the child.

484
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,681
the child
from the hospital !

485
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,152
if you all don't mind, i would
like to do my report now.

486
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,320
i know what the
founding fathers would say.

487
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,622
he does ?

488
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,489
he does ?

489
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,224
i learned
something today.

490
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,959
this country was founded by
some of the smartest thinkers

491
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,261
the world has ever seen.

492
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,562
and they knew
one thing:

493
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,297
that a truly great country
can go to war

494
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,333
and at the same time
act like it doesn't want to.

495
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,502
you people
who are for the war--

496
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,803
you need the protestors

497
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,105
because they make
the country look like

498
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,840
it's made of sane,
caring individuals.

499
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,141
and you people
who are anti-war--

500
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,442
you need these
flag wavers

501
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,178
because if our whole
country was made up

502
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,913
of nothing but soft,
pussy protestors

503
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,648
we'd get taken down
in a second.

504
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,816
that's why the founding fathers
decided we should have both.

505
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,287
it's called having your cake
and eating it too.

506
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,022
he's right.

507
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,757
the strength of this country
is the ability

508
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,492
to do one thing
and say another.

509
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,528
yeah, if it weren't for
all you guys protesting

510
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,131
everyone around the world
would hate the american people

511
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,866
instead of
just the president.

512
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,035
and if it weren't for
you people flexing your arms

513
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,939
america could easily get taken
over by terrorists, or china.

514
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,541
i guess we owe you
an apology.

515
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,710
i guess
we owe you one.

516
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,746
( everyone )
aw...

517
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,952
cartman ?
cartman saved the day ?

518
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,253
it can't be.

519
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,988
the founding fathers
want you all to know

520
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,289
that we can disagree
all we want,

521
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,458
as long as we agree
that america kicks ass.

522
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,494
? hey, i'm a little
bit country ?

523
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,965
? and i'm a little bit
