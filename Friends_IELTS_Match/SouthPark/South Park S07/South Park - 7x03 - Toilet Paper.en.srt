feel the clay.

00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,477
( all mischivously giggling )

21
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,212

25
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,888
you four boys never take
art class seriously !

26
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,755
what a crime.

27
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,358
you think art
is not important ?

28
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,394
well, art's just kinda...
for gaywads.

29
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,262
i love art class !

30
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,563

32
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,768
do you think this is
funny, huh ?!

33
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,805
( snickering )

34
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,540

spend your afternoon

35
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,010

36
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,179

37
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,914

i'm your teacher.

38
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,215

00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,950

40
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,986
mrs. streibel thinks

like that !

42
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,023
yeah, she's a...
( garbled )

43
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,192
we can't let her
get away with this.

44
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,360
i think tonight we need
to something drastic.

45
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,228
like what ?

46
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,397
like find out where
mrs. streibel lives.

47
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,264
and go over there.

48
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,867
and...
t.p. her house.

49
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,602
yeah !

50
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,903
t.p. her house ?

51
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,638
toilet paper-- cover her
house in toilet paper.

52
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,940
oh.

53
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,675
what's the matter, kyle,
you chicken ?

54
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,277
bawk bawk,
bawk bawk bawk.

55
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,145
ahh !

56
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,446
quiet, boys !

57
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,615
this isn't play time,
you're being punished !

58
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,350
fine.

59
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,651
but we'll have the last laugh
tonight, art whore.

60
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,688
yeah, payback time,
you ugly skank.

61
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,628
you think
that's enough ?

62
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,929
should be fine.

63
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,231
don't you guys think this is
a little suspicious.

64
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,966
we should buy something else
so it doesn't look obvious.

65
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,267
okay.

66
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,002
here we go,
a pack of chewing gum.

67
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,171
hello boys, find
everything you need ?

68
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,472
yup, all set.

69
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,207
okay, let's see here,
toilet paper.

70
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,244
toilet paper.
toilet paper.

71
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,545
toilet paper.

72
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,280
toilet paper.

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,015
so, what are you kids
up to tonight ?

74
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,316
oh, we're just gonna
watch some tv,

75
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,618
maybe play a board game.

76
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,919
nice relaxing
night at home, huh ?

77
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,654
toilet paper,
toilet paper.

78
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,389
and toilet paper.

79
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,690
hey, hey--

80
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,859
now you kids be careful
with this chewing gum.

81
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,594
don't go sticking it
under tables.

82
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,896
okay.

83
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,064
okay, toilet paper,
toilet paper.

84
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,799
toilet paper.

85
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,968
y'know, son, i remember you
coming in last week

86
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,270

87
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,571
oh, yeah,

88
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,740

89
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,475

90
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,210

91
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,945
oh.

92
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,812

93
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,319
is this
the right house ?

94
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,187
it's the right address.

95
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,488
wait, look there !

96
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,789
there's mrs. streibel !
this is the place !

97
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,693
( kyle )
oh wait, wait,

98
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,994
so ?

99
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:15,862
so i'm not t.p.'ing a house
with kids inside it.

100
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,597
kyle, we all
agreed to do this.

101
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,332
we didn't say nothin' about
no kids, man !

102
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,633
kyle, you're being
an asshole.

103
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,670
let's do this thing
and get out of here.

104
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,971
here's what i think
of your art class,

105
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,838
you god damn bitch !

106
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,574
( kenny )
yeah, ---k you !

107
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,600
come on, let's go !

108
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,202
what have we done ?

109
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,371
let's go, kyle !

110
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,010
( panting )

111
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,046
we're in trouble.

112
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,348
we're in
so much trouble !

113
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,083
oh man,
that was so awesome !

114
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,384
how can you say that ?

115
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,685
did you see what we did
to their house ?

116
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:13,987
it'll take them days
to clean that up !

117
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,288
who cares ?

118
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,155
well, you don't,

119
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,457
because you're an uncaring
asshole, cartman !

120
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,192
me ?

121
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,662
there's toilet paper
on your hands too, kyle.

122
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,963
cartman's right, kyle.

123
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,132
we're all in this
together.

124
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,903
no, no.

125
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,072
no !

126
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,807
( scream )

127
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,542
honey, what is it ?

128
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,145
oh, jesus, no,
our house !

129
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,880
( both crying )
mommy !

130
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,181
mommy !

131
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,916
why ?!

132
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,085
why ?!

133
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:46,953
ah !

134
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,688
oh god.
oh god.

135
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,893
hey, did you guys hear what
happened last night ?

136
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,496
mrs. streibel's house got
covered with toilet paper.

137
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,665
yeah, they say it's gonna take
three weeks to get it all down.

138
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,701
yeah, well, ol' mrs. streibel
probably had it coming to her.

139
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,002
i don't know.

140
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,171
i don't think anybody deserves
that kind of brutality.

141
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,906
well, i understand the people
who did it weren't caught,

142
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,075
so looks like nobody will
ever know the geniuses

143
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,244
who masterminded
that perfect crime.

144
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,979
( bell rings )

145
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,714
okay, children,
let's take our seats.

146
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,449
oh, uh-- stan, kyle,
eric and kenny--

147
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,184
the counselor wants to see you
in his office now.

148
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,485
damn !

149
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,220
oh god !

150
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,389
how the hell did they
find out it was us

151
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,691
that t.p.'d that house ?

152
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:25,992
will you relax, kyle ?

153
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,293
they've got
nothing on us.

154
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,028
as long as we all stick to
our story we'll be fine.

155
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,763
we better go over our story
again so we don't screw it up.

156
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,800
okay, last night all four of us
were at the bowling alley

157
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,968
until about 7:30, at which time
we noticed ally sheedy,

158
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,137
the goth chick from
"the breakfast club",

159
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,872
was bowling in the
lane next to us

160
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,740
and we asked for her autograph,
but she didn't have a pen

161
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,041
so we followed her
out to her car,

162
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,343
but on the way we were accosted
by five scientologists

163
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,644
who wanted to give us all
personality tests

164
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,945
which were administered
at the scientology center

165
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,246
in denver until 10:45,

166
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,548
at which time we accidentally
boarded the wrong bus home

167
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,717
and ended up in
rancho de fritas rejos,

168
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,018
south of castle rock,

169
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,319
and finally got a ride
home with a man

170
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,620
who was missing his left index
finger named gary bushwell,

171
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,223
arriving home at 11:46.

172
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,524
i'm confused.

173
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,826
did ally sheedy take
the personality test ?

174
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,693
yes, dude !

175
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,994
kyle, it's very simple.

176
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,296
we followed ally sheedy out
to her car, but on the way

177
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,597
we were accosted by
five scientologists

178
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,898
who wanted to give us all
personality tests

179
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,633
which were administered
at the scientology center

180
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,935
in denver until 10:45,
at which time

181
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,236
we accidentally boarded
the wrong bus home

182
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,537
and ended up in
rancho de fritas rejos,

183
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:12,839
south of castle rock,

184
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,140
and finally got
a ride home with a man

185
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,441
who was missing his left index
finger named gary bushewell,

186
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,176
arriving home at 11:46.

187
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,044
you got it ?!

188
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,345
i... i can't.

189
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:20,646
oh, for christ's sake !

190
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,948
look, kyle, just let cartman
do all the talking, okay ?

191
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,249
he's better at being
in trouble than anybody.

192
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,984
thank you, stan.

193
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,285
shh, shh-- here they come,
here they come.

194
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,020
and so i said, "that's
a terrific joke, wendy,

195
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,322
tell us another one !"

196
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,924
oh hello, mr. mackey are you
ready to see us now ?

197
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,527
we're gonna talk to you
one at a time, boys, m'kay.

198
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,563
kenny, will you step
into my office, please ?

199
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,431
me ?

200
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,600
come on, kenny,
let's go, m'kay.

201
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,937
touche, mr.mackey,
touche.

202
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:45,805
why are they doing us
one at a time ?

203
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,974
they want to see if
we mix the story up.

204
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,275
and see if somebody will
rat out the other three

205
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,576
for a better deal.

206
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,878
i can get
a better deal ?

207
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,179
kyle, so help me god,

208
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,914
if you jew us out on this one
i will ( bleeping ) kill you !

209
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,818
there we go, that should be
about the last of it.

210
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,553
( humming )

211
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,192
excuse me, uh,
what are you doing ?

212
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,361
crime scene investigation.

213
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,530
there are several
footprints in the snow--

214
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,265
perhaps more than one
perpetrator ?

215
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,000
uh, look,
we really don't want to

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,301
make a big deal
out of this.

217
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,602
is that the
toilet paper there ?

218
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,771
i'll need to take
those bags as evidence.

219
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,940
look, it's just not
that big a deal.

220
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,976
i mean, i toilet-papered houses
myself when i was a kid.

221
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:24,844
you ?!

222
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,013
so where were you
last night at around nine ?

223
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,748
i was here !

224
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,917
aha !  got you !

225
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,085
officer, why would i
t.p. my own house ?

226
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,821
insurance ?

227
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,122
it wasn't me, okay ?

228
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,989
now if you
don't mind

229
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,724
i just want to get my yard
back to normal.

230
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,026
now you listen to me--

231
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,327
whoever t.p.'d your house

232
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,062
is still out there
roaming the streets.

233
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,363
it's only a matter of time
before another house

234
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,532
and another family
is victimized !

235
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,701
i have to stop that
from happening.

236
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,171
you really have nothing
better to do, do you ?

237
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,906
no, i do not.

238
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,111
no, no.

239
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,847
no !

240
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,015
( scream )

241
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,184
oh, jesus, no,
our house !

242
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,787
mommy !
mommy !

243
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,389
why, why ?!

244
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,124
why ?!

245
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,860
( sobbing )

246
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,330
oh god !
oh god !

247
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,065
i have to
tell the truth !

248
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,366
mom !!

249
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,667
( panting )

250
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,704
hello, kyle.
going somewhere ?

251
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,306
i was...

252
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,041
i was just going to
get a drink of water.

253
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,644
no need-- i have one
for you right here.

254
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,548
oh, okay, thanks.

255
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,283
is there anything else
i can get for you ?

256
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,319
no, i'll just...
be going back to bed now.

257
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,187
you do that.

258
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,488
good night, kyle.

259
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,428
josh myers t.p.'d over 600
houses in less than a year.

260
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,730
he's a real monster.

261
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,465
i just need to
talk to someone

262
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,067
who knows how
toilet-paperers think.

263
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,369
just remember:

264
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,670
he'd toilet paper you
in a second

265
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,706
if he had the chance.

266
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,441
he's the last cell
on your left.

267
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,322
hello, josh, my name is
officer barbrady,

268
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,925
i'm with the
south park police.

269
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,660
( "hannibal lecter" voice )
that's a terrible cologne
you're wearing, officer,

270
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,262
you should try something
more... casual.

271
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,732
i was hoping you could help me
solve a toilet papering case.

272
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,034
and why would i do that ?

273
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,202
because i'm such a
charming fella ?

274
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:35,841
please, i need your help,
what would you want in return ?

275
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,143
due to the harsh nature
of my crimes

276
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,878
they don't allow me to have
toilet paper in my cell.

277
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,047
you can imagine how
bothersome that becomes.

278
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,384
you know i can't give you
toilet paper, josh.

279
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,119
no, but it was worth
a try, wasn't it ?

280
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,421
tell me something,
officer,

281
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,156
why is it that you police
such a small town ?

282
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,457
you must've had
larger inspirations.

283
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,060
what happened to those
big city dreams ?

284
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,228
wul, that's kinda
personal.

285
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,530
quid pro quo, officer.

286
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,831
tell me what
i want to know,

287
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,301
and i'll help you catch whoever
toilet-papered that house.

288
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,240
look, kid, i have
very little time to catch

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,542
whoever toilet-papered
that house.

290
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,711
tell me what you know.

291
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,446
are those the
crime scene photos ?

292
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,747
let me see them.

293
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,952
yes, yes.

294
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,555
not bad work,
not bad at all.

295
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,290
these toilet-paperers
are professionals--

296
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,591
at least,
one of them is.

297
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,760
so you think there was
more than one-- why ?

298
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,061
tellmesomething first.

299
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,363
when you went to the academy,
you had something to prove--

300
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,098
you wanted to
protect and serve,

301
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,399
but mostly you just
wanted to protect, yourself.

302
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,002
who were you protecting yourself
from, officer barbrady ?

303
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,303
alright, alright !

304
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,604
my uncle charles used to
hit me with a belt !

305
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,773
waaah !

306
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,074
thank you.

307
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,809
your toilet-paperers
are most likely males

308
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,111
between the ages of eight and
ten, and probably virgins.

309
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,846
parents notice that much
toilet paper missing

310
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,147
so they would've had to
have bought it themselves.

311
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,448
find out where the toilet paper
came from, officer,

312
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,617
and you just might
catch your man.

313
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,786
( bell rings )

314
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,822
stan, kenny-- can i talk
to you guys for a second ?

315
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,991
i think we have the counselor
and the principal fooled,

316
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,726
but we need to
talk about kyle.

317
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,594
what about him ?

318
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,895
come on, you know !

319
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,630
i think so too.
he's losing it.
he's gonna crack.

320
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,931
kyle can't take the heat

321
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,233
and he's gonna sing
like a canary.

322
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,534
then we're all gonna take
the fall for what we did.

323
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,835
hey fellas !

324
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,570
butters.

325
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,739
( sniffs )

326
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,342
( clears throat )

327
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,848
look, you guys, all it takes
is for one of us crack.

328
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,150
and we all know who
the weakest link is.

329
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,451
so what should we do ?

330
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,054
we have no choice--
we have to kill kyle.

331
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,789
dude, we're not
killing kyle !

332
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,656
yeah !

333
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,391
why not ?!

334
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,693
kyle's not gonna say
anything, alright ?

335
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,994
he almost spilled the beans
in the counselor's office.

336
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,295
he can't even keep
the story straight !

337
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,596
i'm telling you guys,
he's weak.

338
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,067
he's weak, and he'll be
the end of us all.

339
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,103
you wanted to see me,
officer barbrady ?

340
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,404
yes, thanks for coming,
mr.bell.

341
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,139
a house was t.p.'d
in south park

342
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,308
and i need to see if you can
identify the toilet paper

343
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,043
i recovered
from the scene.

344
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,080
i'm sorry i have to
do this.

345
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,682
( gagging )

346
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,983
oh my god.

347
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,719
is this toilet paper
from your store ?

348
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,622
it's... difficult to tell,
it's so decayed.

349
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,924
i--
wait a minute, yes.

350
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,659
yes, i recognize the
floral pattern now.

351
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,828
positive i.d.
on the toilet paper.

352
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,996
who would do this
to toilet paper, who ?

353
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,298
mr. bell, do you remember
anyone suspicious

354
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,467
buying toilet paper
in the last few days ?

355
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,202
suspicious like how ?

356
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,370
well, like someone
who was black or mexican

357
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,672
or middle eastern ?

358
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,407
no, the only mexican guy
i recall

359
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,142
bought toaster tarts
and chips.

360
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,178
and we don't allow middle
eastern people in the store.

361
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,046
oh my god.

362
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,781
bleahhhh !

363
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,251
what's this
all about, cartman ?

364
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,552
i just wanted to see how
you're doing, kyle.

365
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,287
why don't we go out for
a little boat ride ?

366
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,589
a boat ride ?

367
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,324
i just thought we should find
a private place to talk.

368
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,625
well, okay.

369
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,926
could you help me put this
cement block and chain

370
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,228
into the boat ?

371
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,903
okay, let's go.

372
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,747
so how are things, kyle ?

373
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,048
terrible.

374
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,350
every time i close my eyes
i see the house we t.p.'d.

375
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,651
i see the tears
of our art teacher

376
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,386
and hear the screams
of her daughters.

377
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,555
and you feel like
you have to confess.

378
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,290
i don't know what to do.

379
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,459
part of me feels like
i have to end it all now,

380
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,628
tell people what happened.

381
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,098
y'know, i never noticed how
beautiful this pond was before.

382
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,833
so calm.

383
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,134
the world can
be like that--

384
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,869
so calm on the outside.

385
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,604
as if nothing bad
ever happens.

386
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,773
( tap )

387
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,074
ow !

388
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,376
what the hell are you
doing, cartman ?

389
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,677
i'm killing you.

390
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:32,545
but unfortunately i could
only afford a whiffle bat,

391
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,846
so it's gonna take a while.

392
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,147
cartman !

393
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,448
don't fight it, kyle,
it will only take longer.

394
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,485
just slip into
sweet unconsciousness.

395
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,786
you wanna kill me ?
fine !

396
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,087
i can't live like this
anymore !

397
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,558
go ahead !
do it !

398
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,667
won't be long now, kyle.

399
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,306
josh, i need more help.

400
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,908
the answer's right in front of
you, but you can't see it.

401
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,210
how do you mean ?

402
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,812
tell me, the toilet paper,
was it quilted ?

403
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,113
yes.

404
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:08,981
single sheet ?

405
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,150
no, two-ply.

406
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,885
what ?  what does that
tell you ?

407
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,921
why does one toilet paper
a house, officer ?

408
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,090
to get revenge.

409
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,259
no, that is
incidental.

410
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,994
your toilet-paperers
wanted to transform

411
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,295
the art teacher's house,

412
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,030
thus transforming her
entire occupation.

413
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,332
what do you mean ?

414
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,633
your uncle who hit you
with a belt--

415
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,934
was he a large man ?

416
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,236
i don't have time
for this, kid.

417
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,971
did he stink like beer when
he came home from work,

418
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,573
( southern accent )
all tired from playin'
down at the pool house ?

419
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:35,875
alright, alright !

420
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,176
my dad dressed me up like a
little girl on poker nights

421
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,778
and made me sit on
all my uncles laps !

422
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,513
( sobs )

423
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,116
whoa.

424
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,285
ah, oh--
thank you.

425
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,586
your toilet-paperers
are most likely students

426
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,888
in the art teachers class,

427
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,623
students who aren't
very good at art.

428
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,659
of course !
one of her students !

429
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,960
fly along now,
officer barbrady,

430
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,828
you've got some
arrests to make.

431
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,430
fly fly fly...
fly fly fly.

432
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,334
josh, were you doing
the silly voice

433
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,069
for the policeman again ?

434
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,371
( normal voice )
no, sir.

435
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,046
cartman, what are you
doing ?

436
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,347
i'm getting rid of
our problem !

437
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,649
kyle will be dead
in a matter of hours.

438
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,685
you don't have to kill
kyle, dude,

439
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,854
the police made an arrest,
and the person confessed !

440
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,589
they did ?
they did ?

441
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,890
they say they've got
the guy that did it

442
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,191
down at the
police station !

443
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,493
who confessed ?

444
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,360
that doesn't
make any sense !

445
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:29,662
but can i still
kill kyle ?

446
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,802
hello boys,
how are you ?

447
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,103
we heard that you
have the person

448
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,272
who t.p.'d the art teacher's
house-- is that true ?

449
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,573
it sure is !

450
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,176
uh, could we see them--
him, her ?

451
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,345
right over here.

452
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,514
yeah, we interrogated the
suspect for over 40 hours,

453
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,249
then he finally cracked.

454
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,984
hey fellas !

455
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,285
butters ?

456
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,586
yup, i'm in jail.

457
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,755
you confessed ?

458
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,924
uh-huh, they said i t.p.'d
the art teacher's house.

459
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,225
i don't seem to remember it,

460
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,961
but they're pretty sure
it was me.

461
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,129
i just can't get my behavior
under control !

462
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,732
his parents are on
their way down now.

463
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,335
yeah and boy are they
gonna let me have it !

464
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,070
just wait 'til my father
gets here !

465
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,238
you guys, we can't
let him do this.

466
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,106
what are you
talking about ?

467
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,407
this is a gift
from god !

468
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,709
an early easter present
all wrapped up

469
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,444
with a pretty ribbon from
jesus christ himself !

470
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,046
i'm just a little asshole
is what i am.

471
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,348
when god made me,

472
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,649
he must a not been payin'
very close attention

473
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,818
'cause i turned out wrong,
just plain wrong !

474
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,987
officer barbrady, butters
didn't t.p. that house.

475
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,288
why do you say that ?

476
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,023
because it was--
whiffle ball anyone ?

477
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,625
anyone care for a nice game
of whiffle ball ?

478
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,361
y'know, it's not my parents
i'm worried about,

479
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,662
it's my girlfriend, carrie.

480
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:37,963
she lives in michigan,

481
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,698
but when she finds out
about this,

482
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,433
woo smokies, is she
gonna be sore !

483
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,168
she might even
break up with me.

484
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,470
and it would serve me
right, too !

485
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,205
alright boys,
visiting time is over.

486
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,374
thanks for stopping by.

487
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,579
you see guys, it all
worked itself out !

488
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,880
ta dao !
ta dao !

489
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,748
how do like me now ?

490
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,483
feel a little
silly now, kyle ?

491
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,218
ta dao !
how you like me now !

492
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,519
i still feel bad,
cartman !

493
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,820
what ?

494
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,122
how-- how can you
feel bad ?

495
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,290
somebody else is gonna
pay for our crime !

496
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,459
yeah, that makes it
even worse.

497
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,363
bu-- eh--

498
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,664
kyle, you don't
seem to understand.

499
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,400
we're not gonna get
punished for this, ever !

500
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,568
i know.

501
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,039
so-- so how can you
feel bad ?

502
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,906
he feels guilty for doing it

503
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,942
and for letting someone
else pay for it.

504
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,244
but he's not gonna
get in trouble.

505
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,979
it doesn't matter if you
get in trouble or not,

506
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,280
you can still feel bad.

507
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,015
i think you're right, kyle,
maybe we should confess.

508
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,316
yeah, maybe so.

509
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,485
wha-- dah---
you guys--

510
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,220
there's nothing
to feel bad about,

511
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,522
we're off scot-free !

512
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,257
we feel bad for
otherpeople.

513
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,293
for oth--

514
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:46,065
ahh, ow.

515
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,101
is it that you think you might
get in trouble later ?

516
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,836
tomorrow in school, we'll all
tell the art teacher it was us

517
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,137
and let her
decide what to do.

518
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,872
and cartman, if you have any
thread of a conscience at all,

519
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,607
you'll do the same.

520
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,776
eh-- eh, eh--

521
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,379
freakin' weirdos, man.

522
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,981
well, well, well, i had to
see it to believe it !

523
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,283
hi, dad.

524
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,018
don't you "hi dad" me !

525
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,922
look at you, standing behind
prison bars, again !

526
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,223
yeah.

527
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,958
what fibs have you been telling
this policeman, butters ?

528
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,127

toilet paper that house !

529
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,428

530
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,163

all night, officer barbrady.

531
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,465
butters, what have we
told you about

532
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,633
confessing to crimes
you didn't commit ?

533
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,501
we have had it, mister !

534
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,236
well, he kept
accusing me for hours

535
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,405
and then he shot me up
with sodium pentathol.

536
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,706
and that's your excuse ?

537
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,441
looks like i made
a mistake.

538
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,176
i guess i better
let you out now.

539
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,213
just wait til we get you home,
you little fibber !

540
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,948
officer, can i stay
in jail, please ?

541
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,984

542
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,719

543
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,888
it's over this way,

544
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,563
so how are things, guys ?

545
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:52,865
cartman, we're confessing
tomorrow at school,

546
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,166
and that's final.

547
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,467
i'm afraid i can't
let that happen.

548
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,768
you can't kill all three
of us, cartman.

549
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,937
can't i ?

550
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,179
excuse me, everyone !

551
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,914
i have someone with me
who can tell us all

552
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,950
who toilet-papered
the art teacher's house.

553
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,420
josh insisted he be able
to tell you the names

554
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,023
of the toilet-paperers
in person.

555
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,758
uh, that's nice,
officer barbrady,

556
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,059
but we actually
don't need to know--

557
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,361
hold it !

558
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,096
principal victoria, mr.mackey,
mrs. streibel.

559
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,265
we have something
we need to tell you.

560
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,867
alright, will you people stop
barging into my office please ?

561
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,602
what's the matter,
principal victoria,

562
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,470
was your mother abusive ?

563
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,771
did she spank your thighs
with cold cuts

564
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,506
and stick umbrellas
up your ass ?

565
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,807
get him out of here !

566
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,410
uh, policeman brown, will you
take josh outside, please ?

567
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,145
ooh, policeman brown,

568
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,314
never quite made officer,
why is that, policeman brown ?

569
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,615
we have to confess that
we were the ones--

570
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,917
it's too late, boys, m'kay.

571
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,085
we already know
everything.

572
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,254
you do ?  how ?

573
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:52,291
hi guys.

574
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,592
cartman ?!

575
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,761
i told them everything,
you guys, it's over.

576
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,930
luckily for us, one of you
had enough of a conscience

577
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,231
to come forward.

578
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,532
my consciousness just
caught up with me.

579
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,833
that's not fair !

580
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,569
you all get two weeks
of detention,

581
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,171
except for eric, who gets
one week for being brave.

582
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,472
but he's lying !

583
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,774
he's doesn't have
a conscience !

584
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,943
well, i guess my
work here is done.

585
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,413
after all this, i'm gonna
need a long vacation.

586
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,148
this was supposed
to be my story !

587
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,883
my coming to terms with
a guilty conscience !

588
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,184
this isn't fair !

589
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,353
okay, josh, time to go
back to the--

590
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,522
oh, no !

591
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,257
he was too fast
for me.

592
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,992
he ran out the door.

593
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,727
couldn't you have
gone after him ?

594
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,197
well, i'm covered in
toilet paper, i'd look silly.

595
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,932
( bell rings )

596
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,535
welcome to detention.

597
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,270
you will be here
until 5:00

598
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,872
so make good study use
of your time, m'kay.

599
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,608
oof, two weeks of this.

600
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,776
yeah, but i have to say
i feel a lot better now.

601
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,078
i know what
you mean, kyle.

602
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,379
i realize now
that even though

603
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,114
you might not get caught
doing something bad

604
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,849
you can still
get caught later.

605
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,150
oh, jesus.

606
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,885
i didn't feel bad before,
but now i feel just terrible.

607
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,054
you just feel bad for yourself
that you're in detention !

608
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,356
right.

609
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,657
i guess
i learned that--

610
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,392
oh, stop it, cartman,
you didn't learn anything !

611
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,995
not a god damn thing !

612
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,163
hmm.

613
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,332
( phone rings )

614
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,501
police station !

615
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,236
hello,
officer barbrady.

616
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,104
josh ?

617
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,405
josh, where are you ?

618
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,706
i'm afraid that
giving away my location

619
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,441
might be harmful
to my freedom, officer.

620
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,743
i just wanted to thank you

621
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,478
for helping me get out of
that dingy cell.

622
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,213
josh, you have to go back
to juvenile hall.

623
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,382
you only have
a three-week sentence !

624
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,683
sorry, officer, gotta run.

625
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,550
there's something
i've been meaning to do

626
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,021
for quite some time, ciao.
