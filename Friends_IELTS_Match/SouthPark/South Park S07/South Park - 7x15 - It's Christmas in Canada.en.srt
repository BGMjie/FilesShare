00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,550
Our little family
Is so loving and perfect

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,153
And nothing will ever
Tear us apart !

22
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,454
( doorbell rings )

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,755
I'll get it !

24
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,659
Gerald broflovski ?

25
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,960
Yes.

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,129
My name is harry gintz
And this is my wife, elise.

27
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,431
We're from canada.

28
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,599
Yes, i can tell.

29
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,768
My wife and i had a child
A few years back,

30
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,503
And we weren't ready
To have a child

31
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,238
So we put him up
For adoption.

32
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,540
We were told that you
Might be the--

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,841
Peter !

34
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,576
Oh god, harry,
It's our son !

35
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,745
Peter, it's mommy !

36
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,480
Gerald, what the hell
Is going on ?!

37
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,215
I'm not sure.

38
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,384
It was a tough time
For us.

39
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,553
It was a tough time
For all of canada.

40
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,721
The whole country was
Devastated by the cola wars.

41
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,324
It just seemed we couldn't
Take care of a baby.

42
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,625
So we put him up
For adoption.

43
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,360
But as the years
Passed, i,

44
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,096
I just felt an
Emptiness in my heart.

45
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,264
Oh, it's so good
To see him !

46
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,301
Well, we... Wish you all
The best, mr. And mrs. Gintz.

47
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,903
But, to be honest, i think
It would be best for ike

48
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,072
If you didn't
Come around again.

49
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,807
I don't think
You understand.

50
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,542
We didn't come
To visit peter--

51
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,277
We came to
Take him back.

52
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,579
What ?

53
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,747
We want to take
Peter home, to canada.

54
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,049
Are you crazy ?!

55
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,350
Look, you gave ike up.

56
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,085
You can't just
Change your mind !

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,820
Changing your mind
Is a canadian custom

58
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,555
That we hold quite dear.

59
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,290
And besides, the new
Canadian prime minister

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,025
Has issued a decree
That all adopted canadians

61
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,760
Must be returned home.

62
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,929
The new canadian
Prime minister ?!

63
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,098
Look, ike is our son now !

64
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,399
He doesn't belong here.

65
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,568
He belongs in canada
With his own kind.

66
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,870
I think you better leave.

67
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,605
Please, don't make this
Any harder for peter.

68
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,906
Harder for peter ?!

69
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,641
You two just
Blow in here

70
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,376
And say you're gonna
Haul him back to canada

71
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,111
And we're being hard
On peter ?!

72
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,412
We're prepared
To go to court.

73
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,714
But we had hoped it
Wouldn't come to that.

74
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,184
You bet your ass
It'll come to that !

75
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,786
I'm sorry to say
That my hands are tied.

76
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,522
The new prime minister
Of canada

77
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,690
Has authority this court
Cannot override.

78
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,293
By canadian law, i must
Award custody of the child

79
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,028
To his birth parents.

80
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,329
Yes !
Yes !

81
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,631
No !

82
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,799
Ike's not my little
Brother anymore ?

83
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,101
Gerald, do something !

84
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,703
There's nothing
I can do.

85
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,872
( crying )

86
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,174
Good-bye, ike.

87
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,776
You... Be a good
Boy, huh ?

88
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,812
You... Remember all the
Things we taught you.

89
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,716
Ike...

90
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,451
You'll always be my
Little brother, okay ?

91
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,187
Come on, peter,
We should get going.

92
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,922
No !

93
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,090
Peter, you must come
With mommy and daddy.

94
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,825
No, no, no,
No, no !

95
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,994
I have some
Chocolate.

96
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,031
Chocolate !

97
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,766
We're going to take
Good care of him.

98
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,501
You better.

99
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,646
Dad ?

100
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,815
Can't we talk to this new
Canadian prime minister ?

101
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,549
If he knew the situation
He might--

102
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,153
Oh kyle, appealing to the
Prime minister of canada

103
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,189
Would take time and
Money we don't have.

104
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,822
Dude, look at that.

105
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,858
"sprinkle time make-your-own
Marshmallow factory".

106
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,461
I'm definitely asking
For that for christmas.

107
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,196
Dude, i'm gonna tell
My parents to get me

108
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,365
That john elway doll with
The karate chop action.

109
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:00,666
Guys.

110
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,968
Guys, i need
Your help.

111
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,269
Sure, dude !

112
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,570
It's been a week
Since ike's been gone.

113
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,305
And every day
My parents seem worse.

114
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:07,607
I have to try to
Go to canada

115
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,342
And speak with the new
Canadian prime minister.

116
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:10,643
But i can't
Do it alone.

117
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:11,944
We can't go to
Canada, dumbass !

118
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:13,679
It's christmas !

119
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,547
Yeah dude, what if we
Miss out on some

120
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,282
Great christmas
Adventure ?

121
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:17,583
Please, you guys,
You don't understand.

122
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:19,318
My family is devastated.

123
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:20,620
My mom just walks around
The house like a zombie,

124
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,788
And my dad
Can't stop crying !

125
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,090
Well, i didn't want to
Say anything, kyle,

126
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,825
But i think maybe this is
What your family gets

127
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:27,560
For being jewish
At christmastime.

128
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,861
Dude, cartman.

129
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:30,162
I'm just saying
Maybe jesus is having

130
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:31,897
A little revenge,
That's all.

131
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,633
I found the number of a really
Cheap airline to canada.

132
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:34,934
If we go as soon
As possible--

133
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,103
Dude, we just can't
Up and go to canada.

134
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,838
Look, they're about to
Light the christmas tree,

135
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:41,440
Maybe you can get your brother
Back some other way.

136
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:46,646
Kyle, i just
Want you to know,

137
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,381
If it were any other
Time of the year

138
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:50,549
I still
Wouldn't help you.

139
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:56,188
( crowd )
Three !  Two !  One !

140
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,791
Yeah !
Hooray !

141
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,526
As we celebrate
This glorious time

142
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,695
We can't forget those families
Who are suffering.

143
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,864
As many of you know,
The broflovski family

144
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:07,033
Has recently had their child
Torn away from them.

145
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,201
As a community,
We must do all we can

146
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,503
To ease their pain.

147
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,407
Are there any suggestions
How we might help ?

148
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:18,744
How about, we get rid of
All the mexicans !

149
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:21,347
Mr. Garrison,
Every christmas you suggest

150
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:22,648
We get rid of
All the mexicans

151
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:24,817
And every christmas
We tell you: no.

152
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:26,118
Rats !

153
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,287
The broflovskis need money
To appeal their case

154
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,456
To the new canadian
Prime minister.

155
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,625
What if this christmas,
Instead of buying presents,

156
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,661
We all use that money to
Give to the broflovskis ?

157
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,396
Ha !
Yeah, right !

158
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:38,698
Like our parents
Aren't gonna buy us

159
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:39,999
Presents for
Christmas !

160
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,734
That's a great
Idea, chef !

161
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:43,035
What ?

162
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:44,337
Yeah, who needs
More stuff anyway ?

163
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:45,638
This christmas
We can do something

164
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:46,939
That really matters !

165
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:48,240
Dad, don't get
Carried away.

166
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,542
Then it's settled !

167
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,277
This year we'll give
All our christmas money

168
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:53,446
To the broflovskis in hopes
That they may someday

169
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,614
Have their child
Returned to them !

170
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:56,916
( cheering )

171
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,386
No... No, this can't
Be happening !

172
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,988
( sobbing )

173
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,326
You ( bleeping ) asshole !!

174
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,627
This is all
Your fault !!

175
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:09,929
What ?

176
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:11,230
Everyone's gonna
Be charitable

177
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,531
And give money
To your family

178
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,833
Instead of buying

181
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:18,604
Whoa, whoa,
Cartman.

182
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,339
It wasn't enough for
You people to kill jesus,

183
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,508
Now you have to kill
Christmas too, huh ?!

184
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,376
Cartman, calm down !

185
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:24,677
Is that true ?

186
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:26,846
It's true, dude--
Christmas is ruined.

187
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,581
This is it, kyle,
You and me,

Right now.

189

I'm sorry, you guys.

190
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:32,918
But there is something
We can do.

191
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,220
We can go to canada

192
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,955
And see the prime
Minister like i said.

193
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:37,256
If we can change his mind
Before christmas,

194
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,425
Then your parents won't have
To give my family money.

195
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,160
You really think
If we go to canada

196
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,461
We might still get
Christmas presents ?

197
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:43,763
It's worth a shot.

198
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:45,931
Come on, you guys,
We can do this.

199
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,233
All right, but we
Better not miss out

00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,363
Please, sir !

531
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:27,532
I came because i don't
Think ike belongs here.

532
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:29,267
Family isn't about whose blood
You have in you.

533
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,002
Family is about the people
Who cared about you

534
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,737
And took care of you.

535
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,906
We're not the same blood,
But i love my little brother.

536
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,509
We've taken care of him
Because he needed us to.

537
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:40,979
And that makes us more
Family than anything.

538
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:44,883
That was a great
Speech, guy.

539
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,052
But the answer is no !

540
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:50,956
All of my new laws will stay
In effect forever !

541
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:53,125
Ha ha !
You lose, americans !

542
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,727
Then i suppose us mounties
Will never get our horses.

543
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,896
And we won't
Get our wine.

544
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,631
And we can't
Perform sodomy, eh.

545
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:01,366
But why are you making
Such strange laws ?

546
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:03,101
I said go !

547
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,740
Oh my god !
They killed kenny !

548
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,909
You... Bastards.

549
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:12,644
What, what the hell
Is wrong with you ?!

550
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:15,247
What kind of prime minister
Bases his decisions on hatred ?

551
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:18,283
And takes away mounties' horses
And french people's wine ?

552
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,452
What the hell kind of prime
Minister are you anyway ?!

553
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,488
I am the prime minister
Of canada !

554
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:25,657
I can do whatever i...

555
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,260
Uh-oh !

556
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,428
Uh, don't mind that guy
Hiding in the spider hole,

557
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:31,730
He's just my friend !

558
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,031
What the hell !

559
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:34,332
Hey, that looks like
Saddam hussein !

560
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:35,634
Saddam hussein ?

561
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,935
Nooo,
Relax, buddy !

562
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:38,236
I'm not him !

563
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:39,538
Zat explains
Everything !

564
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,140
Ze new prime minister was
Saddam hussein once again

565
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,875
Trying to take over
Our beloved canada

566
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,743
Like he did before !

567
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:46,044
Saddam hussein ?

568
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:47,345
He was fooling us ?

569
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:48,647
Get him !

570
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:50,815
Uh, don't shoot !
I want to negotiate !

571
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,418
Hey, relax !

572
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:54,010
Wait a minute !

573
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:56,235
This means all the prime
Minister's new laws

574
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,543
Are null and void !

575
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:58,844
We can have
Our horses back !

576
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:00,579
And we can
Drink our wine !

577
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,748
And i can sodomize
Me boys again !

578
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:05,351
Young man, you must
Really care for peter

579
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:06,652
To have come
All this way.

580
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,821
Perhaps we were wrong to
Try and take peter back.

581
00:20:09,254 --> 00:20:11,857
He doesn't belong here,
He belongs with his family.

582
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:15,327
Peter, would you like to go
Back to your home in colorado ?

583
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:22,701
( electronic beeping )

584
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,003
What is that ?

585
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:25,304
It's christmas.

586
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,039
We officially
Missed it.

587
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:30,509
It's christmas day,
And i'm in canada.

588
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:32,244
Yeah, but,
I got my brother back.

Your brother back,

590
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:35,714

Any presents !

Tell you, kyle ?
