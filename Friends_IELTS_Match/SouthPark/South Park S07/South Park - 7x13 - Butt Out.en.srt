00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,815
removed from movies and art,

184
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,418
i force smokers
out of bars and parks--

185
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,153
but still i get letters
from parents

186
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,322
saying their kids
are doing it !

187
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,659
apparently, people
still don't understand

188
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,828
how bad smoking is
for them !

189
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,431
don't they know how dangerous
it is to their health ?!

190
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,033
don't they know the hazard
of secondhand smoke ?!

191
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,335
according to
the letter, sir,

192
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,371
the town has a tobacco
company quite near them.

193
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,672
yeah, that must be it !

194
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,841
the tobacco companies with
their millions of dollars

195
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,010
and their slick desks
and fancy buildings !

196
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,046
they're the ones making
children want to smoke.

197
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,517
they're the ones hurting
our nation's health !

198
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,685
i will not stand by and
see the children of america

199
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,288
corrupted by
those bastards !

200
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,023
this is war !

201
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,096
you guys, maybe we should
come clean right now

202
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,831
and tell everyone that it
wasn't the tobacco companies

203
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,132
that made us
want to smoke.

204
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,434
what ?

205
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,735
why ?
it's perfect !

206
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,602
if everyone's blaming
the tobacco companies,

207
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:17,904
then nobody's
blaming us !

208
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,205
yeah, what's the problem ?

209
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,506
it's just that--

210
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,808
this seems like another
one of those times

211
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,109
when things are gonna get
way out of hand, you know ?

212
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,410
it's been happening
a lot lately.

213
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,013
how about this time we just
put a stop to it right now ?

214
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,314
dumbass,
you don't want to be

215
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,615
grounded for
three weeks, do you ?

216
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,483
yeah, don't worry, dude,

217
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,784
things aren't gonna
get out of hand.

218
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,519
here he comes !

219
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,966
dammit.

220
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,267
( straining )

221
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,870
butter !
butter !

222
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,605
what'd he say ?

223
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,340
butter !

224
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,883
( crowd cheering )

225
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,823
( panting )

226
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,595
hello, south park !

227
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,667
it is so nice to see
an entire town come together

228
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,270
to fight for good health !

229
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,306
and i'm gonna
help you !

230
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,475
these poor,
innocent children

231
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,644
have been seduced into
smoking tobacco.

232
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,114
so i say, we fight fire
with fire !

233
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,849
we're gonna use
these children

234
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,452
to bring the tobacco
company down !

235
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,223
oh, no.

236
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,697
all right, kids, here's
what we're gonna do.

237
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,866
we're gonna sneak you
into the tobacco company

238
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,336
by saying you kids want
a tour for a school paper.

239
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,373
once you're inside,
i'm gonna take photos

240
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,409
and then we'll publish them,
saying the tobacco company

241
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,445
invited you over to
seduce you into smoking !

242
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,747
got it ?!

243
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,048
got it !

244
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,651
but-- isn't that
kind of lying ?

245
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,253
we're just leveling out
the playing field.

246
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,555
the tobacco companies
lie to you

247
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,290
about the dangers
of smoking.

248
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,025
if we're gonna
take them down

249
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,760
we've gotta lie
right back !

250
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,929
( sniffing )

251
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,435
oh my god !

252
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,038
( coughs )

253
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,206
( coughs louder )

254
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,110
excuse me !

255
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,845
yes ?

256
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,882
would you mind putting
that death stick out ?!

257
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,051
but, uh, this is a bar.

258
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,786
isn't smoking illegal
in bars here ?

259
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,521
not in colorado.

260
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,822
oh my god !

261
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,425
what kind of backward,
hick state is this ?!

262
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,594
look, man, i work 14 hours
a day at the saw mill.

263
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,196
i just got off work
and i need to relax.

264
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,497
well, when i relax,

265
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,232
i just go to my
vacation house in hawaii !

266
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,269
i ain't got a
vacation house in hawaii.

267
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,438
your vacation house
in mexico then,

268
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,739
whatever it is !

269
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,209
look, you are putting my life
and these boys' lives in danger

270
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,944
by smoking that in here.

271
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,679
and i am not gonna
tolerate it !

272
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,282
i will end smoking
in bars in colorado !

273
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,318
there will be
no more smoking !

274
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,620
isn't he awesome,
you guys ?

275
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:21,921
what ?!

276
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,090
dude, he just goes around
imposing his will on people.

277
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,825
he's my idol.

278
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,596
all right, boys,
just do what i tell you,

279
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,331
and we'll be able to sue
this tobacco company

280
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,934
for $2 billion !

281
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,669
as soon as we get into
the main facility

282
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,404
i'll snap the photo
of you kids

283
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,705
and we can all
run out.

284
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,007
think you can
handle it ?

285
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,308
handle it ?

286
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,910
for $2 billion i'd handle
my grandpa's balls, sir.

287
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,212
all right, great.

288
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,947
okay, now watch
yourselves, kids.

289
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,682
these tobacco company people
will do anything

290
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,284
to get you hooked
on smoking.

291
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,755
they are liars
and they are frauds !

292
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,490
can i help you ?

293
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,659
yes, my name is
rita poon,

294
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,695
i called about my boys
wanting a tour.

295
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,430
ah yes, mrs. poon.

296
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,297
my name's
kevin harris

297
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,466
and i'm the vice president
of big tobacco.

298
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,635
hello, mr. harris.

299
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,936
well, come on in !

300
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,105
how about a little
history first ?

301
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,142
native americans were the first
to cultivate the tobacco plant.

302
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,443
they smoked it in pipes

303
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,046
for medicinal and
ceremonial purposes.

304
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,214
not if i were around
they wouldn't have !

305
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,082
excuse me ?

306
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,817
oh, nothing !
please continue !

307
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,552
the first successful
commercial crop of tobacco

308
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,155
was cultivated
in virginia in 1612.

309
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,456
within seven years
it was one of the country's

310
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,191
largest exports !

311
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,926
so, tobacco helped
to build america.

312
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,227
that's right.

313
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,529
over the next few centuries,

314
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,264
the tobacco business
was so great

315
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,565
that many slaves were
brought from africa

316
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,300
to help work the fields.

317
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,035
which means if it
weren't for tobacco

318
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,638
many of our black friends
wouldn't be here today.

319
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,240
and so for centuries, tobacco
production flourished.

320
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,409
nobody was even aware
of any dangers back then,

321
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,879
until, in 1965, when
congress passed an act

322
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,614
forcing all tobacco companies

323
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,783
to put the surgeon general's
warning on their packages.

324
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,386
so now, everyone knows
the dangers of smoking.

325
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,121
and some people
still choose to do it,

326
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,157
and we believe that's what being
an american is all about.

327
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,326
that sounds perfectly
reasonable.

328
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,061

00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,957
( screaming )

359
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,126
oh my god !

360
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,295
oh boy, that was
great, kids !

361
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,596
( kyle )
those people at
the tobacco company

362
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,898
all seem really nice.

363
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,199
yeah, you see that ?

364
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,934
they got into
your head !

365
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,103
now you kids can meet some
good decent people,

366
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,573
the folks who work
to get smoking banned !

367
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,308
( growling )

368
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,646
( hissing )

369
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,248
this is how we get
rid of smokers !

370
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,718
we go state to state and do
things like use bogus studies

371
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,887
and make expensive
commercials

372
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,056
to get the public
on our side

373
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,092
and force cigarette
smokers to stop !

374
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,695
wow, it's like, it's like
smoking brings a lot of people

375
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,996
just a little bit of joy

376
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,731
and you get to take that
away from them.

377
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,466
you are so awesome.

378
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,768
here you go, bob.

379
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,503
this is
mr. valkri,

380
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,672
he does all
ourphotoshopwork.

381
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,841
now all we have to do
is photoshop cigarettes

382
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,009
into your hands,
and bingo !

383
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,612
when this hits the papers the
tobacco company is screwed !

384
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:07,913
ha ha ha ha !

385
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,648
ha ha ha ha !

386
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,817
but dude--
you're making stuff up.

387
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,986
you kids need to understand
something, okay ?

388
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,721
sometimes lying is okay,

389
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:20,059
like when you know what's good
for people more than they do.

390
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,661
oh my god, that is exactly
what i've always said.

391
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,963
i love this guy !

392
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,698
mr. reiner, your bill
to have smoking

393
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,867
outlawed in bars here
didn't pass.

394
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,168
what ?!

395
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,469
god dammit, what
the hell is wrong

396
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,204
with people
in this state ?!

397
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,939
apparently, several people
here still believe

398
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,674
there's no proof secondhand
smoke can kill you.

399
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,843
they want proof ?!

400
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,012
all right,
we'll give them proof !

401
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,048
boys, i need one of you to act
in a commercial for us !

402
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,783
we'll shoot it tomorrow !

403
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,085
wow, a commercial ?!

404
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,820
you boys decide
which one of you

405
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,555
would be best
for the part.

406
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,724
all right, people, we gotta
get moving on the bill

407
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,459
to ban smoking
in parks here !

408
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,760
let's go !

409
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,495
god, he's just the best !

410
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,664
mr. reiner !
can i get you a muffin ?

411
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,965
or a cold drink perhaps ?

412
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,002
you guys, i think we should
bail out of this right now.

413
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,170
huh ?
i justknowwhere
this is heading-

414
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,472
it's gonna end up
with the whole town

415
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,773
taking this too far

416
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,508
and us having to talk
about "what we learned"

417
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,376
to change everyone's mind,

418
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,111
and i say we just
stop right now

419
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,412
and go play
cards or something.

420
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,713
yup, i totally agree.

421
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,015
yeah, maybe
you're right.

422
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,183
so, gentlemen, looks
like only one of us

423
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,352
gets to be in
the commercial, huh ?

424
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,220
who will it be... ?

425
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:22,955
gentlemen,
the game is on !

426
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:23,822
go ahead.

427
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,557
we don't want to be in
their stupid commercial.

428
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,425
huh ?

429
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,726
oh, i get it, kyle.

430
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,461
that's your serbian jew
double bluff--

431
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,196
make me think you don't care
about being in the commercial

432
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,498
so that maybe
i won't either.

433
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,233
oops, didn't work,
did it, kyle ?

434
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,968
no, we really want nothing more
to do with these people.

435
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,269
sure you don't, kyle.

436
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,137
oh, and neither do i.

437
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,438
i know what you're
gonna say next.

438
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,739
you're gonna say,
"how about none of us

439
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,041
show up tomorrow
to do it ?"

440
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,776
and then i'm supposed to
agree, so that tomorrow

441
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,077
you can waltz in
all by yourself

442
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:45,945
and do the commercial.

443
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,246
that's serbian jew
double bluff,

444
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,981
and it ain't
gonna work on me.

445
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,716
heh heh heh.

446
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,017
only one of us can be in
the commercial, gentlemen.

447
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,620
the game-- is on.

448
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,634
sorry, kyle, but i'm afraid
only one of us will be

449
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,803
showing up to do the
commercial tomorrow, ha ha ha !

450
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,538
thought you had me

451
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,273
with your serbian jew
double bluff, didn't you ?

452
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,008
well, let's see you try to
open this door now !

453
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,743
( laughing )

454
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,779
what are you doing ?

455
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,514
oh.

456
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,249
hello, kyle.

457
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,720
oh man, wait--
this isn't my house.

458
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,888
cartman, you go ahead and
do the commercial tomorrow.

459
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,623
but i'm warning you:
those anti-smoking people

460
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,359
are liars
and they're bullies

461
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,094
who will stop at nothing
to get what they want,

462
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,829
and that means
they're dangerous.

463
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,769
ha ha ha ha !

464
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,070
nice try, kyle !

465
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,372
let's see you try to get
through this door now !

466
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,673
ha ha ha ha !

467
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,444
okay, eric, this is
gonna be real simple.

468
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,746
all you gotta do is just
read the words

469
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,914
on the teleprompter, here.

470
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,216
( laughing )
okay !

471
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,385
let's see how the tobacco
companies deal with this !

472
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,120
all right,
roll camera !

473
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,421
roll the teleprompter.

474
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,722
and whenever
you're ready, eric.

475
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,457
( giggling )
okay, okay.

476
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,192
( takes a deep breath )

477
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,229
you know, some people say
there's no proof

478
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,398
that secondhand smoke kills.

479
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,699
the tobacco companies say
there's no proof

480
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,868
that secondhand smoke
kills.

481
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,470
i've just been diagnosed
with terminal lung cancer.

482
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,639
i guess...
i'm the proof.

483
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,374
the next time
you want to believe

484
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,109
that secondhand smoke
doesn't kill,

485
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,411
think about me.

486
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,013
because by the time
you see this commercial

487
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,616
i'll be dead.

488
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,351
dead ?

489
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,218
and cut !

490
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:34,520
great, we got it !

491
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,688
wrap up, people,
that was fantastic !

492
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,291
what-- what does that mean,
i'll be dead ?

493
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,894
hey, what was that
dead part ?

494
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,629
that was very good,
eric.

495
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,231
here, eat this cupcake.

496
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,268
uh... no thanks,
i'm not hungry.

497
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,569
but you are.

498
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,304
just eat this
one cupcake.

499
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,907
it has sprinkles.

500
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,509
i'm not eating
the cupcake.

501
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,112
eric, do you know what
a hero is ?

502
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,281
a hero is somebody
who sacrifices himself

503
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,016
for the good of others.

504
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,751
you can be
a hero, eric.

505
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,655
all you have to do
is eat the cupcake.

506
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,559
jesus christ !

507
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,294
hey !

508
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,029
( panting )

509
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,572
what are you
doing, cartman ?

510
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,873
they're going to
kill me !

511
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,042
who's going to
kill you ?

512
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,211
the anti-smoking people !

513
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,512
they had me say i died
from secondhand smoke

514
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,681
and now they want to sacrifice
me to make it look real !

515
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,982
they'll stop at nothing !

516
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,717
well, get away
from us then !

517
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,452
yeah, dude, don't
get us killed too !

518
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,753
you guys have to
help me !

519
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,055
no, dude, get away !

520
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,356
please you guys, i don't
know what to do !

521
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,091
stop it, cartman,
go die on your own !

522
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,392
if i go, you guys go !

523
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,260
dad !

524
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,561
what ?

525
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,296
the anti-smoking people are
trying to kill cartman

526
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,598
and he won't
stay away from us !

527
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,333
don't be ridiculous, boys.

528
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,935
the anti-smoking people are
kind, caring and intelligent.

529
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,237
your heads have just
been corrupted

530
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,273
by the lies of the
big tobacco companies.

531
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,574
hey, maybe that's it,
you guys.

532
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,309
maybe the tobacco company
can help us !

533
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,177
help you, fatass !

534
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,478
we weren't in the
commercial, remember ?

535
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,647
yeah, go to the
tobacco company yourself.

536
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,948
well, that's fine !

537
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,117
i thought you guys were my
friends but i guess i was wrong.

538
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,852
yeah, dude, you were
totally wrong.

539
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,720
uh-huh.

540
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,889
you guys, i am seriously
getting pissed off now !

541
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,190
now come on, we're going to
the tobacco company !

542
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,491
oh, all right !

543
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,792
no !

544
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,528
what we really should do is
go to our parents right now

545
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,263
and take responsibility
for smoking ourselves.

546
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,564
even if it means
getting grounded.

547
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,431
why ?

548
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,167
because, if we go to
the tobacco company

549
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,468
i know exactly
what'll happen !

550
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,769
they'll take us in,

551
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,637
and then rob reiner
will show up

552
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,372
with all the townspeople
holding torches or something

553
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,673
and there'll be
a big showdown

554
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,974
until we talk about
what we learned

555
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,276
and change
everyone's minds.

556
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,011
this is all following
a formula !

557
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,746
so it's either
deal with all that

558
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,216
or be grounded
for three weeks.

559
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,818
( angry shouting )

560
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:49,855
god dammit.

561
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,590
give us the child !

562
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,891
we will not !

563
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,193
there, you see that ?

564
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,361
the tobacco company
won't give us the kid !

565
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,663
and do you know why ?

566
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,265
because they know that
if they give us that kid

567
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,000
then we'll kill him !

568
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,735
and when our commercial
goes on the air

569
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,904
it will lose them
business !

570
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,507
yeah !
that's right !

571
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,543
( mr. mackey )
wait a minute-- what ?

572
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,712
yeah, when we kill the kid,
people are gonna think

573
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,447
it's because of
secondhand smoke,

574
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,050
and then these bastards
aren't gonna make money,

575
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,351
and they know it !

576
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,520
what the hell is
wrong with you ?

577
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,821
that's not right.

578
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,424
oh god dammit, do i have to
explain this again ?

579
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,026
smoking is bad, people !

580
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,496
so if we have to be a little
extreme to stop it, it's okay !

581
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,798
no, it isn't,
you fat turd !

582
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,400
because i've learned
something today.

583
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,569
you just hate--
see ?  i knew it.

584
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:38,437
yup.

585
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,738
you just hate smoking

586
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,039
so you use all your
money and power

587
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,341
to force others
to think like you,

588
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,509
and that's called fascism,
you tubby asshole !

589
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,546
god dammit, there will
be no more smoking !

590
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,281
it wasn't the tobacco company's
fault that we smoked.

591
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,582
it was our fault, us.

592
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,317
we should all take
personal responsibility

593
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,354
instead of letting fat fascists
like him tell us what to do !

594
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,956
you're right, boys,
m'kay !

595
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,691
yeah, let smokers smoke !

596
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,294
yeah !
that's right !

597
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,161
hey, mr. reiner !

598
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,330
why don't you--
butt out !

599
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,499
( laughter )

600
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,367
i'm warning you !

601
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,535
don't mess with
anti-smoking groups !

602
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,138
i don't idolize you
anymore, asshole !

603
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,042
my goo !

604
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,211
my precious goo !

605
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,416
so kyle, it wasn't
the tobacco company

606
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,717
that made you
want to smoke ?

607
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,019
no.

608
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,754
well then, you are
grounded, mister !

609
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,055

610
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,790
aww, awwww !

611
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,959
well, i guess we
learned our lesson.

612
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,826

didn't dude...

613
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,995
