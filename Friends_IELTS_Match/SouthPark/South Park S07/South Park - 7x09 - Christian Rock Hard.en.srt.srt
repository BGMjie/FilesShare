stan, are you okay ?

20
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,381
yeah, dad, we're just
rehearsing our band.

21
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,984
ohh, i thought a group
of vietnamese people

22
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,285
were having their
intestines

23
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,888
pulled out
through their mouths.

24
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,792
ha ha ha ha haa !
ha ha ha ha haa !

25
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,527
he's right, dude, we have
to define our style

26
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,828
if we're ever going to
make a platinum album.

27
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,563
i mean, i'm a fusion guy,

28
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,298
but kenny's background
is more latin-jazz.

29
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,599
yup, uh-huh.

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,334
yeah, and i'm more hip-hop
and r & b oriented.

31
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,937
i think our band better buy
a whole bunch of music cds

32
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,106
to listen to
for inspiration.

33
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,841
inspiration...

34
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,576
wait a minute,
that's it !

35
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,311
inspiration, you guys.
don't you see ?

36
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,179
see what ?

37
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,215
our band should play
christian rock !

38
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,384
christian rock ?

39
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,119
think about it !

40
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,854
it's the easiest, crappiest
music in the world, right ?

41
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,155
if we just play songs about
how much we love jesus,

42
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,324
all the christians
will buy our crap !

43
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,059
that's a retarded
idea, cartman !

44
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,360
it worked forcreed!

45
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,096
i don't wanna be in
a stupid christian
rock band !

46
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,264
you just start that way, stan,
then you cross over !

47
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,132
it's genius !

48
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,867
just get the hell
out of here, cartman !

49
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,602
you're not serious and you're
a detriment to the band !

50
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,470
oh yeah ?

51
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,337
i will bet you 10 bucks

52
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,072
that if i start
a christian rock band

53
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,807
i can get a platinum album
before you guys do !

54
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,109
you're on, fat boy !

55
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,410
okay, fine !

56
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,579

a platinum album wins.

57
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,446

58
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,747
( huffing )

59
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,651
what a stupid
asshole.

60
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,555
platinum album !

61
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,290

album before kyle !

62
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,459
oh, hi, eric.

63
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,628
butters, get your drum set

64
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,496

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,231

66
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,399

token, get the bass guitar
out of your basement

70
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,773
and meet me over
at my house !

71
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,075
what ?!

72
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,810
we don't have
a bass guitar.

73
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,111
your family's black, token,

74
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:25,979
there's bound to be
a bass guitar

75
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,581
in your basement
somewhere !

76
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,786
boy, you sure
seem driven, eric.

77
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,522
you must really have
some inspiration.

78
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,257
yes, the tears of
kyle broflovski

79
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,992
when he loses his
$10 to me.

80
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,161
hey, there was a bass
guitar in my basement.

81
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,028
i told you, token.

82
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,763
so, what are we doing ?

83
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,498
gentlemen, we are about to
embark on the most amazing,

84
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,667
life-affirming,
financially windfalling

85
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,968
experiences of
our young lives.

86
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,270
wow !

87
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,306
we are going to start...
a christian rock band.

88
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,041
aww...

89
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,342
i'm out.

90
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,644
wait !

91
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,511
walk out
that door, token,

92
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,812
and you'll regret it
the rest of your life !

93
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,114
christians have
a built-in audience

94
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,415
of over 180 million
americans.

95
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,150
if each one of them buys
just one of our albums

96
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,885
at $12.95 that would be--

97
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,355
two billion,
331 million dollars.

98
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,524
still want to leave,
token ?

99
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,127
thank you.

100
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,296
dad, can i borrow
$300 ?

101
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,332
$300 !
what in the world for ?!

102
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,501
our band can't find a
stylistic direction to go in.

103
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,368
we need to go
down to the mall

104
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,103
to buy hundreds of cds
to listen to

105
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,405
so we can define
our sound.

106
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,574
sorry, kyle, we gave you
your allowance already.

107
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,176
can't you see
this is my dream ?!

108
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,477
music is my life !

109
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,779
it wasn't your life
yesterday.

110
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,381
look, pops, i've got
the music inside me.

111
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,116
it's in my soul.

112
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,418
and i know my place
is up on that stage.

113
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,153
i'm gonna make it
to the top.

114
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,888
and i just want
your blessing, pops.

115
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,189
the answer is no, kyle.

116
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,924
aw, come on, dad,
don't be such a jew !

117
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,659
kyle, don't belittle
your own people !

118
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,262
argh !

119
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,129
hey, dude.

120
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,431
it didn't work.

121
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,166
my stupid jew dad won't
lend me money for cds.

122
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,467
no, dude, it's cool.

123
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,768
kenny says you can
download music for free

124
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:56,636
on the internet !

125
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,503
really ?

126
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,371
yeah !

127
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,106
you got a computer ?

128
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,142
see, everyone on the internet
copies music from their cds

129
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,877
and then we can
download them for free

130
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,179
and play 'em
on the computer !

131
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,480
all right, cool !

132
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,348

135
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,685
kenny's right,

00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,987
we should download
somejudas priest,too.

137
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,722
judas priest...

138
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,890
wow !  downloading music

139
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,493
( helicopter whirring,
police siren )

140
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,794

00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,096

i don't know !

152
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,953
all right guys, this is
gonna be so easy.

153
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,254
all we have to do to
make christian songs

154
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,857
is take regular old songs
and add jesus stuff to them !

155
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,327
see, all we have to do is
cross out words like "baby"

156
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,062
and "darlin'" and
replace them with...

157
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,098
jeeesus.

158
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,267
all right, butters,
give me a beat.

159
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,171
( mid-tempo beat )

160
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,472
okay, nice, very nice.

161
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,509

00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,846

have to go through this ?

164
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,015
you're black.
you can play bass.

165
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,750
i'm getting sick of
your stereotypes.

166
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,618

00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,259
shut up !!

180
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,163
you downloaded
a lot of songs.

181
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,200
says here, you even
downloaded judas priest.

182
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,369
that's hard time
you boys are looking at.

183
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,971
you got anything to
say for yourselves ?

184
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,007
we...  we didn't think
it was that big a deal.

185
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,610
not a big deal ?

186
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,382
you think downloading music
for free is not a big deal ?

187
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,285
put your coats on, i'm
gonna show you something.

188
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,888
and i don't think
you're gonna like it.

189
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,491
this is the home
of lars ulrich,

190
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,659
the drummer
for metallica.

191
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,997
look, there's lars now,
sitting by his pool.

192
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,298
what's the matter
with him ?

193
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,467
this month he was hoping
to have a gold-plated

194
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,202
shark tank bar installed
right next to the pool.

195
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,937
but thanks to people

196
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,672
downloading his music
for free

197
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,143
he must now wait a few months
before he can afford it.

198
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,444
( whimpering )

199
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,613
come, there's more.

200
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,649
here's britney spears'
private jet.

201
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:58,384
notice anything ?

202
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,987
britney used to have
agulfstream iv,

203
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,589
now she's had to sell it
and get a gulfstream iii

204
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,927
because people like you chose
to download her music for free.

205
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,662
( sighs )

206
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,831
the gulfstream iii doesn't
even have a remote control

207
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,000
for its surround sound
dvd system.

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,036
still think downloading music
for free is no big deal ?

209
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,639
we... didn't realize
what we were doing.

210
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,241
that is the
folly of man.

211
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,410
now look in this window.

212
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,013
here you see the loving
family of master p.

213
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,748
next week is
his son's birthday

214
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,218
and all he's ever wanted is
an island in french polynesia.

215
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,519
so, he's gonna
get it, right ?

216
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,989
i see an island
without an owner.

217
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,291
if things keep going
the way they are

218
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,327
the child will not get
his tropical paradise.

219
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,628
we're sorry !

220
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,363
we'll never download music
for free again !

221
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,966
man must learn to think of
these horrible outcomes

222
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,436
before he acts selfishly
or else i fear...

223
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,605
recording artists
will be forever doomed

224
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,075
to a life of only
semi-luxury.

225
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,678
( sea gulls squawking )

226
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,847
almost there, guys.

227
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,582
ow.

228
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,883
why the hell did you
tell us to dress nice

229
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,184
to take us out here ?

230
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,353
because, token, we have to take
pictures for our album cover.

231
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,088
the key to a hot selling
christian rock album

232
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,257
is a flashy, inspirational
album cover.

233
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,426
wow, neat-o !
an album cover !

234
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,727
this christian album
better make as much money

235
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,763
as you said it
would, tubby.

236
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,932
i'm going to kill you
one day, token.

237
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,800
what did you say ?

238
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,667
nothing !

239
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:22,969
all right, guys,
stand over there

240
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:23,836
and look wholesome
and cool.

241
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,439
i have a timer on this thing
so i can get in shot too.

242
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,740
cheese !

243
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,608
no, no, no !

244
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,909
haven't you guys ever
seen an album cover ?

245
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,210
you're supposed to be
standing in random places,

246
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,813
looking away
like you don't care.

247
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,150
cheese !

248
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,452
( eric )

happy on a album cover !

249
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,753
that's not cool !

250
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,054
oh.

251
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,356
token, look away
to the right.

252
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,525
more... more !

253
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,826
why the hell would i be
looking way over there ?

254
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,561
so it looks like you're
too cool to care

255
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,296

trouble they caused.

268
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,735
it's all right, i think these
boys learned their lesson.

269
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,037
boy, i'll say.

270
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,338
if you parents will
just step over here

271
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,374
you can pay their $400
release and penalty fees.

272
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,676
$400 ?

273
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,411
just for downloading some
songs off the internet ?

274
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,146
it's not that
big a deal.

275
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,315
not a big deal, huh ?!

276
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,351
come with me, i'm gonna
show you something.

277
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:49,255

no !  didn't you guys
learn anything ?

282
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,496
look, if we make an album,
all that's gonna happen

283
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,665
is that people are gonna
steal our songs for free

284
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,400
off the internet !
we won't make a dime !

285
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,135
oh, yeah.

286
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,870
until we get people to stop
downloading music for free

287
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,606
i say we refuse to play !

288
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,907

has refused to play !

291
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,413

00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,715
and could go well into
next week !

293
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,317
oh, hey guys,

294
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,052

praying wallet full of cash.

ooh, this would be great
for my grandchildren.

329
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:29,021
they need hip cool music, but
with inspirational lyrics.

330
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,322
i think that's what
the whole world needs.

331
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,624

332
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,094

00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,471
but with lyrics that
inspire faith in christ.

353
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,941
yeah, we prove that christian
music can be tough and hardcore.

354
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,676
yeah, you guys
are real hardcore.

355

( whispers )

372
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,089
uh, uh, apparently
there's been a change.

373
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,559
give it up for--
faith plus one !

374

dude, i didn't know
being in a band

393
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,058
was gonna be this tough.

394
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:19,925
yeah, it's tough.

395
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,227
but it's times
like these

396
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,962
that you see what
your band is made of.

397
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,564
we've gotta fight through the
rough times likejourney.

398
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,299
tom, we're now entering
the second day

399
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,468
of the rock band moop's
refusal to play

400
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,938
and the second day of absolutely
no other news to report on.

401
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,541
in a recent poll we asked people
if moop's refusal to play

402
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,143
would stop them from downloading
music off the internet.

403
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,879
1% percent said "yes",
2% said "no",

404
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,084
and 97% said
"who the hell is moop ?"

405
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,819
back to you, tom.

406
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,120
hey, are you the guys
protesting

407
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,855
free internet music
downloading ?

408
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,590
hey, it's that
lars ulrich guy !

409
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,060
that's right, metallica is
behind you dudes %1000 !

410
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,795
we're gonna sit here
and protest with you

411
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,964
until free
downloading stops !

412
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:02,868
tom, it appears now the
musicians strike is growing.

413
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,905
as i'm speaking,
more musicians are arriving !

414
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,941
it looks like alanis morisette,
blink 182,britney spears

415
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,110
and dozens of others
are going to join moop

416
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,279
in not playing music.

417
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,181
this is a veritable
strike-apalooza !

418
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,355
guys, we here
atfaith records

419
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,524
were very moved by your
performance at christfest.

420
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,825
you're one of
the most talented

421
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,428
christian rock bands
we've ever heard !

422
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,163
thank you so much.

423
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,898
christ has really
blessed us with talent.

424
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,199
( laughing )
yeah !

425
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,368
we just had
one question, though.

426
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,537
we were looking over
some of your lyrics...

427
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:42,007
uh, "i want to walk
hand in hand with jesus

428
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,742
"on a private beach
for two.

429
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,477
"i want him to nibble
on my ear

430
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,080
"and say,
'i'm here for you'--"

431
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,683
it seems you
really love christ.

432
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,418
yes, we sure do.

433
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,586
no, but it appears
you are actually

434
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,189
in lovewith christ.

435
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,358
well, what are you
saying,

436
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,527
that you don't really
love christ ?

437
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,696
well, of course i do,
i mean, i just--

438
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,563
well, what's
the difference ?

439
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:05,864
you love christ,
you're in love with christ ?

440
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,166
i mean, what the heck
is this ?!

441
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,335
we just like to make sure
the bands we sign

442
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,937
are in it for god
and not for the money.

443
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,238
i resent that, sir.

444
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,275
i have never in my life done
anything just for the money.

445
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,877
if i'm lying, may the lord
strike me down right now.

446
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,046
uh, oh...

447
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,649

needed to know.

that people have

484
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,270
certified letter for

486
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,475
"dear moop, this letter
is to inform you

487
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,210
"that faith plus one's
debut album

488
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,813
has just sold
one million copies."

489
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,114
what ?!

490
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,415
"we cordially invite you to

491
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,716
"attend the platinum album
award ceremony

492
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,885

00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,392
p.s. nya-nya nya-nya nya, nya,
ha-ha ha-ha ha, ha."

495
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:18,163
he did it...
cartman got a platinum album.

496
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,031
is this for real ?

497
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,332
this is for real !

498
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,633
he beat us.

499
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,935
because all this time
we've been so caught up

500
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,537
with how to protect our music,
that we forgot to just play !

501
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,140
but why play if we're not gonna
make millions of dollars ?

502
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,875
because that's what
real artists do.

503
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,176
people are always
going to find a way

504
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,911
to copy our music
and swap it for free.

505
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,080
if we're real musicians,
then we should just play

506
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,249
and be stoked that so many
people are listening !

507
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,418
besides, maybe our songs would
have gotten downloaded for free,

508
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,719
but if they were good songs,

509
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,020
then people still would
have bought tickets

510
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,755
to see our band
in concert.

511
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,491
from now on, moop
isn't about money--

512
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,792
moop is about music !

513
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,093
we're not striking
anymore.

514
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,262
who's with us !

515
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,431
we're just about
the money.

516
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,298
yeah. yeah.

517
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,166
yeah.

518
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,467
oh.

519
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,768
so, dude, what are you gonna do
about your bet with cartman ?

520
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,070
are you gonna pay him ?

521
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,371
i don't have
a choice, dude.

522
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,672
i'm gonna swallow my pride,

the christian recording industry

i thought albums went
either gold or platinum.

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,485
no, no, in christian rock
our albums go gold,

559
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,221
then frankincense
then myrrh.

560
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,522
congratulations !

561
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,257

you would get a platinum album

562
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,992
not a myrrh album !

563
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,161
i don't owe you
anything, fat boy !

564
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,462
do you mean to tell me i can
never get a platinum album

565
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,763
with a christian
rock band ?

566
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,234

double myrrh.
