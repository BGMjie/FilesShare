00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,802
hi, kyle !

107
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,971
that isn't it,
cartman.

108
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,706
what isn't it ?

109
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,007
that's not being nice.

110
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,176
that's just putting on
a nice sweater.

111
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,345
i don't understand
the difference.

112
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,249
i know you don't.

113
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,418
( school bell rings )

114
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,020
jimmy !
hey jimmy, wait up !

115
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,755
dude, i need your
advice on something.

116
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,057
well sure, eric,

117
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,792
what's seems to be
the p... problem ?

118
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,527
well, everybody
likes you, jimmy,

119
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,828
and you seem to be
really good with people,

120
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,129
so i was wondering
if you could tell me,

121
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,298
how do you act nice
to people ?

122
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,033
well, the best thing is
not to act nice, eric.

123
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,636
the best thing is to be
genuinely nice.

124
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,371
okay, so how do you act
genuinely nice to people ?

125
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,106
well, eric,
part of being nice

126
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,841
is just making people
smile and laugh.

127
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,444
the best way to do that is by
telling a f-fantastic joke

128
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,914
or a humorous anecd-anecd...
anecdote.

129
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,649
like what ?

130
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,950
well, like try this one
on for size.

131
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,252
knock, knock.

132
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,119
who's there ?

133
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,589
ingmar bergman.

134
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,626
now you say
"ingmar bergman who ?".

135
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:20,927
oof !

136
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,662
take that, jimmy !
and that !

137
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,831
don't you ever talk bad
about kyle again !

138
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,132
kyle is my friend !

139
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,867
and if you say you had sex
with his mom one more time

140
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,602
i'm gonna really
let you have it !

141
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,903
you hear me ?!

142
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,506
oh, kyle, hey.

143
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,109
you really think that
beating up a handicapped kid

144
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,844
is being nice ?

145
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,615
hey, kyle !
knock knock !

146
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,784
knock knock, kyle !

147
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,194
yeah, casa bonita
this saturday !

148
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,496
wow, that's gonna
be so fun !

149
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,231
yeah it'll be awesome,
just the four of us !

150
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,966
yeah !

151
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,605
( bell rings )

152
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,774
hey, kyle.

153
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,075
well ?
well what ?

154
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,810
how are you going to
try to get invited

155
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,111
to casa bonita
this time ?

156
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,413
i'm not, kyle.

157
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,714
i know you already
told butters he could go.

158
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,015
oh, well,
yeah, i did.

159
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,750
so, fine, kyle,
but honestly,

160
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,485
i never meant to
make you feel

161
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,220
like you didn't matter
at all to me.

162
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,389
i know we argue all the time,
and i give you tons of crap,

163
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,992
but we've also been through
a lot together, and,

164
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,727
maybe that alone
doesn't make us friends

165
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,896
but it makes us something.

166
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,631
so, whatever,
you know, just,

167
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,233
i hope things
can be cool.

168
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,439
i'm still not inviting you
to casa bonita.

169
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,041
i know, kyle,
i'll see you later.

170
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,078
hey, cartman.

171
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,114
you really don't care
that you can't go ?

172
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,283
i care, sure, but i
hope it doesn't mean

173
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,885
you and me and stan and kenny
can't hang out anymore.

174
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,054
that's exactly what i wanted
to hear from you all along.

175
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,356
i still have to take butters,

176
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,091
but i hope things
can be cool too.

177
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,392
good.

178
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,127
and hey, if for some reason
butters can't go

179
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,296
to casa bonita,
you can take his place.

180
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,031
sweet, whatever.

181
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,501
bingo.

182
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,670
what's this
all about, eric ?

183
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,971
butters, can you
keep a secret ?

184
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,272
well, sure i can !

185
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,875
for the past five days i've
been looking out into space

186
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,176
for a school project.

187
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,478
this morning
at 3:45 a.m.

188
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,213
i caught first sight of
something terrible.

189
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,514
how terrible ?

190
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,815
a meteor.

191
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,550
a meteor the size
of wyoming--

192
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,852
heading right for earth.

193
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:26,719
what ?!

194
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,020
now look,
i could be wrong !

195
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,888
i pray that i'm wrong,

196
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,623
but i just want you
to take a look

197
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,093
and see what you think.

198
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:34,961
do you see
anything ?

199
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,262
i just see stars.

200
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,563
keep looking.

201
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,298
sometimes it takes your eyes
a minute to adjust.

202
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,033
nope, i don't see any--
whoa, wait !

203
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,202
oh my god !
i see it, i see it !

204
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,937
it's a meteor !
oh my god !

205
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,239
oh my god !

206
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,841
does it look like
it's getting closer ?

207
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,878
it is !
it is getting closer !

208
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,179
oh my god !

209
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,914
oh my god, that meteor
is the size of wyoming

210
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,215
and it's on a collision
course for earth !

211
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,517
when do you think
it'll get here ?

212
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,553
i, i don't know, i have to
do some calculations.

213
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,288
10 to the power
of one base nine,

214
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,192
divided by pi,
plus five minus three...

215
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,493
oh jesus.

216
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,361
what ?!

217
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,662
according to
my calculations,

218
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,397
that meteor's gonna hit earth
in less than four hours.

219
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,698
oh, you mean
we're gonna die ?

220
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,000
no !

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,867
no, butters, we are
going to live !

222
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,602
do you hear me ?
we are going to live !

223
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,470
we've just,

224
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,771
we've gotta find
a bomb shelter !

225
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,072
where is there
a bomb shelter ?

226
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,374
stan's uncle jimbo !

227
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,675
he has a bomb shelter
in his back yard !

228
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,543
come on, butters,
hurry !

229
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,711
aaaghh !

230
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,880
here we go, bomb
shelter's down here !

231
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,049
oh god !
oh jesus !

232
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,652
all right, we should be
safe in here.

233
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,387
there's dried food and water
to last us for weeks.

234
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,122
but what about
everyone else ?

235
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,857
i have to tell my parents so
they can come here too !

236
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,592
no, butters, i can't
let you risk it !

237
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,893
i'll go up
and get the others.

238
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,195
are you sure ?

239
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,363
i'm not sure of
anything anymore.

240
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,135
now butters, listen--
no matter what happens,

241
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,870
no matter what you hear,
do not come out.

242
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,039
if i don't make it back
in time with the others,

243
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,208
then it will be up to you
to repopulate the earth.

244
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,509
but i'm the
only one down here,

245
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,244
what am i supposed to
repopulate with ?

246
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,847
well, you know,
with your wiener.

247
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,883
just stay down here until
you hear word from me.

248
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,787
and pray, butters,
pray for all mankind.

249
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,426
oh god.
oh god.

250
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,462
where is butters ?

251
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,197
we were supposed to leave
40 minutes ago !

252
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,366
well, i think we better
just go without him, kyle.

253
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,234
it's getting late.

254
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,402
yeah, screw him,
let's go.

255
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,270
( doorbell rings )

256
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,005
oh, finally !

257
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,740
happy birthday, kyle.

258
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,475
i just wanted to stop by
and give you your present.

259
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,210
oh, thanks, dude.

261
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,114
oh, wait, cartman.

262
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,415
yes ?

263
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,150
butters didn't show.

264
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,886
you wanna go to
casa bonita with us ?

265
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,488
butters didn't show ?
i can't believe it.

266
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,223
are you sure you told him the
right time and everything ?

267
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,958
i told him 5:30, and
we gotta get going.

268
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,260

269
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,561
well, i really would need to
go home first and get my--

270
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,296
well, no, i guess i have
everything i need.

271
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,163
okay, sure.

272
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,465
all right, let's go !

273
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,766
okay, boys,
get in the car.

274
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,935
casa bonita,
here we come !

275
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,670
oh, hello,
chris, linda.

276
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,971
hello, everyone.

277
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,574
have any of you
seen our son ?

278
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,610
butters was supposed to go with
us to casa bonita tonight.

279
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,080
we know, but, he hasn't been
home since last night.

280
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,249
the police have been
looking everywhere but--

281
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,551
( sobbing )

282
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,852
well, thank you.

283
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,454
please, let us know
if you find out anything.

284
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:19,792
( wailing )
oh, butters !

285
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,093
oh dude, weak.

286
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,395
yeah, man, that sucks
about butters.

287
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,130
well, let's get going,
shall we ?

288
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,299
nah... dude, i can't go to
have a birthday party

289
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,600
while butters is missing.

290
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,901
yeah, it's kinda weird.

291
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,070
yeah, yeah,
i think you're right

292
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,371
but, on the other hand,

293
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,106
i think butters
would want us to go.

294
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,408
you know butters.

295
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,709
nah, i can't.

296
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,577
we should help
look for him.

297
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,878
yeah.

298
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,179
that's very good
of you, boys.

299
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,914
we can postpone casa bonita
until next saturday.

300
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,215
next saturday ?!

301
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,818
i'll never be able to keep
butters down in the--

302
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,421
in the depths of my heart
for that long.

303
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,156
i sure hope he
turns up before then.

304
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,457
dude, we should check
over at starks' pond,

305
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,758
butters always
hangs out over there.

306
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,060
yeah, and then we can
try the football field.

307
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,662
i'll drive you boys.

308
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,831
aw, god dammit !

309
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,566
how am i gonna keep butters
down in that bomb shelter

310
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,434
for a whole week ?!

311
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,674
all right, folks, this is the
little boy we're looking for:

312
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,144
leopold stotch,
also known as "butters".

313
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,879
he's been missing
for two days

314
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,181
and was last seen
at the school.

315
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,350
let's go find 'im !

316
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,422
"dried food rations.

317
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,025
add water to
beef-flavored square..."

318
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,760
hello ?

319
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,929
hello !

320
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,664
butters !

321
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,965
aaaagh !

322
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:33,833
butters !

323
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,134
oh god, it was,
it was horrible !

324
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,869
what happened ?

325
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,170
the meteor--

326
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,905
struck the earth sooner
than i predicted.

327
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,207
there was no time.

328
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,942
no time.

329
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,809
what about my parents ?

330
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,111
did you see them ?

331
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,846
there was mass
confusion, panic.

332
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,147
people were crawling all over
each other in the streets,

333
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,448
it was awful !

334
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:50,750
then it hit.

335
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,051
millions were
evaporated instantly.

336
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,352
the rest of us,

337
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,521
walking around in a cloud
of toxic radiation.

338
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,822
( coughs )

339
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,124
oh my god,
let me see !

340
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,425
no, butters !

341
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,726
if you come up,
you'll get infected too.

342
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,329
you best wait for the
radiation levels to go down.

343
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,498
probably...
next week sometime.

344
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,799
after saturday.

345
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,100
how many survivors
are there ?

346
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,402
you should all
come down here !

347
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,703
we can't come down there

348
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,438
or else we'll
contaminate you, butters.

349
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,041
no, we just have to survive
best we can.

350
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,209
wow...

351
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,378
eric, i can never
thank you enough

352
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,113
for everything
you've done for me.

353
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,848
thank me by living,
butters.

354
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,885
live and rebuild.

355
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,620
( coughs )
i've got to go.

356
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,222
remember, wait one week for
the toxic levels to go down.

357
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,524
after saturday.

358
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,994
good-bye.

359
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,163
all right,
just six days, butters.

360
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,464
sit tight.

361
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,633
tom, it has now been
three days

362
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,235
since the stotch child
has gone missing.

363
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,272
townspeople continue to search
but hope is dwindling.

364
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,874
all right, folks, i wanna
thank you for all your efforts.

365
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,043
three days is a long time,

366
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,212
but we've got to keep going
if we're gonna find him.

367
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,947
( eric )
you're not going to find him.

368
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,851
not until after saturday when
i finally go to casa bonita.

369
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,454
( mariachi music )

370
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,960
many times in cases like these
a child can trap themselves.

371
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,695
it's important that
we spread our search

372
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,165
to duct pipes, wells
and bomb shelters.

373
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,467
( record needle scratch )

374
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,635
wha-- whoa-- what ?

375
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,937
i say we need to
move the search

376
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,106
to ducts, wells
and bomb shelters.

377
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,708
let's move out, people,
every second counts.

378
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,612

eric, is that you ?

385
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,228
oh god !
they're coming !

386

they're coming !

387
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,396
we've gotta get
out of here !

388
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,264
they're coming
this way !

389
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,565
who's coming this way ?

390
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,867
the cannibals !
don't you know ?!

391
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,602
the meteor destroyed
all society, butters,

392
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,771
now earth is ruled by packs
of wild humans gone mad !

393
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,939
those of us who survived
are now being hunted

394
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,241
by flesh-starved
cannibals !

395
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,976
oh god !
i hate cannibals !

396
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,277
they're coming
this way.

397
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,578
i can hear them.

398
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,880
they'll find you
down here for sure,

399
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,181
and when they do,
they'll eat you alive.

400
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,482
no !

401
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,784
we gotta get you
out of here, come on !

402
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,952
oh no, wait, i forgot--
the toxic radiation !

403
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,121
hey, wait,
we can use this box !

404
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,724
there we go, that should keep
you protected from the toxins.

405
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,025
but i can't see nothing.

406
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,628
believe me, butters, you don't
want to see what's up there.

407
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,664
now, come on, i'll guide you
to a safer location.

408
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,399
there you go.

409
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,568
two more steps
and you're at the top.

410
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,435
good.

411
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,737
are we out in
the destruction ?

412
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,038
yes.

413
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,339
there's nothing but smoldering
bodies all around you,

414
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,508
burnt out buildings and
what used to be our town.

415
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:30,810
oh, man.

416
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,111
all right, this way,
butters,

417
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,280
just follow the sound
of my voice.

418
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,448
right now we're walking by what
used to be people's houses.

419
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,184
now just smoldering,
burnt piles of rubble.

420
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,352
oh, oh,
it's terrible !

421
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,521
we're coming now to the crater
where the meteor hit:

422
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,690
a hole in the earth over
two miles in diameter.

423
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,425
whoa...

424
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,594
here we are at
the old gas station.

425
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,895
it survived
a lot of the impact.

426
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,630
we might be safe here.

427
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:52,932
brrragagahgh !

428
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,799
oh my god !

429
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,100
what ?

430
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,836
it's a cannibal !
stay back, cannibal !

431
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,004
brraagaggahagh !

432
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,306
aaaagh !

433
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,173
i've got to
fight them off !

434
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,474
agh !
agh !

435
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,643
stay away from butters,
he's humanity's last hope !

436
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,378
bragaaggah !
braahaggh !

437
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,680
agh !
he bit me !

438
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,981
he bit off my hand !

439
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,282
aaaaaaaaaagh !

440
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,017
oh god, he's eating my hand
like a piece of chicken !

441
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,752
can you hear
the bones crack ?

442
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,487
argashsgh !

443
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,789
ohhh !

444
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,090
wait, look here !

445
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,825
there's a dead body
with an axe in the back !

446
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,693
i'll pull out the axe

447
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,428
and use it to cut off
the cannibal's head !

448
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,729
ha !

449
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,030
die !

450
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,332
glarg !

451
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,067
what happened ?
what happened ?!

452
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,236
the cannibal...

453
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,971
the cannibal is dead,
butters.

454
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,706
but he bit me, which means
soon i will have a thirst

455
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,007
for human flesh as well.

456
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,875
oh, no !

457
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,176
we have no choice,
butters,

458
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,043
we have to lock you
away somewhere

459
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,345
where even i can't
get to you.

460
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,212
where ?

461
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,381
look, there's an old
refrigerator !

462
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,682
get inside, butters !

463
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:44,984
i'll break off the handle
so nobody can get to you.

464
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,285
are you coming ?

465
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,152
it's too late for me.

466
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,888
i can already feel my body
start to change.

467
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,490
no, must fight it !

468
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,526
don't open this door
for anybody, butters.

469
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,563
no matter what you hear,
stay inside for four days.

470
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,732
here's some water and food
from the shelter.

471
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,202
eric, you're the best friend
in the whole world.

472
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,937
i... i love you.

473
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,238
i love you too, man.

474
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,841
i-- ooh, you look
so delicious !

475
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,576
must eat your brains !

476
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,311
aaaaagh !

477
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:16,649
( chuckles )

478
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,662
( alarm rings )

479
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,397
hah !

480
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,565

black bart's cave first !

483
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,506
no-- i'm gonna watch
the cliff divers first !

484
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,241
maybe if i tell 'em
it's my birthday,

485
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,976
they'll let me cliff dive
into the pool !

486
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,578
oh, that would be
so bad-ass !

487
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,651
( thumping )

488
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,989
( coughing and gasping )

489
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,724
oh, finally,
i can breathe the--

490
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,893
oh my god.

491
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,230
oh my god, the meteor
took out everything !

492
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:10,002
it's all destroyed...
nothing left.

493
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,303
hello !

494
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,906
are there any other
survivors ?

495
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,075
hello !

496
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,677
ooh, that must have been
where the library was.

497
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,412
and that was probably
the school.

498
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,581
hello ?

499
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,919
oh, i forgot, i gotta watch out
for radioactive cannibals.

500
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,088
is that a cannibal ?

501
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,823
sir, ma'am ?

502
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,594
oh !

503
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,329
oh, it's a little dog !

504
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,630
well, hello there,
mr. dog.

505
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,932
looks like you and me
are the only ones

506
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,233
that survived the meteor.

507
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,402
we should stick together,
huh, mr. dog ?

508
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,571
well, come on, we gotta start
cleaning up this mess

509
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,740
and rebuilding civilization.

510
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,342
boy, that meteor sure did
make everything stinky.

00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,055
where you can dress up
in old western clothes

516
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,790

00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,598
i think we should go through
black bart's cave right away

523
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,899
'cause we're gonna wanna
do it seven or eight times.

524
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,200
and then we'll watch
the cliff divers

525
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,502

it's kyle's birthday.

527
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,670
