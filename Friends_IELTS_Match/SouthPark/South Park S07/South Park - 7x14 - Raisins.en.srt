i'm nine years old, dude !

182
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,288
if i don't work things out
with wendy,

183
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,589
i could be
alone my whole life !

184
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:04,891
she wants to see me

185

myraisinsgirl said
she wants to see me again !

186
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,795
i can't let wendy go !

187
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,096
this whole time i've
been having my friends

it's time i took control !

189
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,132
what are you doing ?

190
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,036
something i should have done
a long time ago.

191
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,652
bebe, you need to go
talk to wendy for me right now !

192
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,122
all this time i've been trying
to have my friends do all

193
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,989
the talking for me.

194
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,724
now, i realize i need her
friends to do it.

195
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,592
tell her i love her.

196
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,327
stan, why don't you show her
you love her.

197
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,628
if you really want wendy back,

198
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,797
try doing the most romantic
thing you can think of.

199
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,569
okay, so what's the most
romantic thing i can think of ?

200
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,870
if you really want a shot
at getting her back...

201
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,171
stand outside her window,

202
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,641
hold a boom box up over your
head and play peter gabriel.

203
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,883

219
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,465

00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,634

you are such a sweetie.

oh wow, thanks, cutie !

00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,587
well, yeah, but-- but--
hey-- hey, lexus ?

231
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,623
i was thinking, well, i was
thinking that we should

232
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,358
go do something,
sometime...

233
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,660
oh gee, that would
be great, honey,

234
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,961
but i'm really
busy this week.

235
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,696
tell you what,
you come back toraisins,

236
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,865
and then we'll be able to
hang out all we want, okay ?!

237
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,166
o-kay !

238
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,202
bye, cutie !
bye, darling !

239
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,275
wow, a real-life
relationship !

240
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,812
( school bell ringing )

241
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,415
( chattering )

242
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,451
( man )
all right, kids, out on the gym
floor for p.e. class !

243
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,524
come on stan, we're
gonna to play dodge ball.

244
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,126
i can't believe it.

245
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,295
she's in love
with somebody else.

246
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,464
dude, you need to
snap out of this !

247
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,199
so wendy left you for token,
what are you gonna do,

248
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,934
just be miserable
your whole life ?

249
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,235
there's nothing else
icando,

250
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,103
she was my whole life.

251
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,404
oh, come on, dude !

252
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,573
all you've done for the last
four days is mope around !

253
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,742
you might as well go
hang out with those goth kids,

254
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,345
who dress in black and talk
about pain all the time !

255
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,947
maybe i should, at least
they would understand me.

256
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,550
maybe i should go hang
with the goth kids.

257
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,887
life is pain,
life is only pain.

258
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,056
we're all taught to believe in
happy, fairy tale endings,

259
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,791
but there
is only blackness.

260
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,695
dark, depressing loneliness
that eats at your soul.

261
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,298
who needs that
ken and barbie love, anyway ?

262
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,900
everyone's just walking around
like a bunch of conformists.

263
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,202
go ahead and wear
your business suits,

264
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,238
so you can make $34,0000 a year
and buy your condominium.

265
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,407
they're like zombies,
racing to their graves.

266
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,576
love didn't work for
my mom and dad,

267
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,311
why should
it work for me ?

268
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,913
my dad is such an asshole,

269
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,649
drunken bastard doesn't even
know i exist,

270
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,817
but then he won't let me
go to the skinny puppy concert

271
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,986
because my heroin addict aunt
is coming over for dinner.

272
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,721
dinner ?
that's a laugh,

273
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,456
just an excuse for my mom
to bitch at me

274
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,758
for not wearing girly clothes

275
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,794
like all the britney spears
wannabes at this school.

276
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:06,999
they're all a bunch of
nazi conformist cheerleaders.

277
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,469
but if life is only pain,

278
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,204
then, what's the point
of living ?

279
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,241
just to make life more
miserable for the conformists.

280
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,843
all right, so how
do i join you ?

281
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,012
if you want to be one of the
non-conformists,

282
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,747
all you have to do
is dress just like us

283
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,350
and listen to the same music
we do.

284
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,085
'kay.

285
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,724
okay, i know it's
your first day, ferrari,

286
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,025
so i want to go over
the basics with you.
okay.

287
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,628
first of all,
there's a five-foot rule:

288
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,363
if you come within five feet
of a customer,

289
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,230
you need to acknowledge them,

290
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,399
even if they're not at
your table, "hey, cutie !"

291
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,002
when you're not serving food
or talking with customers,

292
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,303
you need to dance
around and have fun.

293
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,906
we have things like hoola-hoops,
silly string and water guns

294
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,207
to play with the other girls.

295
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,376
be sure to giggle a lot, and be
sure to show off your raisins.

296
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,111
now, when you take
a customer's order,

297
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,412
you need to sit down at
the table with them.

298
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,147
it makes them
think you're interested.

299
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,316
write your name down for them,
and make them feel special.

300
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,352
"oh man, i am so bored,
thank god you guys came in !"

301
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,654
if you want good tips,

302
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,389
the most important thing
is physical contact,

303
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,558
just a simple hold of
the arm can be the difference

304
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,727
between $5 and $20.

305
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,329
"i'll be right back with
your order, guys !"

306
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,064
wow, thank you
so much, mercedes.

307
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,667
okay, well i guess we're ready
to open for business, good luck.

308
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,269
go ahead and open
for business, porsche.

309
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,438
okay !

310
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,475
hi, welcome toraisins !

311
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,643

312
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,246
hey, cutie !

313
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,547
how're we doing today ?!

314
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,451
oh god, i missed you
so much.

315
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:37,656
"shallow life,
drowning alone i gasp for air.

316
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,825
"coldness creeps over
pale skin.

317
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,428
"there is sadness
so deep it pulls me down.

318
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,332
happiness dies in the deep,
dark sea."

319
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,934
yeah, happiness dies.

320
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,669
yeah.

321
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:51,971
all right,
your turn, stan.

322
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,007
read one of your poems
about pain.

323
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,308
"there is darkness
all around me.

324
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,911
"deep, piercing
black i cannot breathe.

325
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,212
my heart has
been raped."

326
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,514
whoa.

327
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,682
"the pain is everlasting,
i miss you so much, babe.

328
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,851
want to hold you
in my arms again, girl--"

329
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,888
whoa, whoa, dude, those last
two lines aren't goth.

330
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,189
they're not ?

331
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,924
no, dude, you can't say,
"i miss you so much, babe.

332
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,225
i want to hold
you in my arms."

333
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,828
make it, "i miss seeing you
so much, i want to slice

334
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,430
my eyes out
with razor blades."

335
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,599
henrietta,
hi, sweetie !

336
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,901
go away, mom !
leave me alone !

337
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,503
daddy and i just got your
birthday present !

338
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,106
but you can't see
what it is 'til tomorrow !

339
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,841
you'd like to wait 'til i was
dead, wouldn't you ?

340
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,010
you'd like to see
the maggots eat my face.

341
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,745
you are so creative,
honey !

342
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,347

embarrass me or nothing,

395
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,296
i'm sure she'll be real nervous
to impress you.

396
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,597
don't worry, butters,

397
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,766
we just want to say hi and then
we'll leave you two alone !

398
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,501

00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,394
dude, you haven't
drank your coffee.

409
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,129
well, i don't
drink coffee.

410
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,599
you can't be a non-conformist
if you don't drink coffee.

411
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,805
oh, jesus christ.
i had to see it to believe it.

412
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,106
what the hell are you doing ?

413
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,576
i'm breathing deep the darkness
that envelopes my soul.

414
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:21,046
god damn it, dude, your mom
and dad want you to come home !

415
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,215
so they can fill my head
with moredisneylies

416
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,516
about how
perfect the world is ?

417
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,818
i don't think so.

418
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,553
yeah, why don't you just go back
to your justin timberlake

419
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,288
and your homework,
you conformist asshole.

420
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,023
you just don't know what
real pain is.

421
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,758
oh, like you
know what pain is !

422
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,493

country, you little pussy !

423
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,228
i'm not gonna live
in a third world country

424
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,529
with all the conformists !

425
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,264
stan, this is it, time to stop
feeling sorry for yourself,

426
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:40,566
and come home.

427
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,301
everyone cares about you
and everyone wants you back.

428
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,036
what about wendy ?
is she still with token ?

429
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,337
yeah, she is.

430
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,072
then, people shouldn't
care about me,

431
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,807
'cause i don't
care about them.

432
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,976
what's the point of caring
when all it brings is pain ?

433
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,277
for sure.

434
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,314
fine, that's it, i give up,
have fun being miserable.

435
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,615

452
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,622
oh boy, i think i know
what's happened.

453
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,357
our son hasn't learned yet
that girls will pretend to

454
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,092
like him for money.

455
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,128
this place is horrible,
to objectify girls like this !

456
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,297
hi guys, can i take
your order ?

457
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,032
little girl,
you shouldn't be working here.

458
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,333
i shouldn't ?!

459
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,635
where am i supposed
to be working ?!

460
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,237
no, i mean you shouldn't work
somewhere where you're paid

461
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,840
for how you look,
you should be learning a skill,

462
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,575
so you can grow up to be
a business woman

463
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,443
or even a doctor.

464
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,611
who knows,
you could cure cancer !

465
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,479
i could cure cancer ?!

466
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,648
oh my god,
that would be so cool !

467
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,383
i had a cancer sore
on my lip once,

468
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,118
and it hurt so bad !

469
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:10,022
oh, nevermind, i thinkraisins

470
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,323

471
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,227

00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,962
hi, welcome
toraisins !

473
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,432
uh, butters, can we have
a little talk with you ?

474
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,733
outside.

475
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,469
huh, oh, anything
you have to say to me,

476
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,204
you can say in front
of lexus !

477
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,674
butters, these girls pretend
to be interested in you

478
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,843
because they know
you'll give them tips.

479
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,710
huh ?

480
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,313
you see, butters, women know
that they can make men do

481
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,048
anything by flirting.

482
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,518
and some girls, like these,
turn that into a profession.

483
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,422
oh i see, you don't approve
of my girlfriend !

484
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,157
well, let me tell you
something, mom and dad,

485
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,892
our love is as pure as
a mountain spring !

486
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,627
the odds may be
stacked against us,

487
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,928
but we're gonna give it
our best shot !

488
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,663
and so if you
can't be happy for us,

489
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,700
you can just go to heck,
mom and dad !

490
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,567
come on, lexus !

491
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:56,869

you saying ?

496
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,448
are you saying you don't
want to be together anymore ?

497
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,315
i'm sorry, sweetie.

498
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,352

well, go ahead and go.

501
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,593
it's best we don't say
anything more.

502
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,328
there's nothing left to say...

503
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:27,232
it's over...
our relationship is over...

broke up with me.

514
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,765
did she step on your
heart with stiletto shoes ?

515
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,801
yeah,
it sure does hurt.

516
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,404
that's cool, i guess you can
join up with us if you want.

517
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,139
yeah, we're gonna go to
the graveyard and write poems

518
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,741
about death and how
pointless life is.

519
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,778
oh, no, thanks,
i love life.

520
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,380
huh ?  but you
just got dumped.

521
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,682
well, yeah, and i'm sad.

522
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,850
but at the same time,
i'm really happy that something

523
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,019
can make me feel
that sad.

524
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,056
it's like... it makes
me feel alive, you know ?

525
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,791
it makes me feel human.

526
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,393
the only way i could feel this
sad now is if i felt something

527
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,695
really good before,

528
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,863
so i have to take
the bad with the good,

529
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,900
so i guess what i'm feeling
is like a 'beautiful sadness'...

530
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,635
i guess that
sounds stupid.

531
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,936
yeah.

532
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,973
no, no, butters, that doesn't
sound stupid at all.

533
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,141
but thanks for offering
to let me in your clique, guys,

534
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,744
but to be honest, i'd rather
be a crying, little pussy

535
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,214
than a faggy goth kid,
well, see ya, stan.

536
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:53,118
he's right, i don't
even know who i am anymore.

537
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,853
i like liking life a lot
more than hating it.

538
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,889
screw you, guys,
i'm going home.

539
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,661
go ahead and go back to
your sunshine fairy tale !

540
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,300
okay, it's third down !

541
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,469
now, somebody
make a play !

542
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,336
hey, can
i join in ?

543
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,939
what happened, aren't you
still wallowing in pain ?

544
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,975
yeah, it still hurts a lot,
but i just realized that

545
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,710
there's going to be a lot
of painful times in life,

546
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,614
so i better learn to deal
with it the right way.

547
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,349
hey, wendy !

548
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,084

549
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:26,952

550
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,988

551
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,458

to have you back.
