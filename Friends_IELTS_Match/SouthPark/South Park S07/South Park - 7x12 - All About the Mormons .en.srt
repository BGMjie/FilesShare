but your skin
is white.

186
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,236
yes, long ago all
native americans were white.

187
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,839
we all came to america
from jerusalem,

188
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,875
and while we were here
we were visited by christ.

189
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,478
jesus lived
here in america ?

190
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,080
yes, eventually my people
were all killed

191
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,249
by the other tribe of israel.

192
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,285
and as punishment,
god turned their skin red.

193
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,322

americans you know today.

00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,592
hey dad, how come you never
told me about joseph smith ?

225
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,893
who ?

226
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,062
shut up, turd,
we're watching "friends" !

227
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,231
the guy who spoke to
god and jesus.

228
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,267
well, stan, god and jesus
don't actually speak to people.

229
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,569
that's not what
the harrisons said.

230
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,304
who are the harrisons ?

231
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,605
the new people that
moved in down the street.

232
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,208
mr. harrison said that joseph
smith spoke to god and jesus

233
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,943
and they told him none of
the religions were right.

234
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,678
oh, did he now ?

235
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,979
what are they,
religious kooks ?

236
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,714
they're not kooks,
they're cool !

237
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,449
how come we never have a night
where we don't watch any tv

238
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,184
and we just do stuff together
and eat and drink ?

239
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,787
we have that, stan,
it's called friday night kegger.

240
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,088
but that's just you
and your friends !

241
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,257
i said shut up, turd !

242
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,558
mr. harrison said that
i need to be following

243
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,860
heavenly father's plan,

244
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,161
and i don't even know
what that is !

245
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,462
all right,
that does it.

246
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,763
where are you going ?

247
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,366
i'm gonna go have a talk
with this mr. harrison.

248
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,101

randy, don't cause trouble.

251
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,174
let me handle this, sharon.

252
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,909
you gotta put these cult
people in their place

253
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,644
or else they never stop.

254
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,813

255
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,150

256
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,452

257
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,187

believe, will you ?

280
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,736
look, uh, i actually
came over

281
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,038
because i'm a little
concerned

282
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,206
about some of the things
you told my son.

283
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,942
uh-huh. uh-huh.

284
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:40,279
you know, about...
god and stuff.

285
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,014
oh...

286
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,617
oh boy, you think we were
trying to convert him.

287
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,918
well, i--

288
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,087
oh, mr. marsh,
i am so sorry.

289
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,822
we just moved here
from utah

290
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,991
and we're so used to everyone
being mormon that we--

291
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,160
we forget not everyone
wants to hear about it !

292
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,895
oh boy, you
must be furious !

293
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,497
well... no,
no, i just--

294
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,100
you just heard your son
talking about religious ideals

295
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,401
that aren't your own
and you said,

296
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,004
"who the heck do these
people think they are ?"

297
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,173
i'm really,
truly sorry, mr. marsh,

298
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,908
it won't happen again.

299
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,077
you can...
call me randy.

300
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,378
randy, the last thing we want
is for people to think

301
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,113
we're pushing our religion.

302
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,414
we know there are a lot
of beliefs out there

303
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,149
and ours just
works for us.

304
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,884
to each his own,
right ?

305
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,620
yeah.

306
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,921
yeah !

307
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,090
you know, to be honest,
i've never known any mormons,

308
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,258
i don't even know
what you people believe.

309
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,427
who was this
joseph smith guy ?

310
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,162
why did he believe
that native americans

311
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,765
were actually white people
from jerusalem ?

312
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,066
well, because he found
ancient books

313
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,801
they had written
on gold plates.

314
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,838
right where the angel moroni
said they would be.

315
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,344
i found them !
i found them !

316
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,513
you're not gonna
believe it, everybody !

317
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,814
i found them !

318
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,116
found what ?

319
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,718
another new testament
of jesus christ !

320
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,321
what ?!
what'd he say ?

321
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,923
last night, a native american
angel told me

322
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,526
where i could find another
testament of jesus christ,

323
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,129
so i went out to the woods...

324
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,731
i dug around all morning where
the angel had told me to look.

325
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,334
hmmm, maybe there isn't
anything out here.

326
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,201
( clink )

327
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,370
wait a tick !
what's this ?

328
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,973
wow...

329
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,443
inside the stone box, i found
the magical seer stones.

330
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,612
under that, i found
four gold plates

331
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,214
written in
strange writing.

332
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,817
this must be the gospel that
jesus told the nephites !

333
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,853
well, they were the most amazing
things i'd ever gazed upon !

334
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,155
well,
so where are they ?

335
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,890
where are what ?

336
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,191
the gold plates and
the seer stones !

337
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,492
where are they ?

338
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,794
oh.

339
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,529
oh, well, i was not
allowed to take them.

340
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,698
you see, after i found
the plates

341
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,866
the angel moroni
appeared to me again

342
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,035
and said that i am not
allowed to show the plates

343
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,638
or the seer stones
to anybody !

344
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,240
because first i must translate
what's written on the plates

345
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,409

martin, except--

558
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,729
i just had a vision.

559
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,898

very angry with me

00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,633
for letting you
take those pages !

he is so mad that

translate from the plate
of lehi again.

566
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,911
he said we must now translate
from the plate of nephi.

567
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,080
so it will be
the same basic story,

568

but written a little
differently.

if god got angry with you

let's get to work !

574
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,864
and that's
how it happened !

575
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,599
yeah !
all right !

576
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,937
wait, mormons actually
know this story

577
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,540
and they still believe
joseph smith was a prophet.

578
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,708
well sure, the story
proves it, doesn't it ?

579
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,877
no, it proves he did
make it all up !

580
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,179
are you blind ?!

581
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,914
well, stan, it's all
a matter of faith !

582
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,649
no, it's a matter
of logic !

583
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,950
if you're gonna say things
that have been proven wrong,

584
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,685
like that the first man and
woman lived in missouri

585
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,854
and that native americans
came from jerusalem,

586
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,589
then you better have
something to back it up !

587
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,758
all you've got are a bunch of
stories about some asswipe

588
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,059
who read plates nobody
ever saw out of a hat

589
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,360
and then couldn't do it again

590
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,095
when the translations
were hidden !

591
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,264
hey, stan, don't
denounce our religion.

592
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,433
i don't want to be
mormon, dad !

593
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,168
me neither.

594
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,469
hey, that's totally
cool, guys,

595
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,771
you can believe
whatever you want !

596
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,506
yeah, it's great you have
your own beliefs !

597
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,807
yeah !

598
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,108
yay for the marshes !

599
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,410
oh, stop it !

600
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,711
that's another thing !

601
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,012
why do you have to be so
frickin' nice all the time ?

602
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,314
it isn't normal !

603
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,049
you just weasel people
into your way of thinking

604
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,350
by acting like the happiest
family in the world

605
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,085
and being so nice to everyone

606
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,254
that you just blindside
dumb people like my dad !

607
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,555
yeah !

608
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,062
( sighs )
well, kids...

609
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,664
who's up for a water
balloon fight ?!

610
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,966
yeah !

611
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,906
oh, hey stan, where's your
best buddy gary ?

612
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,641
i'm not hanging around
that kid anymore.

613
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,810
oh, no,
you guys broke up ?

614
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,412
you guys were right, okay ?
the new kid's a douche.

615
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,147
now i just gotta find a way
to keep him away from me.

616
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,449
hey, stan.

617
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,750
oh, brother.

618
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,919
uh-oh, the jilted
lover returns !

619
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,220
listen, i just wanted
to let you know

620
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,088
you don't have to
worry about me

621
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,389
trying to be
your friend anymore.

622
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,690
i don't ?

623
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,425
look, maybe us mormons do
believe in crazy stories

624
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,727
that make
absolutely no sense.

625
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,462
and maybe joseph smith
did make it all up--

626
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,064
but i have a great life
and a great family.

627
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,799
and i have the book of mormon
to thank for that.

628
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,836
the truth is, i don't care if
joseph smith made it all up.

629
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,137
because what the
church teaches now

630
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,740
is loving your family,
being nice and helping people.

631
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,908
and even though people in this
town might think that's stupid,

632
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,077
i still choose
to believe in it.

633
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,246
all i ever did was try to
be your friend, stan.

634
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,547
but you're so
high and mighty

635
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,415
you couldn't
look past my religion

636
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,716
and just be my friend back.

637
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,451
you've got a lot of
growing up to do, buddy.

638
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,186
suck my balls.

639
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,693
damn, that kid is
cool, huh ?
