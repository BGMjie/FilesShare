straight guy" comes on, right ?

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,345
so i fall asleep
in front of the tv

00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,579
it's "queer eye for the
straight guy" !

we have got to get you some
tighter fitting shirts !

55
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,651
then it's "boy meets boy"
followed by "will and grace".

56
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,122
and then: "the love boat...
with men".

57
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,290
my goodness, there certainly
are a lot of gay shows

58
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,025
on television these days.

59
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,327
yeah, i think it's great

60
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,496
that gays are finally
being so accepted.

61
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,664
hi, mom, hi, dad !

62
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,966
aaaah !

63
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,135
kyle, what's
happened to you ?

64
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,436
i'm just trying
to fit in, daddy,

65
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,605
don't be such
a drama queen.

66
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,340
oh my god !

67
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,075

what's going on !

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,111
( doorbell rings,
knocking )

70
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,412
oh, hi, gerald, sheila.

71
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,714
hi, sharon.

72
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,449
we need to talk to you
about the boys.

73
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,316
sure, come on in.

74
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,618
the guys are all
watching tv.

75
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,353
oh, is the game on
or something ?

76
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,088
( dance music )

77
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,257
hey, gerald !
how are you ?

78
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,425
hi, gerald !
gerald !

79
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,727
sit down, ger-ger.

80
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,462
"queer eye for the
straight guy" is on.

81
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,197
oh no, you guys all
turned gay too ?

82
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,366
( laughter )

83
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,968
not gay, gerald--
metrosexual.

84
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,703
what's that ?

85
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,438
just because a guy
cares about how he looks

86
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,740
and is in touch with
his feminine side

87
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,475
doesn't mean he's
gay anymore !

88
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,210
yeah, metrosexual
means you're straight

89
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,379
but you appreciate
the gay culture.

90
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,415
it's super fabulous,
would you like some shiraz ?

91
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,584
don't our men
look amazing ?

92
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,885
haven't you seen

93
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,620
"queer eye for the
straight guy", sheila ?

94
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,488
these five gay men go around

95
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,657
and show straight men
how to better themselves.

96
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,958
it's the best !

97
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,825
it is ?

98
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,127
well, sure, sheila,

99
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,428
our husbands are all
so clean and neat.

100
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,031
my randy irons his clothes
and even has pedicures !

101
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,332
and they like to talk about
their feelings now

102
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,501
and drink wine
and decorate the house !

103
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,236
my steven
shaved his chest.

104
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,405
and his balls !
ooh, i love it !

105
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,140
and how about
our boys, huh ?

106
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,441
ever since gay culture
became cool

107
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,742
our boys bathe every night

108
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,477
and brush their teeth
three times a day.

109
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,213
this is the
greatest thing ever.

110
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,514
i don't know,

111
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,116
sometimes boys take
cultural fads too far.

112
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,851
( school bell rings )

113
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,020
dude, i can't wait for wendy
to see how gay i look !

114
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,322
that's true, you guys,

115
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,623
when the chicks at school
see how gay we are,

116
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,924
they're gonna be
all over us.

117
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,226
woo-hoo !

118
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,262

thanks !

128
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,311
not as gay as us, though.

129
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,914
oh please, craig, we're
10 times gayer than you !

130
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,781
oh yeah ?

131
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,083
we're super-duper
triple-dog gay !

132
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,384

133
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,553
we're ultra-super-stamp-it
stamp-it-no-erasees-mega gay !

134
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,288
what's all this
fighting about, children ?

135
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,155
these guys are
trying to say

136
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,457
they're gayer
than us !

137
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,059
oh no, don't tell me
you children

138
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,662
have taken up this whole
metrosexual fad too !

139
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,963
oh my god !

140
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,698
this is not a fad,
this is who we are.

141
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,000
no, it isn't !

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,735
last year you children
were all trying to be black,

143
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,470
now you're all
trying to be gay !

144
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,205
we're metrosexual !

145
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,940
maybe, but you'll never be
as metrosexual as us !

146
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,675
come on, fags !

147
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,976

148
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,711

gah !

149
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,446
chef ?

150
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,615
i don't feel
very metrosexual.

151
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,218
well then, don't buy
into this fad, kyle.

152
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,688
be who you are,
not what's cool.

153
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,423
( bell rings )

154
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,158
all right, children,
let's take our seats.

155
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,496

doing ?

160
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,207
i didn't feel comfortable
in that stuff, dude.

161
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,509
i'm just being me.

162
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,810

163
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,111

164
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:12,979
we're not straight,
you're straight !

165
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,280
you're straight !

166
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,581

167
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,883
what the hell

168
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,052
you wish you were gay,
craig, in your dreams !

169
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,522
i'm not just gay,
i'm a catamite !

170
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,691
so, i'm half
bisexual !

171
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,992
oh, stop it !

172
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,727
you kids don't even know
what you're talking about !

173
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,462
eric, you're not
half bi !

174
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,763
i'm like,
a quarter bi.

175
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,065
my grandpa was bi,

176
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,366
so that makes me
quarter bi !

177
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,101
what ?!

178
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,704
it was the craziest thing
i've ever seen, mr. slave.

179
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,872
all the children were
suddenly acting like

180
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,607
being gay was cool.

181
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,343
i mean, maybe
we're not the only

182
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,511
gay couple in town anymore.

183
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,680
oh, jesus christ.

184
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,283
( thumping dance music )

185
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,753
look at that,
mr. slave !

186
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,789
our cup runneth over.

187
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,091
jesus christ !

188
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,826
mr. garrison,
those are great pants.

189
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,428
thanks, jimbo, i really
like your outfit too.

190
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,163
so, so, jimbo,

191
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,332
you wanna come back
to my place

192
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,067
with me and mr. slave ?

193
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,802
uh, for what ?

194
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,405
well, you know...

195
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,272
no.

196
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,574
huh.

197
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,309
mr. garrison !
hey, doll !

198
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,610
oh, hey, randy.

199
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,345
you're looking
ultra fabulous.

200
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,080
thanks, you too.

201
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,815
so, uh, randy,

202
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,285
you want me to give you
a hand job in the bathroom ?

203
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,888
no, no thanks,
i'm not like that.

204
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,057
not like that ?

205
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,792
how about some
shiraz, guys ?

206
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,527
oh, thanks, mr. tweek.

207
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,262
my pleasure,
silly buns.

208
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,563
oh...

209
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,166
well, mr. tweek, why don't we
go back to my place ?

210
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,901
why ?

211
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,202
well, you know,
i was just thinking

212
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,805
we could put on some music
and watch videos

213
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,408
and pound mr. slave's
tight little ass.

214
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,143
ooh, jesus christ.

215
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,311
oh, goodness no,
i'm straight.

216
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,046
straight ?

217
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,083
oh, what-- just what the hell
is going on here ?!

218
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,119
why won't anybody pound
mr. slave's butt ?

219
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,854
well, we don't
pound butt, mr. garrison,

220
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,589
we're straight.

221
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,192
those pants and those shoes
sayyoupound butt !

222
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,927
hey, now,
that's not true.

223
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,662
my shoes don't say
i pound butt.

224
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,265
no, your shoes say you
take it in the butt !

225
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,000
it's okay, mr. garrison,

226
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,735
we've learned that gays
are totally cool.

227
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,470
you're just
one of us now !

228
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,771
( all )
yeah !

229
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,506
one of you ?!

230
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,109
we spend our whole lives
trying to not be one of you !

231
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,711
you can't do this to us !

232
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,447
have you guys
seen this ?

233
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,748
it's a conditioner
that you can leave in

234
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,917
and it detoxifies
the scalp.

235
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,218
wow, is that
fromorigins?

236
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,519
yeah, it's a charcoal
based thing that--

237
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,556
hey, guys, you wanna go
throw the football around ?

238
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,724
guys, can i talk to you
over here for a second ?

239
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:43,062
look guys, a lot of the kids
in school are talking, okay ?

240
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,231
and they're spreading rumors
that we're not metrosexuals

241
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,966
because we hang out
with kyle.

242
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,267
well, what can we
do about it ?

243
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,569
we have no choice,
you guys.

244
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,737
we're just gonna
have to kill kyle.

245
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,039
what, that's stupid !

246
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,340
we wouldn't
have to kill kyle.

247
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,509
we would just have to tell him
not to hang around us anymore !

248
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,244
oh, you know,
you're right, stan.

249
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,979
we just have to tell kyle
not to hang around us anymore.

250
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,280
yeah-- wait, what ?

251
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,582
you hear that, kenny ?

252
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,317
stan thinks we should tell kyle
not to hang around us anymore.

253
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,618
i think he's right.

254
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,919
good luck
telling him, stan,

255
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,221
i know it won't
be easy.

256
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,088
hey, butch boy !

257
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,823
nice football
you got there !

258
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,124
( laughter )

259
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,860
when was the last time
you had a manicure,

260
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,161
straight man ?

261
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,896
yeah, let's see
that hair.

262
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,499
look, he's not even
using any product !

263
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,234
hey, what's going on ?

264
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,969
oh, here come
the butch boys

265
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,439
to help their
butchy little friend.

266
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,475
he's not our friend.

267
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,813
stan ?

268
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,584
this playground is for
metrosexuals, macho man !

269
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,753
take your non-flaming ass
to some other school !

270
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,922
no-- ah--

271
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,365
kyle !

272
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,100
what happened to you ?

273
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,136
i got beat up at school--
for being different.

274
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,437
what ?!

275
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,172
your classmates beat you up
for being a jew ?

276
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,474
no !

277
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,775
for not being
a metrosexual !

278
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,076
gerald !

279
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,378
gerald, get down here !

280
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:06,679
heeere i come !

281
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,715
( dance music )

282
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,523
oh, no, dad's
metrosexual too ?

283
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,692
kyle !
you look terrible !

284
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,427
the boys at school
beat him up, gerald !

285
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,728
oh, really ?

286
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,463
well, don't you worry, kyle.

287
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,632
we can cover that black eye up
with some cream base,

288
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,801
and the coat and pants
we'll bleach with an acid wash

289
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,102
for a fun, vintage look.

290
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,705
aaagh !
just leave me alone !

291
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,440
( dance music
coming from tv )

292
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,741
( man )
there you go !

293
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,043
now you look
fabulous !

294
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,344
you see that ?

295
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,645
a spray-on tan does
wonders for your look !

296
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,947
grrrrrrr !

297
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,248
now, let's get down to
the tango class

298
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,549
and learn some new steps.

299
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,417
that does it !

300
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,586
i know what
i have to do !

301
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,754
( doorbell rings )

302
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,056
oh, hello, mr. garrison.

303
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,224
chef, can i talk to you ?

304
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,960
sure, come on in.

305
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,827
thanks.

306
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,863
come, slave.

307
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,466
it's just awful, chef.

308
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,069
i used to feel like
an outsider,

309
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,671
a totally different person
who stood out in this town.

310
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,708
now every straight guy
is acting gayer than me !

311
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,310
oh, jesus,
jesus christ !

312
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,045
well, what do you
want me to do about it ?

313
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,515
chef, what did you do when white
people stole your culture ?

314
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,817
oh.

315
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,118
well, we black people just
always tried to stay

316
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,853
out in front of them.

317
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,154
how did you do that ?

318
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,456
well, like with our slang.

319
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,625
black people always used to
say "i'm in the house"

320
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,926
instead of "i'm here".

321
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,661
but then white people all
started to say "in the house"

322
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,396
so we switched it to
"in the hisouse".

323
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,131
"hisouse" became "hisisouse".

324
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,866
and when white folk
started sayingthat

325
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,469
and we had to change it to
"heezay", then "in the hizzle",

326
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,204
which we had to change to
"hizzle for zizzle"

327
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,806
and now because white people
say "hizzle for zizzle"

328
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,409
we have to say "flippity
floppity floop".

329
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,313
we don't have time
for all that, chef !

330
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,048
oh, if only those "queer eye
for the straight guy" people

331
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,651
understood what
they were doing.

332
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,952
wait, that's it !

333
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,121
i know exactly
what to do !

334
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:55,988
come on, mr. slave,

335
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,157
let's get back to our
flippity floppity floop !

336
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,458
oh, no !

337
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,061
dammit,
don't call it that !

338
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,664
one ticket to
new york, please.

339
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,832
you're going to
new york alone ?

340
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,001
i'm going to see the "queer eye
for the straight guy" people.

341
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,302
ooh, great idea !

342
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,471
they can help you with
those dated clothes.

343
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,087
mr. garrison ?

344
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,388
kyle, what are you
doing here ?

345
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,690
i'm going to new york

346
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,425
to kill the "queer eye for
the straight guy" people.

347
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,160
what ?!
that's what i'm doing !

348
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,461
oh, no,
they ruined my life--

349
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,762
i get to kill them first !

350
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,497
they took gay culture
from real gays

351
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,232
and their asses are ours !

352
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,100
i thought of it first !

353
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,401
no you didn't !
no you didn't !

354

355
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,570
i thought of it
yesterday !

356
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,871
i thought of it
two days ago !

357
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,739
i thought of it
before you were born !

358
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,474
stop it, you two,
stop it !

359
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,643
don't you see
how crazy this is ?

360
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,245
oh, you're right,
mr. slave.

361
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,414
we can both
kill them together.

362
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,017
cool.

363
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,752
wow, we look great !

364
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,487
yeah, let's see
craig out-gay us now !

365
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,222
boys, boys,
come on !

366
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,258
there's a sale down
atexpress for men!

367
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:10,162
hey, guys, there's a sale
at express for men !

368
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,331
oh my god !
let's go !

369
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,934
you guys have got to see
these shoes i bought !

370
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,536
hurry, you guys, the mall
closes in seven hours !

371
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,006
oh, why can't we all
live at the mall ?

372
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,308
you know, i'm starting
to think

373
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,344
this whole metrosexual thing
isn't so great.

374
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,645
i know what you mean.

375
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:27,947
all my husband
ever does now

376
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,682
is look at himself
in the mirror.

377
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,284
he cares more about how
he looks than how i look.

378
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:37,056
i hope something happens soon to
put an end to this whole fad.

379
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,225
guys, you've done
a terrific job !

380
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,526
"queer eye for the
straight guy"

381
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,562
is our number one show !

382
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,165

we're fabulous !

383
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,334

386
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,840
oh my god, i think
i'm gonna faint !

387
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,009
( knock at door )

388
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,744
( mr. garrison )
room service.

389
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,479
what ?  we didn't order
any room service.

390
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,949
oh, well, the woman at
the front desk sent it up.

391
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,251
carol ?

392
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,721
i'll have to check on this,
excuse me a minute, fellas.

393
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,058
clear !

394
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,794
okay, mr. slave !

395
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,734
uh, jesus... christ.

396
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,638
well, crap,
that didn't work.

397
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,939
you better
shut up, craig !

398
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,240
everyone knows
it's true !

399
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,542
it is not !

400
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,843

401
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:31,710
craig !
behave yourself !

402
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,879
yeah, stanley what are you
fighting about ?

403
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,048
dad, craig's trying to say that
his dad can out-dress you !

404
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,349
what ?

405
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,084
son, that's a silly thing
to fight about.

406
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,687
yeah, everyone already knows
i dress better than randy.

407
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:42,988
oh really ?!

408
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,025
i mean, you do have the fashion
sense of a japanese woman.

409
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,326
( guys )
oooh !

410
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,627
please, girlfriend,

411
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,796
you look like some kind of
little orphan annie nightmare.

412
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,965
oh, no-- burn !

413
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,700
oh, stop it !

414
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,435
will you all
just stop it ?

415
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,038
look, you guys are
carrying this fad too far,

416
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,773
will you please stop
acting this way ?

417
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,110
you don't like us
being metrosexual ?

418
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,412
no !

419
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,014
well, you know
what i think ?

420
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,183
i think you're all
metrophobic !

421
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,484
yeah ! yeah !

422
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,786
what ?

423
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,087
we shouldn't be fighting
amongst ourselves,

424
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,256
we should be uniting against
metrophobes like these !

425
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,557
this is crazy !

426
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,594
crazy, different,
outcasts...

427
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,329
call us what you want,

428
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,931
but us metros are real
people, just like you.

429
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,401
you can metro-bash us all you
want, but we're here to stay !

430
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,570
yeah, mom, we're proud
of who we are.

431
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,872
that's right, proud !

432
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,173
you know what
i think, guys ?

433
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,342
i think we should have a
metrosexual pride parade.

434
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,944
great idea, eric--
raise metrosexual awareness !

435
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,679
we can make floats
and decorate them

436
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:41,981
with streamers
and flowers !

437
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,282
woo-hoo !

438
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,583
come on, fellas !

439
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,885
out of the malls
and into the streets !

440
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,053
( men chanting )
out of the malls
and into the streets !

441
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,788
out of the malls and
into the streets...

442
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,825
what the hell did
that show do to them ?

443
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,861
you sure you don't
want to press charges ?

444
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:56,729
that's okay, officer,

445
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,898
i think they learned
murder is wrong.

446
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,633
especially inthosepants.

447
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,669
look, guys, we're sorry
we tried to murder you,

448
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,838
but you have to stop
what you're doing !

449
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,139
are you crazy ?

450
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,874
we're the hottest thing
on tv !

451
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,609
but don't you see the price ?

452
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,778
you're selling out
your own kind.

453
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,947
look, us gays have
created a lifestyle,

454
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,549
a culture that is
uniquely ours.

455
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,718
if we keep trying to make
straight people into us,

456
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,755
well, we're gonna have
no identity left.

457
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,394
sorry charlie,
no sale.

458
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,864
but... but...
this doesn't make sense !

459
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,334
how can gay men do this
to their own people ?!

460
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,672
unless... you're not
gay at all.

461
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,877
( deep voices )
you just had to push it,
didn't you ?

462
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,781
just had to keep
asking questions.

463
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,817
now you know the truth.

464
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,685
they aren't gay ?

465
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,420
then what are they ?

466
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,721
for a thousand years

467
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,890
our kind have lived
beneath the earth's crust,

468
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,059
banished by man
in the kindling wars.

469
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,529
oh my god.

470
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,469
we are
the crab people !

471
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,770
aaaah !

472
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,505
jesus christ !

473
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,240
( chanting )
crab people...

474
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,409
crab people, crab people...

475
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,825
( chanting )
crab people, crab people...

476
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,729
see now, where we have been
forced to live

477
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,464
for a thousand years !

478
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,632
but soon, we shall
rule the land above

479
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,801
and mankind
will be gone !

480
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,536
gone ?!

481
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,440
crab people, crab people...

482
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,344
crab people are too small and
weak to take man over by force,

483
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,248
and so we came up with
our perfect plan.

484
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:03,622
if you can't beat man--
change man !

485
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,923
i knew it.

486
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,526
i knew gay people would never
do this to their own kind !

487
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,695
when all the world
is metrosexual

488
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,165
the crab people shall
finally reign supreme !

489
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:17,069
crab people, crab people...

490
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,539
taste like crab,
talk like people.

491
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,142
crab people...

492
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,744
you'll never turn me
into a metrosexual !

493
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,347
i like being a dirty,
filthy little boy !

494
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,648
very well !

495
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,817
if we can't make you
into metrosexuals

496
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,287
then we will make you
into crab people !

497
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,890
take them !

where the first annual
metrosexual pride parade

509
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,085
is under way !

510
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,687
( cheering )

511
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,856
we're here !
we're not queer !

512
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,025
but we're close !
get used to it !

513
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,326
we're here !
we're not queer !

514
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,061
but we're close...

515
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,664
this does it !
i can't take it anymore !

516
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,965
i should have
never wished for

517
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,700
a cleaner,
neater husband !

518
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,001
ladies, get your things.

519
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,170
i know what
we have to do.

520
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,243
whoa, look out !

521
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,279
oh my god !
it's on fire !

522
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,014
put it out !
put it out !

523
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,617
i can't do anything--
these are brand-new pants !

524
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,352
the heat could really
damage our hair !

525
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,087
we better let the police
handle this !

526
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,388
are you crazy ?

527
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,124
i just had my
uniform pressed !

528
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,859
oh jesus, it's burning !

529
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,594
put it out !
put it out !

530
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,630
jesus !
fire !

531
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,534
mr. president, it is such
an honor to make you over !

532
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,703
now, we've got to do
something with your hair.

533
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,872
and your nails are filthy,
let's get those clean.

534
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,040
this is gay gold !

535
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,077
stop them !
they're crab people !

536
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,246
they cannot see or
hear us, foolish man !

537
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,981
now stand by and watch

538
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,583
as your pitiful race
becomes helpless !

539
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,318
that is very good,
mr. president !

540
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,355
now, put on this
silk jacket.

541
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,656
no, mr. president,
don't do it !

542
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,957
help !

543
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,259
you bastards.

544
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:21,560
that looks great !

545
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,729
now, how about
some moisturizer.

546
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,331
there they are !
get 'em !

547
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,633
what ?

548
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,801
you turned our husbands into
whiny little wusses !

549
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,838
it's payback time !

550
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,043
oh my god !
what are they doing ?

551
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,778
no, nooo !

552
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,718
wha-- what have you done ?

553
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,887
we're sorry, but we didn't
have a choice.

554
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,056
you see, at first we liked
having our men

555
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,791
be clean and neat.

556
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,960
we thought that having them
use product in their hair

557
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,695
and wanting facials
would make them sexier.

558
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,430
but it doesn't.

559
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,033
that's right, even though my
stephen sicks me out sometimes,

560
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,503
it's his rugged, manly grossness
that i'm attracted to.

561
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,672
we're sorry, but we knew
the only answer

562
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,840
was to kill the
queer eye guys.

563
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,009
well, you're going to
jail for the--

564
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,046
wait a minute--
what is that ?

565
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,215
no, our evil plans.

566
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,685
nooo...

567
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,420
oh my god.

568
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,155
they were crab people.

569
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,456
yes !

570
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,191
they were trying to
systematically

571
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,360
make men into wusses so they
could take over the world !

572
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,095
mom !
kyle !

573
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,264
i should have known
they were crab people.

574
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,433
they tried this before
with "the jeffersons".

575
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,469
so now can you please change
your network's programming ?

576
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,770
yes.

577
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,505
yes, i think this
gay fad is over.

578
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,241
gentlemen,
back to studio 12.

579
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,277
we're gonna bring back
the latin fad !

580
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,482

581
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,952

582
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,422

hey, ese, you wanna come
play catch with us ?

584
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,326
what ?

585
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,628
you want me to
hang out with you ?

586
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,796
yeah, it's cool, holmes.

587
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,531
no, dude,
it really isn't cool.

588
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,700
you all turned
your backs on me.

589
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,869
you're supposed to be my
best friends and you just,

590
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,170
you treated me
like nothing.

591
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,472
and now you all expect me
to just forget it all

592
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,074
and hang out with you again
like nothing happened ?

593
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,243
oh jesus, kyle, don't be such
a whiny little gay-wad.

594
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,544
come play catch
with us.

595
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,713
yeah, don't be
such a fag, dude !

596
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,425
