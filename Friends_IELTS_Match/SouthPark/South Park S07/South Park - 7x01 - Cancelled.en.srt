00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,176

to school with me !

21
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,477
yeah, go home,
you little dildo !

22
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,646
dude, for the last time,
don't call my brother a dildo !

23
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,249
alright, go home you little
semen-puking, asshole dickhead.

24
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,550
ow !

25
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,285
dude, sweet !

26
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,586
yeah, check it out.

27
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,321
ready, ike ?
kick the baby !

28
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,924
don't kick
the god damn baby.

29
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,659
wah-- ah !

30
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:00,960
woah, cartman,

31
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,695
looks like you didn't
get much sleep last night.

32
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:03,997
that's because
i was having these

33
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,732
bogus nightmares
all night long.

34
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,033
really ?
what about ?

35
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,636
well, i dreamt that i was
lying in my bed, in the dark...

36
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,106
when all of a sudden this bright
blue light filled the room.

37
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,708
and slowly, my bedroom door
began to open.

38
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,010
and then the next thing
i remember

39
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:18,745
i was being drug
through a hallway !

40
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,046
weeee !

41
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,215
then these scary aliens
wanted to operate on me !

42
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,251
they had big heads
and big black eyes--

43
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,553
dude, visitors !
totally !

44
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,854
what ?

45
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,155
that wasn't a dream, cartman,
those were visitors !

46
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,457
no, it was just a dream,
my mom said so.

47
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,192
visitors are real !
they--

48
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,228
wait a minute, this has
all happened before.

49
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,963
yeah. this does seem
really familiar.

50
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,132
what thefunk and wagnalls
are you talking about ?

51
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,734
cartman, don't you remember the
last time you had this dream ?

52
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,903
shut up you guys, you're just
trying to scare me.

53
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,638
no, dude,
this happened before !

54
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,940
aliens put some device in you,

55
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,675
and then we tied you to a tree
and you went up on their ship.

56
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,542
you don't remember that ?

57
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,844
no, i don't
remember that !

58
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,145
you don't ?

59
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,446
no, because the aliens
erased my memory !

60
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,615
i remember this whole thing.

61
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,350
ike tried to follow you
to school, you kicked him,

62
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,085
then cartman told us
about his alien dream.

63
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,688
yeah, and then chef
pulled up in his car.

64
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,290
hello there, children !

65
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,327
and then you said--

66
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,496
what's gonna be for
lunch today, chef ?

67
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,098
well, today it's salisbury steak
with hot buttered noodles

68
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,399
( all )
and a choice of
green bean salad

69
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,135
or vegetable medley.

70
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,002
weird.

71
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,303
say, did any of you
children--

72
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,605
see the alien spaceship
last night ?

73
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,340
what the-- ?

74
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,509
chef, we're
in a repeat !

75
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,376
a repeat ?

76
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,111
cartman was visited by
aliens again last night.

77
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,714
and now it's like we're living
a repeat of a previous day.

78
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,015
oh, dude, i hate repeats.

79
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,618
i've been feeling deja vu
all morning, children.

80
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,786
i knew something strange
was going on.

81
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,522
it all started when cartman
got an anal probe.

82
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,992
we have to get eric to a
proctologist right away.

83
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,329
what is a
proc-tologist, chef ?

84
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,932
he's a doctor that specializes
in your asshole, children.

85
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,667
you mean at some point
in this doctor's life

86
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,402
he decided he wanted to
work on people's buttholes ?

87
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,703
that's right.

88
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,005
what a dick.

89
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,306
hello, everyone.

90
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,607
hello, doctor.

91
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,909
thanks for seeing eric
on such short notice.

92
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,210
what seems to be
the problem ?

93
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,511
we just want you
to take a look

94
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,246
and tell us if you see
anything abnormal.

95
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,548
other than its
monstrous size.

96
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,584
shut up !  shut your
god damn mouth !!

97
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,753
alright, let's see here...

98
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,488
oh my god !

99
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,789
what ?

100
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,524
why there's a huge crack going
right down the middle !

101
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,561
ha, ha, very funny.

102
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,729
like we haven't heard
that one a zillion times.

103
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,898
alright,
let's take a look.

104
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,633
hey !

105
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,368
just what the hell do you
think you're doing ?

106
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,971
eric, the doctor has to feel
inside your rectum.

107
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,838
and afterwards,

108
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,574
he'll probably have to
burn his hand and bury it.

109
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,309
kyle, i swear if i didn't
have a guy's hand up
my ass right now,

110
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,477
i'd leap across the room
and kick you in the nuts.

111
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,948
egh, eh-- ooh.

112
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,683
the prostate
seems to be normal...

113
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,418
no swelling of
the hermodal gland...

114
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,587
wait, what's this ?

115
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,888
aaagh !

116
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,226
are you okay ?

117
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,527
dude...

118
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,129
you know that feeling
when you take a huge dump ?

119
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:50,997
awesome.

120
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,298
well, doctor ?

121
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,467
i've never quite
seen this before.

122
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,070
perhaps he just needs
some hemorrhoid cream.

123
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,672
aaagh !

124
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,974
you alright ?

125
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,709
you know that feeling when
the huge dump you just took

126
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,444
shoots back up
inside your ass ?

127
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,745
no, i'm not alright !!

128
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,914
i've never seen
a hemorrhoid
react this way.

129
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,950
that wasn't no hemorrhoid,
it was a alien hoop-a-joo !

130
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,987
come on, children, we've got to
get eric to some real help !

131
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,288
where to now, chef ?

132
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,155
that thing inside
eric's asshole

133
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,890
looked like some kind of
alien satellite dish.

134
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,361
we need to see my friend down
at the space center, now !

135
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,205
and you're the only person
i could think of

136
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,940
who might be able
to help us, jeff.

137
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,675
how do we, uh,
make it come out ?

138
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,844
someone just has to activate it
like the proctologist did.

139
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,145
oh, no, no, no, no !

140
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,748
nobody is putting their
finger in my ass again !

141
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,483
unless it's kyle.

142
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,218
what ?
no way !

143
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,085
you do it, kenny.

144
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,387
nope, it has to
be kyle.

145
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,688
go on.

146
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,989
i'm not putting my finger
up cartman's butt !

147
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,026
kyle, the fate of the world
may be at stake.

148
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,628
come, kyle,
do hurry.

149
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,267
go ahead,
it won't bite.

150
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,568
( farts )

151
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,171
god damn it, cartman !

152
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,207
i couldn't resist,
i'm sorry.

153
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,075
( farts )

154
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,244
stop it, cartman !

155
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,979
okay, okay.

156
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,280
( farts )

157
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,449
god dammit !

158
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,052
man, that was great.

159
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,654
okay, go ahead,
i'm all out of farts now.

160
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,955
( farts )

161
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,691
durrrr !

162
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,594
okay, okay,
it's not funny anymore.

163
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,896
( farts )

164
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,065
oh, yes it is !

165
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,366
eric, that's enough !

166
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,968
okay, okay.

167
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,270
( farts )

168
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,005
oh, double psyche !

169
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,740
that's it !

170
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,475
i don't care about
the fate of the world.

171
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,343
screw it !

172
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,644
oh, nice going,
cartman !

173
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,511
alright, alright,
i'm sorry.

174
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:46,813
go ahead, kyle.

175
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,680
no !

176
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,548
no, go ahead,
i'm dry.

177
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,415
you're lying !

178
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,150
it stopped being funny
40 seconds ago, boys.

179
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,452
let's just get this
over with.

180
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,620
but itwasone of the
best times i've ever had.

181
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,356
can i see this thing,
please ?

182
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,091
okay.

183
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,259
( farts )

184
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,862
okay, now it's
funny again.

185
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,163
this is so awesome !

186
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,465
i don't think i made it

187
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,332
out of that proctologist's's
office, guys,

188
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,633
i think i died
and went to heaven !

189
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,501
that does it !

190
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,369
charrrge !

191
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,670
( fart )

192
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,537
aagh !

193
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,176
what's it doing ?

194
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,779
it's sending a transmission
of some kind.

195
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,249
got it.

196
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,719
it's just sending images of
cities and people and stuff.

197
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,454
where is the signal
being sent to ?

198
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,491
ugh, agh !

199
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,395
i don't wanna play
anymore, you guys.

200
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,563
we went through all that just
for some gay video of earth ?

201
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,732
we wanted to see an alien
planet or something !

202
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,901
whoever they are, if they're
receiving messages

203
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,070
they might be
sending them too.

204
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,805
wait a minute.
c-candy bars !

205
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,540
candy bars ?

206
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,143
y'know, candy bars, they
usually come in a wrapper,

207
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,311
just like you wrap
a christmas present.

208
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,046
christmas happens
when it's cold.

209
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,782
cold as in alaska.

210
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,384
that's polar bears,
polar bears...

211
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,119
polarity !

212
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,288
i can switch the polarity
to see what transmissions

213
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,758
are coming from the location
this one is being sent to !

214
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,963
what the heck ?

215
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,904
they're coming in !

216
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,844
what do we do ?

217
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,145
it's that guy you want !

218
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,880
he's trying to reverse
your polarities !

219
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,182
what ?

220
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,350
run !

221
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,519
get in the car, children,
get in the car !

222
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,724
( honking )

223
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,592
what is that ?

224
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,327
can you see anything,
children ?

225
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,930
the aliens
are chasing us !

226
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,737
god damn aliens !

227
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,641
chef, end of the road !

228
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,111
hold on, children !
we have to ditch them !

229
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,847
what are you doing, man ?

230
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,750
( "dukes" narrator )
looks like them boys are
getting a little fresh air.

231
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:09,088
( country music )

232
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,293
i think we ditched 'em.

233
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,896
i don't think we're
out of the woods yet.

234
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,234
coop coop !

235
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,535
it's the police !

236
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,270
that ain't no police !

237
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,644
when do we get to eat ?
i'm hungry.

238
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,379
chef !

239
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,548
ohh !

240
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,150
( "general lee" horn )

241
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,260
ha !  god damn aliens !

242
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,561

243
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,730
where'd you learn
to drive, aliens ?

244
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,465
chinese auto school ?

245
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,200
chef !
chef, help !

246
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,501
you're lucky i didn't
just turn around

247
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,538
and beat your white
skinny alien asses anyway !

248
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,140
maybe next time
you'll remember to-- huh ?

249
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,176
aw, crap !

250
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,478
children !

251
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,647
( all )
cheffff !

252
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,382
well, it looks like the boys
are in more trouble

253
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,683
than a june bug
in molasses.

254
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,418
and it's pretty thick
molasses, too.

255
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,325
uh...

256
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,494
you guys,
wake up !

257
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,096
what the--
where are we ?

258
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,699
we're in the
alien ship.

259
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,000
ah, ah !

260
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,735
ugh, i'm trapped inside
helen hunt's ass !

261
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,037
oh god, help me,
you guys !

262
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,338
it's not
helen hunt's ass !

263
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,639
it's an alien spaceship.

264
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,109
oh, thank god !
oh thank, thank you lord.

265
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,278
you guys, look.

266
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,881
wow.
wow.

267
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,520
my god,
do you guys realize ?

268
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,122
this is only the second time
we've ever been in outer space.

269
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:50,990
yeah.

270
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,725
awesome.

271
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,894
this is like
my fifth time.

272
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,099
uh-oh.

273
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,400
this must be
the head alien guy.

274
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,135
oh, no !

275
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,738
hello, boys.

276
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,039
dad ?

277
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,208
no, not really.

278
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,509
i just read your mind
and thought this form

279
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,112
might be more
pleasing to you.

280
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,847
oh dude, don't do that,
that's gay.

281
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,148
yeah, that's like that
stupid movie "contact".

282
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,883
oh god, that movie
pissed me off.

283
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:21,354
very well, i shall
show my true form--

284
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,655
blargh, blargh,
blargh !

285
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,390
okay, okay, take the form
of something else !

286
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,125
how's this ?

287
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,860
santa !

288
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,161
no, that's stupid too.

289
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,896
how about this ?

290
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,632
( all )
no.

291
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,234
no.

292
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,837
ooh, very nice.

293
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,138
no.

294
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,873
no.

295
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,042
dy-no-mite !

296
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,343
( all )
no !

297
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,813
jeff !

298
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,548
the aliens took the children
up on their ship !

299
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,416
oh, no !

300
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,151
did you find out what
the aliens are up to ?

301
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,452
when i reversed the polarities
i found this--

302
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,356
it's a message that
the aliens are broadcasting

303
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,658
throughout the
entire universe.

304
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,393
but i have no idea
what it says.

305
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,694
they took the children, jeff !

306
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,863
i have to know what
those aliens are up to !

307
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,465
wait a minute--
butt sex.

308
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,767
butt sex ?

309
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,935
butt sex requires a lot of
lubrication, right ?

310
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,406
lubrication...
lubra, chupa...

311
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,008
chupacabras, the goat
killer of mexican folklore.

312
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,177
folklore is stories
from the past

313
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,912
that are often
fictionalized,

314
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,515
fictionalized to heighten
drama, drama student !

315
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,250
students at colleges
usually have bicycles.

316
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,852
bi, bi-binary !
it's binary code !

317
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,021
who's having butt sex ?

318
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,058
? hello my honey
hello my baby ?

319
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,226
? hello my
rag time gal ?

320
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,528
no !

321
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,865
? let me search it
gonna work it... ?

322
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,167
no !

323
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,769
? don't piss on
the moon, babe ?

324
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,071
no !

325
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,541
alright, earthlings, what form
do you want me to take ?

326
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,577
how about a taco--
that craps ice cream ?

327
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,650
guys ?

328
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,517
i like it.

329
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,252
me too.

330
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,421
alright, then we can
get back to business.

331
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,590
follow me this way,
earthlings.

332
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,928
i want to apologize
to you boys

333
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,663
for all the spooky,
scary stuff.

334
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,265
we just needed to get to the
malfunctioning uplink relay.

335
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,567
you mean the thing
in cartman's ass ?

336
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,868
that's right.

337
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,037
see, there are dishes in over
50,000 earthlings' rectums,

338
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,772
your friend's
has been malfunctioning.

339
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,073
why do you put them
into people's asses ?

340
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,242
are you planning some
kind of alien take over ?

341
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,543
oh, heaven's no !

342
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,845
we're a production company.

343
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,580
we make intergalactic
television programs

344
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,749
that the whole
universe watches.

345
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,917
television ?

346
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,520
we at nerzod productions
started 20 billion years ago

347
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,821
with one philosophy:

348
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,858
the best universal television
isn't scripted, it's real !

349
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,593
we started with
great shows like

350
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,328
"who wants to
marry a gelgamek ?"

351
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,063
and "antares 6
millionaire".

352
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,364
and then we had
a big hit with

353
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,099
"get me outta here,
i'm a klignanian".

354
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,268
but then, of course,
there's our signature show,

355
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,738
the greatest universal
reality show of all time.

356
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,811
earth ?

357
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,546
a few billion years ago
we realized--

358
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,149
what if we took species
from all different planets
in the universe

359
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,185
and put them together
on the same planet ?

360
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,486
great tv, right ?

361
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,089
asians, bears, ducks,
jews, deer and hispanics

362
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,258
all trying to live
side by side on one planet !

363
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,559
it's great !

364
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,595
our planet is just
a reality tv show ?

365
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,897
well, you don't think
the whole universe

366
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,632
works the way earth
does, do you ?

367
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,367
no !  one species,
one planet.

368
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,969
there's a planet of deer,
a planet of asians and so on.

369
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,704
we put them all together
on earth

370
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,439
and the whole universe
tunes in to watch the fun !

371
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,910
you mean that you aliens
actually enjoy sitting around

372
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,645
and watching us fight
and kill with each other ?

373
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,946
dude, that's messed up.

374
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,247
why ?

375
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,549
why !  because you're playing
with people's lives !

376
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,284
you're turning people's problems
into entertainment !

377
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,320
yeah, we'd never
do that on earth !

378
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,224
ladies and gentlemen.

379
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,393
we have recently come across
an alien transmission

380
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,429
that is being beamed throughout
the entire universe.

381
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,598
( audience murmuring )

382
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,201
when decoded,
it looks like this.

383
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,647
what does it mean ?

384
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,949
it's simple
mathematical language

385
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,117
that can be understood
throughout the solar system.

386
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,588
translated into our language,
it looks like this.

387
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,756
( announcer )
this janamon at 8:00

388
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,491
it's everyone's
favorite show--

389
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,793
earth !

390
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,395
it's been 100 galgamars
since we first took species

391
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,697
from 17 different planets

392
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,299
and put them all together
on the same planet !

393
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,203
they've fought
and fallen in love.

394
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,938
what will happen
this galgamar ?

395
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,673
tune in janamon at eight
to find out !

396
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,143
it's earth, onfognl !

397
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:44,216
i'm afraid that earth,
all of earth,

398
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:49,421
is nothing but an intergalactic
reality tv show.

399
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,590
my god.

400
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:52,892
we're famous !

401
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,494
( cheering )

402
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,663
wait, you don't
understand.

403
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,398
i'm on tv !
i'm on tv !

404
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,001
oh, this is so awesome !

405
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,676
that should get the relay
working again.

406
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,411
alright, earthlings,
if you'll step over this way

407
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,014
we'll erase your memories
and get you back to earth.

408
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,749
( phone rings )
oh, excuse me.

409
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,050
this is najix.

410
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,351
uh-huh.

411
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,086
oh, no.

412
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,821
oh, no, really ?

413
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,424
it's for sure ?

414
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,593
alright, i'll break
the news to everyone.

415
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,195
no, no, i understand,
thanks.

416
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,364
well, you kids can go
back to earth if you want

417
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,099
but i'm afraid it won't
be there for long.

418
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,401
the show's been canceled.

419
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,136
what ?
who canceled us ?

420
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,437
the universal
network heads.

421
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,738
they say the earthlings have
become aware of the show

422
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,907
so it won't be
funny anymore.

423
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,208
oh ( bleep ),
did we do that ?

424
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,944
everyone, can i have your
attention real quick ?

425
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,679
uh, look, i just got a call
from the network

426
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,847
and i'm afraid earth
has been canceled.

427
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,149
( all )
aww...

428
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,884
now, now,
it was a great run

429
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,486
and i think we should all
be really proud.

430
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,655
( slight applause )

431
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,523
let's call in
the demolition crew

432
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,258
to strike the earth
for resources.

433
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,559
wait, wait !
they can't do this !

434
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,860
let us talk to
the network heads !

435
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,162
wouldn't do any good.

436
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,463
dude, we have to try !

437
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,198
please take us to them,
please !

438
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,367
alright, kids, we'll take you
to the network heads,

439
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,536
but i warn you,
nobody has ever gotten

440
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,705
the executives
to un-cancel a show

441
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,006
once the call
has been made.

442
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,741
nobody.

443
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,553
( beeping )

444
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,867
what the hell is that ?

445
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,168
there's a huge ship of some kind
in earth's orbit.

446
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,337
but why ?

447
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,072
wait a minute--
chaos theory !

448
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,374
chaos theory ?

449
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,542
chaos theory, it was first
thought of in the '60s, 60.

450
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,013
that's the number of episodes
they made of "punky brewster"

451
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,181
before it was canceled.
canceled ?

452
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,049
huh ?

453
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,218
don't you see ?
the show is over.

454
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,953
the aliens are
canceling earth !

455
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,254
oh my god.

456
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,857
we have to stop them !

457
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,327
( announcer )

home of the joozians,

458
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,664

in the universe !

00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:16,135

460
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,171
oh, uh, we have a 3:00 meeting
with the network heads.

461
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,340
where are you
visiting from ?

462
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,207
uh, earth.

463
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,509

465
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,111
( laughing )

466
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,413
oh sure, come on in,
earthlings !

467
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,148
we're just checking
our new show.

468
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,750
we took 100 beings from
the planet marklar

469
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,919
and put them on an asteroid
with sentient beings

470
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,220
from the horsehead nebula.

471
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,522
it's a riot !

472
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,690
they hate each other !

473
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,028
mighty, powerful
network executives.

474
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,197
we have come a great
distance in order to--

475
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,366
i'm starving, you earthlings
have haglar yet ?

476
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,667
oh yeah, let's do haglar.

477
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:49,968
where do you
want to go,moronis?

478
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,703
not on a fleckmar,
too crowded.

479
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,439
ooh !
blach-ga-felch !

480
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,174
oh, blach-ga-felch,
perfect !

481
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,644
this place is fantastic.

482
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,379
look, we just want to talk
to you about the show.

483
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,548
please don't cancel us,
please.

484
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,283
i'm sorry, earthlings,

485
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,885
but you have to realize
the universe is a business.

486
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,054
you made it to 100 episodes,
you should be proud.

487
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,657
yeah, a show should never
go past 100 episodes

488
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,392
or else it starts to get stale

489
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,994
with ridiculously stupid
plot lines and settings.

490
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,898
here's you order of glagaplatzl
for gnakleberg !

491
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,802
but, sirs, we think our show
is just getting good.

492
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,971
i mean, we're just now
starting to see people

493
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,706
getting really pissed off
at each other.

494
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,441
oh my god,
this is great !

495
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,176
you must have some
joozian ancestry.

496
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,478
tell us about it.

497
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,213
look, there's five billion
people on our show,

498
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,514
you can't just up and
cancel on us.

499
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,984
oh my god, will you look at the
hekmas on that joozimak ?

500
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,285
dude, we're trying to
save our planet here !

501
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,020
let's take the earthlings
to a hekma bar !

502
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,623
oh, yeah !

503
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,394
oh yeah, let's see
those hekmas !

504
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,696
sirs, if you'll--

505
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,298
oh, man,
i am so wasted.

506
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,901
hey, you earthlings wanna
try a little blancgh ?

507
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,504
( snorting )

508
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,974
oh, yeah !

509
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,709
oh, gluck yeah !

510
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,444
kenny !

511
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,179
man, screw this place !

512
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,914
let's go get a hotel room
and a hooker !

513
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,215
oh, yeah !

514
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,987
we have to find a way
to stop those aliens !

515
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,156
their ship is massive,
there's no way to stop it !

516
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,457
wait a minute--
jackets !

517
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,758
oh, no.

518
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,493
if people don't wear jackets
they could get cold !

519
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,963
a cold is caused by a virus,
a virus, a computer virus !

520
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,698
we could make
a computer virus

521
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,867
and send it to their ship
to disable their computers !

522
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,205
that doesn't make
any goddamn sense !

523
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,241
oh yeah, hooker,
oh yeah !

524
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,976
yeah, woo, yeah !

525
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,880
boy, earthlings, is this

00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,254
