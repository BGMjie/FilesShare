friends, we gather
in this place

16
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,441
to mourn the victims
of yesterday's tragedy.

17
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,477
nine good people, who were
run over in the street

18
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,080
by an elderly
woman driver.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,682
oh god, memorial services
are so boring.

20
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,851
you insensitive asshole,
cartman !

21
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,153
nine people died !

22
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,888
yeah, but like eight
of them were hippies.

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,623
mostly hippies go to
farmer's markets.

24
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,358
mostly.

25
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,527
it is sometimes hard,
in times like these,

26
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,262
to understand god's way.

27
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,997
why would he allow
nine innocent people

28
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,732
to be run down in the
prime of their lives

29
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,901
by a senior citizen who,
perhaps,

30
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,636
shouldn't be driving ?

31
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,937
it is then that
we must understand

32
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,973
god's sense of humor is very
different from our own.

33
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,010
he does not laugh at the simple
"man walks into a bar" joke.

34
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,347
no, god needs complex irony,
and subtle, farcical twists

35
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,516
that seem macabre
to you and me.

36
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,553
all that we can hope for, is
that god got his good laugh

37
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,589
and a tragedy such as this
will never happen again.

38
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,192
look out !

39
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,493
wah ?

40
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,662
was that a stop sign
back there ?

41
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,397
( screaming )

42
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,807
ohhh, i think
i hit a pothole.

43
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,844
hey dad, how come they
let old people drive ?

44
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,314
well, stan, it's
a very fragile issue.

45
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,049
but they kill people.

46
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,085
sometimes, yes,
but senior citizens

47
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,122
have to be dealt with
very gingerly, stan.

48
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,857
we can't just take
their licenses away.

49
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,592
i'll be god damned
if they think

50
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,760
they can take
my license away !

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,062
oh, hi, dad.

52
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,363
i heard what you said !

53
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,966
you wanna take driving
privileges away from seniors !

54
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,135
well, let me tell you
something, pecker-face,

55
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,737
i worked 55 years
in a steel mill...

56
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,038
yes, dad.

57
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,207
and i flew spitfires over
germany in world war ii...

58
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,942
yes, i know.

59
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,677
and i will be god damned
if the government thinks

60
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,148
it can step in and take away
my right to drive !

61
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,316
i think old people should
have rights, grandpa.

62
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,919
i just don't wanna die.

63
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,389
( humming )

64
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,425
( ominous "jaws"-like music )

65
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,932
dammit, mona, this
isn't the fastest way

66
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,667
tocountry
kitchen buffet!

67
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,137
no, but it's the shortest,
save the most gas that way.

68
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,548
you save more gas
if you take the highway

69
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,716
to country
kitchen buffet !

70
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,187
less miles means less gas,
you old fool !

71
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,392
there's country kitchen
right there !

72
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,693
where ?

73
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,296
back there,
you're gonna miss it !

74
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,103
is this the
parking lot ?

75
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,405
i think so.

76
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,044
another death tonight by
a senior citizen motorist !

77
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,213
carl zorn of pine junction
was killed instantly

78
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,683
when struck by a vehicle
driven by pete and lydia melman,

79
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,285
who were trying to find
country kitchen buffet.

80
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,020
this latest tragedy
comes only two days

81
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,755
after the accident
in deer creek,

82
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,924
where three construction
workers in a bulldozer

83
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,093
were run down by
senior citizen paul tobb,

84
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,129
who was trying to find
country kitchen buffet.

85
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,298
public outcry is forcing
the d.m.v. to consider

86
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,901
suspending the licenses of
all seniors over 70,

87
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,503
though no decision
has yet to be made.

88
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,407
seniors of south park !

89
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,444
i don't know about you,
but i am mad as hell !

90
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,046
yeah !
yeah !

91
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,516
i'm sick of having
my mental condition

92
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,685
come into question !

93
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,854
yeah !
that's right !

94
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,457
we need to let everyone know
we're pissed off

95
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,493
and we're not gonna
take it anymore !

96
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,794
hear, hear !

97
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,096
that's right, pete !

98
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,397
that's right !

99
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,132
now...

100
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,036
can anybody remember what
we're pissed off about ?

101
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,711
i remember we're all
pissed about something.

102
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,880
that's why we had
this meeting,

103
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,784
but i can't
for the life of me...

104
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,519
ooh, was it the kids

105
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,122
skateboarding
on the sidewalks ?

106
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,857
no...

107
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,158
oh, i remember !

108
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,761
they're going to take
our licenses away !

109
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,665
that's right, they're gonna try
and take our licenses away !

110
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,135
and i for one
am mad as hell !

111
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,870
me too !
yeah, that's right !

112
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,171
i'm mad too !

113
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,942
i am sick of having my mental
condition come into question !

114
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:13,413
so now, what are we
gonna do about it ?

115
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,581
do about what ?

116
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,750
they're gonna take
our licenses away.

117
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,052
they are ?!

118
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,353
they can't
do that !

119
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,088
you said it !

120
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,558
that's right, so you know what
i think we should do ?

121
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:29,028
i think we should have
a senior citizens meeting !

122
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,065
get all the seniors together
at the community center

123
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,667
and unite !

124
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,402
great idea, marvin !

125
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,306
wait, i think we're having
that meeting right now.

126
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,909
oh, right,
this is the meeting.

127
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,644
right, to get them
damn kids

128
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,813
to stop skateboarding
on the sidewalks !

129
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,548
yeah !
that's right !

130
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,150
we gotta stop 'em !

131
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,753
sharon,
have you seen dad ?

132
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,488
he's not here, honey,
he's having a meeting

133
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,524
with all the seniors in town
at the community center.

134
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,259
oh.

135
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,561
wait a minute.

136
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,163
if all the seniors in town
are at a meeting,

137
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,633
that means that when
the meeting gets out...

138
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,104
every senior in town
will be driving home...

139
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,574
at the same time.

140
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,044
oh-my-god !

141
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,779
get inside !

142
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,948
get inside !

143
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,550
seniors meeting
getting out !

144
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,719
get off the streets !

145
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,358
all right,
great meeting, everyone.

146
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,527
let's do it again
sometime.

147
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,696
so long, everybody !

148
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,431
good-bye, lucy.

149
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:45,371
get off the streets !
get off the streets !

150
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,974
old people
are driving !

151
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,143
( screaming )

152
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,046
gerald !
where are the boys ?

153
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,348
we've gotta
get out of here !

154
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,517
the boys, gerald,
where are they ?!

155
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,818
they're, they're...

156
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,987
they're playing
street hockey !

157
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,457
oh-my-god !

158
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,626
with just 10 seconds to go,
the offense makes its move !

159
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,361
marsh heads for the goal

160
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,662
and passes the ball
to the poor kid !

161
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,963
the poor kid hands it off
to the jew !

162
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,265
the jew shoots !

163
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,000
oh, and the shot
is blocked again !

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,602
proving once and for all that
jews cannot play hockey !

165
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,904
it isn't fair !

166
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,205
cartman's fatter
than the goal !

167
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,808
i'm not fat, i just have
a sweet hockey body.

168
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,976
( yelling in the distance )
get off the streets !

169
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,711
get off
the streets !

170
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,447
dude, look.

171
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,483
get off !
the streets !

172
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,652
get off the streets !

173
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,821
what is that ?
i don't know.

174
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,122
get off !

175
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,158
get streets
off the streets !

176
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,460
dude, is that
your dad ?

177
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,761
i think so.

178
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,062
looks like

193
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,667

( screaming )

205
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,802

voices down !

209
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,309
we'll stay
the night in here.

210
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,478
we'll stay the whole
winter if we have to.

211
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,779
i'm not staying the
winter in this room !

212
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,948
you need to tell old people
they can't drive anymore !

213
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,683
aw, stan, it's not
that simple !

214
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,418
just relax while
i find the lights.

215
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,587
here we go.

216
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,756
( old man )
how the hell did we
get up here ?

217
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,491
aaaahgh !

218
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,660
i told you this was
the wrong way.

219
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,300
tom, i'm standing outside of
the department of motor vehicles

220
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,902
where senior citizens
have until 3:00 p.m.

221
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,505
to hand over
their driver's licenses.

222
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,107
the new law was passed
just three days

223
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,409
after the night of horror,

224
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,445
in which all seniors were out
driving at the same time,

225
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,783
causing 14 deaths and
$3 million in damage.

226
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,819
alrighty...
there we go.

227
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,988
next !

228
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,723
it ain't right
what you're doin' !

229
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,458
i never had an accident
in my life !

230
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,759
that's right.

231
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,494
you shouldn't
punish all of us !

232
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,663
we're sorry, but this is
the only way to be sure.

233
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,965
next, please.

234
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,266
there we go.

235
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,302
but how am i supposed to
get to the grocery store ?

236
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,471
or the pharmacy
to buy medicine ?

237
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,941
well, maybe, you should be
in a nursing home, hmm ?

238
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,110
some of us would
rather die !

239
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,713
well, we can certainly
help you with that too.

240
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,881
we aren't second-class
citizens !

241
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,050
that's right,
you can take our licenses,

242
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,653
but you'll never take
our pride !

243
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,388
yeah...

244
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,292
ahhh, isn't this
great, you guys ?

245
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,027
being able to walk the streets
now that old people

246
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,762
are confined to their homes
where they belong.

247
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,063
( car honks )

248
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,365
billy, get in the car.

249
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,401
i need you boys to help me
pick up my newhoverround.

250
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,136
uh, grandpa,

251
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,871
i don't think you're
supposed to be driving.

252
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,172
god dammit, billy !

253
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,341
you're supposed to listen
to your dad, right ?

254
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,643
well, i'm your dad's dad !

255
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,944
and that means
you get in this car

256
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,546
before i tan
all your hides !

257
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,715
well, look at it
this way:

258
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,884
statistically speaking,
we're saferinsidea car

259
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,053
with an old person
driving, than outside.

260
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,788
my god, he's right.

261
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,258
hail mary, full of grace,
the lord is with thee.

262
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,993
i shall not walk through
the valley of death.

263
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,728
ergghhh...

264
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,897

265
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,066
but, well,

266
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,235

268
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,572

272
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,718

273
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,188

car behind you, grandpa.

274
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,357

00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,323
oh, brother.

287
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,492
well, good job, dad,

288
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,227
oh, god dammit,

289
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,962
you son of a bitch !

290
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,131
you just had to be so damn
stubborn, didn't you ?

291
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,167
now my son is gonna
talk to me like i'm 12 !

292
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,770
we're not treating you like
children, dad, all right ?

293
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,372
now i think you owe mr.
police officer an apology.

294
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,108
who needs to
apologize, hmm ?

295
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,843
who's a sorry sorry ?

296
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,578
kiss my sagging ass !

297
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,879
well fine, i was
gonna bail you out,

298
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,614
but maybe you can just
sit here for a bit

299
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,915
and think about
what you did.

300
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,650
i won't be
sitting here long.

301
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,385
i've already called
the a.a.r.p. !

302
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,687
what's that ?

303
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,723
the american association
of retired persons--

304
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,760
the largest political group
in the country !

305
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,362
when seniors like me are
being discriminated against,

306
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,398
the a.a.r.p. comes
and sets it right.

307
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,435
and you're gonna be sorry
when they get here !

308
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,170
( school bell rings )

309
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,640
and so you see, children,
genghis khan was a mongol,

310
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,676
not to be confused
with a mongoloid,

311
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,713
like the actor
nicolas cage.

312
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:05,050
okay now, who can
tell me in what year...

313
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,388
the first film by...
the mongoloid...

314
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,557
that's odd.

315
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,895
those r.o.t.c. guys
are way off course.

316
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,967
more old people !

317
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,136
the american association
of retired persons.

318
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,040
stay in your seats, children,
i'll be right back.

319
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,775

320
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,378

00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,489
we came as fast as we could.

337
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,526
we just had to stop by
country kitchen buffet first.

338
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,261

00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,035
mrs. ryland, seniors
are taking over the town.

356
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,770
would you like a gun ?

357
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,505
i suppose so.

358
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,806
what the hell
is going on ?

359
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,975
shut your pie hole
and get over there !

360
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,144
randy, what is this ?

361
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,445
hah !

362
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,048
you are now under the
authority of the a.a.r.p. !

363
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,084
ha !  there you go,
mr. smart mouth !

364
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,386
look at ya now !

365
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,121
dad, what are you doing ?

366
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,856
the a.a.r.p. is going to
help us take this town

367
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,458
until we get our
licenses back !

368
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,929
yeah, and we're gonna ask for
more money in medicare too !

369
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,230
that's right !
yeah !

370
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,965
have you all got
alzheimer's ?

371
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,266
they're not gonna
listen to

372
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,001
a bunch of whacked out
senior citizens !

373
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,303
hah ?

374
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,038
we'll tell 'em if they
don't give us our demands

375
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,206
we'll start
killing hostages !

376
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,677
right, they're gonna
really believe that !

377
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,845
isn't that a little
extreme, bill ?

378
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,147
hah ?

379
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,448
no, we gotta be tough !

380
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,183
just like with those
damn japs !

381
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,786
this is insane, dad, you all
need to stop right now

382
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,521
before more people
get hurt.

383
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,256
the time when you can
tell me what to do

384
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,991
is over, bucky boy !

385
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,593
we're in charge now !

386
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,202
all right, we've got control
of the mayor's office

387
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,937
and the fire station.

388
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,106
reinforcements
have arrived

389
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,841
from the nursing home
in conifer.

390
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,142
good !

391
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,179
hell, us senior citizens could
take over the entire country !

392
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,348
we've got company !

393
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,685
( man over loudspeaker )
attention, seniors.

394
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,589
lay down your weapons
and turn yourselves over.

395
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:33,192
mrs. applegate, show 'em
we mean business.

396
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,493
all right.

397
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,867
what do you want ?

398
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,168
hah ?

399
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,771
we want our
licenses back !

400
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,072
yeah !

401
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,109
that's right, and we want
more money in medicare !

402
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,844
yeah !

403
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,145
and we want those
damn kids

404
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,748
to stop skateboarding
on the sidewalks !

405
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,483
yeah !

406
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:03,989
hey, dad.

407
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,158
stan !  boys !
you're safe !

408
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,893
dad, why is everyone letting
the old people do this ?

409
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,194
why doesn't somebody
stop them ?

410
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,929
they've tried to
stop them, son,

411
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,098
but the seniors get up
so early in the morning

412
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,701
they get everything done before
everyone else is even awake.

413
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,002
they're saying
something about

414
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,303
taking over
the whole country.

415
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,472
yes, and now seeing
how early they get up,

416
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,075
i don't see how
anyone can stop them.

417
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,810
wait a minute, you boys !

418
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,979
you get up almost
as early as they do,

419
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,280
you can fight them !

420
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,015
aw, come on, dad,
can't you guys do it ?

421
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,618
no son, we...
like to sleep in.

422
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,220
( old woman )
two hostages come
front and center !

423
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,522
they're coming !

424
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,823
get out of here
before they see you.

425
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,859
run to the hills and find
a way to fight them, go !

426
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,462
boys-- avenge me !

427
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,932
avenge me !!

428
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,233
all right, check it out.

429
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,968
kenny did reconnaissance
on the town.

430
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,703
the old people have blockades
here and here.

431
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,306
old ladies are keeping watch
in towers around the perimeter.

432
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,607
the leaders, along
with my grandpa,

433
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,342
are most likely
in the mayor's office.

434
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,511
( eric )
so our only solution is to
cut off their life force.

435
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,246
( kyle )
we can't fight them,
cartman.

436
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,548
no, but we can sneak
into town

437
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,283
and shut down
their food supply.

438
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,018
here.

439
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,319
country kitchen buffet ?

440
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,620
yeah, you take out
country kitchen buffet

441
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,355
and old people
won't know what to do.

442
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,657
that's a retarded idea,
cartman !

443
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,958
is it ?

444
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,259
two years ago they closed
the country kitchen buffet

445
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,994
in steamboat springs
and all the old people

446
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,729
died of starvation
in less than a week.

447
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,031
yeah, i remember
hearing about that.

448
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,332
even if it
could work,

449
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,067
how would we go about
shutting it down ?

450
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,368
i think i have a plan.

451
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,971
but we'll have to
do it tonight.

452
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,574
( eric )
we'll start by
sneaking into town,

453
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,176
cleverly disguised
as black people.

454
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,911
at 5:45, kenny
and kyle split off

455
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,080
and set a diversion
on the east side of town.

456
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,815
( train whistle tooting )

457
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,550
meanwhile, stan and i sneak
into the mayor's office

458
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,852
and steal some of
the explosives

459
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,587
the old people
have stashed.

460
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,755
9:00, we rendezvous at
the country kitchen buffet

461
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,358
where we strap the explosives
and the timer to kyle's chest.

462
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,093
we say our tearful
good-byes to kyle

463
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,262
and then send him inside.

464
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,600
yeah !
all right !

465
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,901
i did it !

466
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,371
yeah, or we just go to
country kitchen buffet

467
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,672
and lock it
from the inside

468
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,407
so the seniors
can't get in.

469
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,143
well, right,
or we do that.

470
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,914
all right, everyone,
round up your ammunition

471
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,215
and get ready to move !

472
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,685
we're taking this war
further out !

473
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,854
all right !
let's go !

474
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,457
look, bob, i appreciate
what the a.a.r.p.

475
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,192
is trying to do for us,

476
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,228
but all we want
is our licenses back.

477
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,963
hah ?
heck no !

478
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,265
this is going too well.

479
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,433
we're gonna take the
whole country back,

480
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,602
wipe out everyone
below the age of 65 !

481
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,337
wipe 'em out ?

482
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,072
what are you, senile ?!

483
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,374
come on, everyone !

484
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,543
it's time to
plan phase 2 !

485
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,579
what the heck ?

486
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,615
hah ?
what is this ?

487
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,085
it's six a.m., country kitchen
should be open !

488
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,556
it's not open ?
has to be !

489
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,158
try a window !

490
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,761
they're blocked from
the inside !

491
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,062
no...

492
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,231
no, let us in !
let us in !

493
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,966
open the door !

494
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,267
it's six a.m. !

495
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,002
it's six a.m. !

496
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,605
open the country
kitchen buffet !

497
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,340
you have to
let us in !

498
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,545
ugh... argh...

499
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,353
all right, everyone,
area secure !

500
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,389
collect their weapons
and free the hostages.

501
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,558
that was a great
strategy, boys,

502
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,595
you may very well have saved
this entire country.

503
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,896
( yawning )

504
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,631
what happened ?
is it over ?

505
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,932
everything is fine.

506
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,101
control of the town
is back to you folks.

507
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,137
country kitchen...
what happened ?

508
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,872
sir, what should we do
with this one ?

509
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,608
it's up to
the townspeople.

510
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,776
well, i think he learned
his lesson, huh ?

511
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,511
don't you feel
silly now, dad ?

512
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,680
i think somebody owes us
all an apology.

513
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,982
yes he does.

514
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,283
oh, stop it, dad !

515
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,150
this is partly
your fault !

516
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,885
huh ?

517
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,621
look, all grandpa wants is not
to be talked to like a child.

518
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,922
i think half of what
he was angry about

519
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,657
wasn't what you were doing,
but how you were doing it.

520
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,392
that's right.

521
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,693
and grandpa,
you should be proud

522
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,428
that you made it though life
to be a senior,

523
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,296
but you should also realize

524
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,031
that when you get
behind the wheel

525
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,332
you're a killing
machine.

526
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,200
i know.

527
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,501
i guess sometimes
us seniors

528
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,236
need to know
when to stop driving

529
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,273
so we don't put the
responsibility on our families.

530
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,441
