thank you, thank you.

46
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,615
bear walked into
a bar.

47
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,953
bear said to deer,
"may i please...

48
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,122
have a drink ?"

49
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,724
and so
deer said to bear

50
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,459
"why the big pause ?"

51
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,194
( drum thump )

52
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,929
( indian war chanting )

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,532
ha ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha !

54
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,303
many moons ago, pony and
eagle walked up to coyote.

55
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,773
pony said to coyote,
"i am very mad at eagle.

56
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,376
will you yell at him
for me ?"

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,111
coyote said to pony,

58
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,148
"why can you not
yell yourself ?"

59
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,449
and pony replied,

60
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,618
"because i am
a little horse."

61
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,353
( drum thump )

62
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,955

where did you get
that kind of money ?

74
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,210
the casino gave me credit.

75
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,511
i put the house up
as collateral.

76
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,812
but i still have
this $10 chip !

77
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,981

78
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,018

82
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,789

83
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,090

the song of the sparrow.

86
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,464

sparrow up your ass !

87
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,935

88
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,537
how do i tell them that tomorrow
we have to pack up our things

89
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,706
and get out of
the house ?

90
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,007

91
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,742

you guys been ?

93
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,911
we've been
looking all over.

94
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,646
yeah, come on, dad,
this place sucks !

95
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,948

98
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,719

00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,454
okay, fine, kyle,

100
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,623

101
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,924

102
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,659

103
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,394

leave south park, fine !

104
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,563
tomorrow we're leaving !

105
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,864
gerald, what are you
talking about ?

106
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,467
oh, you heard him, sheila--
kyle wants to leave.

107
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,937
our nice old house doesn't
"interest" kyle anymore.

108
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,106
well, i'm calling a moving
company right now !

109
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,576
you shouldn't be
such a dick, dude.

110
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,745
what's wrong with gerald ?

111
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,781
he... he lost his house
to the native americans.

112
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,083
what ?

113
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,252
but don't the native americans
know he has nowhere else to go ?

114
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,288
they don't care.

115
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,059
look at them,
small-minded idiots

116
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,794
pouring their
life's savings away.

117
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,096
their cash flows
out of them

118
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,831
like diarrhea
from the buffalo.

119
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,867
yes, but we have milked these
simple mountain folk almost dry.

120
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,470
if we really
want to see cash flow

121
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,072
we need to bring in
city people, from denver.

122
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,807
yes...

123
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,410
it is time for us to
implement our plan !

124
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,314
a super highway, built from
denver right to our casino !

125
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,350
and we do we do about the
small town of south park

126
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,519
that lies in the
highway's way ?

127
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,820
simple...

128
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,724
we buy it
and we demolish it.

129
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,893
( chanting laugh )
ha ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha !

130
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,062
ha ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha !

131
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,098
and that's really
all i can tell you.

132
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,833
the town of south park
is going to be leveled

133
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,870
in order to make way for
a 12-lane super highway.

134
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,605
but how can they
do that ?

135
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,340
the native americans
have purchased the land

136
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,641
out from under us.

137
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,810
tomorrow they're buying
the last of what they need

138
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,111
to have
complete ownership.

139
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,413
well, can't we
stop them ?

140
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,714
let's call the bank !

141
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,449
the native americans
bought the bank.

142
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,750
oh my god !

143
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,485
now look, it isn't
all horrible.

144
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,787
the native americans are
offering you retail values

145
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,088
on your homes.

146
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,823
no, screw that !

147
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,691
we'll just pool
our money together

148
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,426
and buy the town
ourselves !

149
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,161
that's right !
yeah !

150
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,896
yeah, let the south park
people own south park !

151
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,631
yeah !

152
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,932
how much do we
have to raise, mayor ?

153
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,704
three hundred
thousand dollars.

154
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,174
oh, never mind.

155
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,210
how can they
do that, huh ?

156
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,511
how can they make us
all move away ?

157
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,680
because they're rich,
greedy-ass indians.

158
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,548
native americans.

159
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,018
our whole town, gone...

160
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,620
we've had such
great times here...

161
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,789
( screams of mayhem )

162
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,067
we can't let them
do it, you guys !

163
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,670
we have to find a way to
stop those native americans !

164
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,971
yeah !

165
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,272
yeah,
this is our town !

166
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,574
we shouldn't have to make
a bunch of new friends

167
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,875
somewhere else,
we're a team !

168
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,743
yeah, that's right !

169
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,044
that's right !

170
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,345
yeah,
we're a team.

171
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,382
we just have to figure out
a way to raise $300,000.

172
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,683
wait a minute !
i've got it, you guys !

173
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,285
we can get kyle
infected with aids

174
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,587
and then start
a charity organization

175
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,322
that we steal
money from !

176
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,491
come on, let's go !

177
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,997
no ?  we can't
give kyle aids ?

178
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,732
we need something that will
get us money tomorrow.

179
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,901
hey, i know,
how about a dog parade ?

180
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,202
dog parade ?

181
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,371
yeah, we dress up all our
dogs in little outfits

182
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,672
and parade them
down the street.

183
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,408
it'd be so adorable !

184
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,143
how do we make $300,000
doing that ?

185
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,878
oh... well, we could
sell tickets

186
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,179
to our moms and dads !

187
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,914
our moms and dads are the ones
who need money, butters !!

188
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,083
oh...

189
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,119
maybe give
kyle aids, huh ?

190
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,288
lookin' a little
better now.

191
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,758
oh gerald,
i can't watch !

192
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,927
how can you do this
to people ?

193
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,831
we're sorry, but if we do not
build a super highway,

194
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,867
our casino might stop
seeing profits.

195
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,602
there's more to life
than profits.

196
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,205
like what ?

197
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,374
like, you know...
slurpees and stuff.

198
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,711
well, come on, honey.

199
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,880
i guess we should start
packing up our things as well.

200
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,917
yeah, so long,
south park.

201
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,085
mom !  dad !

202
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,821
we figured out a way
we could raise $300,000 !

203
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,122
a dog parade ?

204
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,423
no !

205
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,592
stan, we've all tried
to raise money

206
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,327
but we only raised
$10,000

207
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,062
and the deadline
is tomorrow.

208
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,797
i know, so how about
we take the $10,000

209
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,532
back to the
indian casino ?

210
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,400
tell them, kyle.

211
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,002
the odds on a single number
in roulette are 35 to 1.

212
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,906
that means with a $10,000 bet
you win 350,000 !

213
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,208
boys,
that's ridiculous.

214
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,943
look, we've got
nothing to lose.

215
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,244
what do you guys think ?

216
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,979
it's a long shot.

217
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,883
yeah, but its the only shot
we've got to save our town.

218
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,522
"the residents of south park
had hoped to raise $300,000

219
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,124
"but in the end managed
to raise only 10.

220
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,860
"the loss of their town
may be imminent

221
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,161
for the poor people
of south park."

222
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,763
aww, i fink i'm going
to cwyyy !

223
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,932
ha ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha !

224
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,402
alright, boys, you're
gonna have to wait here.

225
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,137
dad--

226
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,740
good luck.

227
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,343
it's in
god's hands now.

228
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:34,247
stand aside, everyone !

229
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,717
what are they doing ?

230
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,886
we're gonna try to beat you
at your own game,

231
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,621
chief runswithpremise !

232
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,657
$10,000--
on 31 black.

233
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,826
( crowd gasps )

234
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,332
impossible.

235
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,935
come on,
come on...

236
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,756
thirty one...
black.

237
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,925
( cheering )

238
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,626
we did it !
we did it !

239
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,928
oh my god !

240
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,229
oh, this is amazing !

241
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,530
no !
noooo !

242
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,831
they did it !
they did it !

243
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,000
south park is saved !

244
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,169
we have plenty enough
to save our town now !

245
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,772
yeah !
but wait--

246
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,808
$350,000-- that means
if we won again

247
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,411
it would be 12 and
a quarter million !

248
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,013
we could save the town
and be super rich !

249
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,315
oh, hell yeah,
let it ride !

250
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,616
let it ride !

251
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,652
what the hell
are they doing ?!

252
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,689
let's go, 31 !
let's see it !,

253
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,460
two, red,
you lose.

254
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,195
( everyone )
awwww !!

255
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,930
dammit !

256
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,665
hmm !

257
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,834
they--
they had it !

258
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,569
they freakin' had it !

259
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,341
you totally had it.

260
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,076
you had enough to save
the town and then some.

261
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,811
stan, okay ?

262
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,980
you just don't understand
the fine points of gambling.

263
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,281
you're never
supposed to stop

264
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,016
when you're on
a winning streak.

265
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,751
a winning streak ?!
you played one game !

266
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,052
stan, okay ?

267
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,354
what ?!

268
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,655
alright, stan,
okay ?

269
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,824
you people just got greedy
like the native americans.

270
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,559
hey, mister !

271
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,728
we are not like them,
alright ?!

272
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,463
now we may have pie-in-the-
sky dreams once in a while,

273
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,065
but we aren't the ones kicking
people out of their homes.

274
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,668
so don't you compare us
to those coldhearted,

275
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,837
moneygrubbing, evil,
stinky indians !

276
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,006
i'm sorry--
native americans.

277
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,416
there you are, sir, there's
the check for your home.

278
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,717
just sign here and here.

279
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,187
well, this is it, mr. slave,
we're officially homeless.

280
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,922
( sobbing )

281
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,959
oh, jesus...
jesus christ !

282
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,260
dad, what are you doing ?

283
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,561
don't take their
dirty money !

284
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,863
stanley, we don't
have a choice.

285
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,032
the native americans
own south park now.

286
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,634
we have to take what they'll
give us for our homes.

287
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,237
there you go,
have a nice day.

288
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,839
come on, you guys,
this is our town !

289
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,876
it's over, stanley,
what else can we do ?

290
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,611
we can stay--
and fight.

291
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,780
yeah, when the indians come
to tear up our town,

292
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,081
we kick 'em
in the nuts !!

293
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,382
yeah !

294
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,117
yeah, they don't own
our town-- we do !

295
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,852
i'm sorry, boys,

296
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,154
you just don't
understand economics.

297
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,889
it'll be okay, boys,

298
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,058
we'll just move to
the next town over.

299
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,226
oh sure, until the
native americans decide

300
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,528
they want
that land, too.

301
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,697
what if the native americans
just keep building their casinos

302
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,865
and their highways, until
we have nowhere else to go ?

303
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,902
we have to stand up
to them, now !

304
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,372
forget it.
come on, you guys !

305
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,541
you're all a bunch of
god damn pussies !

306
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,156
get out of our way !

307
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,891
no, we won't let you
destroy our town !

308
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,494
boys, it isn't
your town anymore.

309
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,229
just because you have a piece
of paper saying you own it

310
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,530
doesn't make it yours.

311
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,265
we grew up here,
our parents grew up here.

312
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,868
we shop at thatwal-mart
and eat at thatchili's.

313
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,169
we take fish from the streams

314
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,904
and bread them and freeze them
to make fish sticks.

315
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,507
this is not just a town,
it is our way of life.

316
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,977
well, your way of life is about
to change, little boys.

317
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,278
now, move !

318
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,013
you can't just roll into places
and take people's lives away !

319
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,917
and what are four little boys
going to do to stop us, huh ?

320
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,954
( crowd chanting )
bom bom bom, bom bom.

321
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,556

dammit !

329
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,523
i thought you said
they were dealt with !

330
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,390
they were !

331
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,691

filthy, bastard,
native american money.

334
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,065
oh, right,
sorry about that.

335
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,801
this isn't over !

336
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,873
( trucks beeping reverse )

337
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,476
we'll never give up !

338
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,211
you bastards !

339
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,512
yeah, south park
is ours !

340
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,681
but what do we do now ?

341
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,585
i mean, we can't stand here
and block their way forever.

342
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,621
we can stand here
as long as it takes !

343
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,333
what is the state
of our people ?

344
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,936
last night i spoke with
the spirit of the bear.

345
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,972
and bear said that
if we do not build
our super highway soon,

346
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,707
our investors
may soon sell off

347
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,442
their shares of
the new casino.

348
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,478
yes, and eagle says the
cumulative shared market loss

349
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,949
on the revenue of the new
casino drops 15% every day.

350
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,117
then we must force
the south park people

351
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,853
off their petty land.

352
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,154
but they are determined
and proud.

353
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,190
and the spirit of the wind has
stated that if we use force

354
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,925
it could be
a publicity nightmare,

355
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,660
further hurting
our net assets.

356
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,697
i already have a plan how we
can force them off their land...

357
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,998
sneakily.

358
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,733
we're going to
give them...

359
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,468
blankets !

360
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,637
blankets ?

361
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,240
yes, we will present the
blankets as a peace offering.

362
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,975
but what the round eyes
will not know,

363
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,879
is that the blankets are
infected with sars !

364
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,481
they will all get sars !

365
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,517
and then sars will run through
their town like a buffalo.

366
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,120
now, i need your help getting
the sars onto the blankets.

367
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,892
okay, bring them in !

368
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,627
( mock chinese )

369
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,229
let's see how south park
deals with this !

370
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,832
( yelling in chinese )

371
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,001
everyone, grab
a chinese person

372
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,169
and rub them
on a blanket !

373
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,772
make sure you rub them
all over !

374
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,507
get the sars
nice and deep in there.

375
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,881
tom, i'm standing in
chilly south park, colorado

376
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,716
where the residents are
entering the third day

377
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,885
of their sit-in to try
and stop native americans

378
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,488
from building a super highway
through their town.

379
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,958
the temperature is low, but
spirits are pretty low too.

380
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,163
what do they want ?

381
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,898
we're not moving,
ass-faces !

382
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,633
free blanket ?

383
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,670
though we know
we have differences,

384
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,272
we believe that a compromise
can be reached.

385
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,309
in the meantime, it hurts us
to see you all on television

386
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,610
sitting in the cold.

387
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,080
will you not take this offering
as a gesture of goodwill ?

388
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,116
you had me
at "free blanket".

389
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,057
free blanket ?
free blanket ?

390
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,358
blanket ?

391
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,093
tom, it now looks as if
the native americans

392
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,696
are handing out blankets
as a sign of goodwill

393
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,997
towards the
south park people.

394
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,166
what an incredible display
of compassion.

395
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,768
i certainly hope there's
nothing sinister behind it.

396
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,371
please, as a token
of good faith.

397
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,841
you... understand if i'm a
little wary of trusting you.

398
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,576
it is only a blanket,
mr. marsh.

399
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,745
well, thanks.

400
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,649
oh...
you're welcome.

401
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,119
( coughing, groaning )

402
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,420
tom, it's tuesday
morning now

403
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,155
and the outbreak of sars
in south park

404
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,324
has reached
epic proportions.

405
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,192
( coughs, sniffs )

406
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,927
the entire town
has been quarantined

407
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,529
by the federal government,
nobody allowed in or out,

408
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,566
which means nobody can
come to our aid.

409
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,337
it appears this town, and this
reporter, are done for.

410
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,506
coming up next, choosing
the right hair conditioner--

411
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,241
what you don't know about
hair care products

412
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,844
could be costing you
a bundle !

413
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,314
( coughing )

414
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,615
it's alright, dad.

415
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,916
how is your mother ?

416
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,218
she's hanging in there.

417
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,820
here, drink some beer.

418
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,290
it's cool on my tongue.

419
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,592
you're gonna be
alright.

420
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,327
stanley, listen to me.

421
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,628
i have sars.

422
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,098
there's only a 98% chance
that i will live.

423
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,833
no, dad, no !

424
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,135
listen, stan !

425
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,303
sars is destroying
our people.

426
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,906
the native americans put it
in the blankets they gave us.

427
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,207
( coughs )

428
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,810
soon there will be
only 98% of us left.

429
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,979
what can i do ?

430
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,883
you-- must find a cure
for sars, son,

431
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,618
and save our people.

432
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,353
cure sars ?!
aw, jesus !

433
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,088
the spirit of
middle-class white people

434
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,389
is strong in you, stan.

435
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,293
seek out the wise man
in bellocreek.

436
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,462
now go, go !

437
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,306
( knocks )

438
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,607
what ?

439
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,342
hey, my name's stan,
and i was--

440
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,511
your coming was
foretold to me.

441
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,680
you've come to
save our people.

442
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,548
come in.

443
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,283
watch the cats.

444
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,018
uh, so, do you know
how to cure sars ?

445
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,319
me ?  ha !

446
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,488
no, i am just a guide.

447
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,223
sit down.

448
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,392
you must find
the answer yourself

449
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,561
by taking
an inward journey.

450
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,296
an inward journey ?
that sounds kinda gay.

451
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:21,633
let the voices of our
ancestors show you the way.

452
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,670
breathe... breathe from
the bag of visions.

453
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,176
ugh.
oh, dude !

454
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,948
how much longer must we wait
for our super highway ?

455
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,550
sars has spread throughout
the entire town of south park,

456
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,852
chief runswithpremise.

457
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,587
their wills
will break soon.

458
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,322
then i suppose we
must be patient.

459
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,057
runswithpremise,
come quickly !

460
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,358
what is the matter,
wife ?

461
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,527
it is our son,
premiserunningthin,

462
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,696
he is very sick !

463
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,467
premiserunningthin,
what is the matter ?

464
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,070
he... he shared a glass with
one of the people from china.

465
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,805
he has sars.

466
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,672
no !

467
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,407
i told you
not to touch them !

468
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,275
papa...

469
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:04,576
papaaa...

470
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,745
i have given him herbs
from the desert plant

471
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,914
and water from
the cactus of life,

472
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,517
but nothing
seems to be working.

473
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,119
this would not have happened
if those townpeople

474
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,288
would have just
moved away !

475
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,156
no more waiting around--

476
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,758
tomorrow we begin the
final stage of our plan !

477
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,927
shock and awe !

478
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,096
( groaning, coughing )

479
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:28,867
dad !  dad !

480
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,169
stanley !

481
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,337
did you have an inward journey
with the old man ?

482
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,072
did you have a vision ?

483
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,241
i don't know if i did or not,
i saw something,

484
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,543
someone spoke to me

485
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,278
and told me the middle-class
white way to cure sars--

486
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,748
campbell'schicken noodle soup,
dayquil,andsprite.

487
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,483
yes,
yes, of course.

488
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,652
quickly stan, we must
give it to everyone.

489
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,195
boy, that really
did the trick, stan.

490
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,363
i thought we were kinda,
sort of, not really done for !

491
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,532
thanks to you,
we're all safe now, stan.

492
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,701
( man )
aaahghgh !!!

493
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,774
now, i will blow your weak,
sars-infested bodies

494
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,376
off the earth !

495
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,280
what the--

496
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,148
wait a minute.

497
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,750
stop, stop !

498
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,654
your, your sars--
where did it go ?

499
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,992
we have cured ourselves using
the medicines of our culture.

500
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,330
my son, premiserunningthin,
has the sars as well.

501
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,366
you, you can cure him ?

502
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,740
it is amazing.

503
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,909
all our plants and herbs
failed to heal him.

504
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,644
but your people's remedy

505
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,680
brings the spirit of the
buffalo back into his heart.

506
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,415
perhaps there are
many things we can learn

507
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,150
from your way of life.

508
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,452
we're a simple people,

509
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,621
all we want is to be
allowed to live our lives.

510
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,356
you have cured
premiserunningthin.

511
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,693
in return, i shall give you all
$5 credit at the casino.

512
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,296
alright, alright.

513
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,898
i will not build a super
highway through your town,

514
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,634
and you can all
have your homes back.

515
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,369
alright !
yeah !

516
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,670
woo-hoo !

517
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,971
well, i guess we all
learned that south park

518
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,706
is more than just a town.

519
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,309
it's a community that
nobody can split up !

520
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,647
dude, who the hell
are you ?!

521
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,948
alex.

522
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,984
alex glick ?

523
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,587

the guest voice thingy ?

524
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,454

525
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,189
get the hell
