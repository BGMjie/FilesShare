yes ?
oh, hello, boys.

17
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,573
hello, sir, south park
junior detectives.

18
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,875
we're wondering if
you have any crimes

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,176
you need solved
for a dollar ?

20
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,911
ooh, little
crime stoppers, huh ?

21
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,947
well, i'm afraid i don't have
any crimes to solve right now.

22
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:48,815
aw, --- !

23
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,550
alright, sir,
well please call us

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,418
if you need anything.

25
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,153
i'll do that,
have fun, boys.

26
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,454
stupid assholes,

27
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,321
how come nobody has
a crime to solve ?

28
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,057
yeah, maybe starting
a detective club

29
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,358
isn't such a great idea.

30
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,225
it's a great idea,

31
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,960
we just have to
keep working at it.

32
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,864
oh, hello there, boys !

33
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,166
hello, ma'am, we're
detectives with

34
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,467
the south park crime unit.

35
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,768
do you have any
crimes you need solved,

36
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:09,636
for a dollar ?

37
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,371
ooh, neighborhood detectives !

38
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,540
well, let me think...
ooh yes, there is something !

39
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,841
really ?!

40
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,010
yes, two days ago i put
a fresh baked cherry pie

41
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:18,745
out on my
window sill to cool.

42
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,347
and later when i went
to get it, it was gone.

43
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,649
my god.

44
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,384
have you reported this
to any other authorities ?

45
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,420
no, but i think it's
a perfect case for you kids !

46
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,589
cool, we'll see
what we can find ma'am !

47
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,758
we're on the case !

48
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:33,927
what have
you got, marsh ?

49
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,529
detective mckormick found
something interesting.

50
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,168
jesus... we're too late.

51
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,205
i think we can piece
this case together, now.

52
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,675
my pie tin !

53
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,410
ooh, but what
happened to the pie ?

54
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,711
well, we've all
talked it through

55
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,446
and we've come up
with a theory.

56
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,615
well what do you think
happened, lil' detectives ?

57
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,916
you said you sat
the pie on the windowsill

58
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,386
where it must have
sat for some time...

59
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,989
but its sweet smell attracted
the attention of somebody--

60
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,158
your husband !

61
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,459
he wanted that pie, badly

62
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,628
but he knew that he was
not allowed to eat it yet.

63
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,231
slowly, the rage
built inside his mind.

64
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,966
"why won't she
let me eat this pie ?"

65
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,701
"why does she always stop me
from doing what i want to do ?"

66
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,436
his only solution
became obvious-

67
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,171
kill her.

68
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,472
his plan was
to use a hammer.

69
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,207
bash ! bash ! bash !
your skull in-

70
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,509
causing instant death.

71
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,244
then to make it impossible
for police to identify the body

72
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,979
he would use his shovel
to remove your head-

73
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,148
then saw off
the arms and legs !

74
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,316
the torso he would
dump into the lake...

75
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,051
the arms and legs
he would dissolve

76
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,786
with acid and lye
in the bathtub

77
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,088
and then finally,

78
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,389
he'd be able
to eat that pie.

79
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,558
but before he could go through
with his entire plan

80
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,293
he discovered that the pie
had already been eaten...

81
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,028
by your dog !

82
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,763
looks like the game
is over, old man.

83
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,366
oh my god !

84
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,402
what kind of television
have you kids been watching ?

85
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,137
just the news.

86
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,872
alright, alright,
you boys run along now !

87
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,475
hey, you owe us
a dollar, lady !

88
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,511
fine, here,  just go !

89
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,680
wow, look you guys
our first dollar !

90
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,716
we're in business !

91
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,054
kenny, you got the f.a.g.

92
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,355
on that perp
in washington ?

93
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,524
boys, you have
a little visitor.

94
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,296
is this the south park
crime unit ?

95
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,597
yes, it is !

96
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,332
i lost my dolly.

97
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,067
thank you, ms. secretary,
that will be all.

98
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,802
and get us more
cookies and coffee

99
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,971
we're not paying you
to sit on your ass !

100
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,272
do you know
where your doll is ?

101
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,309
if i knew where it was,
it wouldn't be lost.

102
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,044
alright, sarah
come over here...

103
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,779
now, i want you to describe
what the doll looks like

104
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,381
to our sketch artist, kenny.

105
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:40,153
she has curly blond hair
and a red dress...

106
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,755
and a turned up nose...

107
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,792
and a blue bow
in her hair...

108
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,093
you got it, ken ?

109
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,696
alright, let's see.

110
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,864
dammit, kenny that's
not what she said !

111
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,467
put that away, dude !

112
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,672
don't worry, ma'am,
we'll find your doll.

113
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,142
no sign of
forced entry...

114
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,444
but the window
isn't locked.

115
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,046
right, so it's possible the
thief sat out in that tree--

116
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,215
he would have watched
sarah with her doll,

117
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,384
possibly while cutting the palms
of his hand with a large knife-

118
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,119
the pain gave him
sick pleasure...

119
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,854
disposing of the doll
wouldn't be easy.

120
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,023
he would have had to brought
a shovel to decapitate it.

121
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,324
we're going to need
semen samples

122
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,059
from everything
in this room.

123
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,794
alright let's do this
by the books !

124
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,963
o'donnel, get me smears of all
the places the doll used to be.

125
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,698
mitchell, run a tap
on the phone.

126
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,433
hey, kid, what
are you doing ?

127
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,602
agent tucker, fbi...
and you ?

128
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,903
detective marsh.

129
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,072
i'm in charge of
this investigation.

130
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,374
not any more,
you're not.

131
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,675
hey, this is our case !

132
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,976
you can't come in
and take over !

133
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:37,844
can't we ?

134
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,145
you guys are
playing detectives,

135
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,446
we're playing fbi.

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,181
that gives us
jurisdiction over you.

137
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,483
oh crap !

138
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,784
i want choppers on the roof
ready to go !

139
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,953
dude, we've been working
this case since 2:30 !

140
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,555
good, then you can help us by
telling me everything you know.

141
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,158
son of a bitch,
stupid fbi !

142
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,761
well, i guess we can go back
to playing laundromat.

143
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,496
no, we're not gonna
stop playing detectives.

144
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,797
we've just got to find
that little girl's doll

145
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,532
before those
fbi guys do !

146
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,400
yeah !

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,267
yeah, but how ?

148
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,135
we're gonna
have to start

149
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,436
bringing in people
for questioning.

150
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,039
and i think i know
exactly where to start.

151
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,942
where were you this morning
at nine o'clock, butters ?

152
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,244
i was at home.

153
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,979
your story is full of holes
and i'm gonna beat your ass

154
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,280
if you don't start
telling the truth !

155
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,015
( mumbling )
aw, don't be so mean...

156
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,750
butters is our friend, huh...

157
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,353
they're really good at this
"good cop-bad cop" thing.

158
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,088
you're going down, butters
you hear me ?

159
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,124
aw, aw, don't feel bad,
poor little kid.

160
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,293
you're a worthless two dollar
criminal, and you're lying !

161
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,028
aw, it's okay,
poor lil' fella.

162
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,763
i don't have nothin'
to confess !

163
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,065
honestly !

164
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,535
fine, then you won't mind
giving us a semen sample.

165
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,402
how do i do that ?

166
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,137
you just make the semen
come out of your body

167
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,005
and put it
in this cup !

168
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,740
how do i make semen
come out of my body ?!

169
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,041
stop playing games !

170
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,343
i'm not playing,
i really don't know !!

171
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,813
that does it,
wait right here !

172
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,548
you guys,
did you hear that ?!

173
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,584
butters doesn't know how you
make semen come out your body !

174
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,753
howdoyou make
semen come out ?

175
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,054
i don't know,

189
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,610
until white stuff comes out,

272
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,514
we say you can't
charge the front door

273
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,683
and you have to obey what the
fbi says, that's the rules !

274
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,418
just because your parents can
afford better toys than ours

275
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,719
doesn't make you
better than us !

276

charge the front door.

282
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,636

00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,034
"the second floor

how they do things

366
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,047
down at that dog and pony show
they call the "fourth grade"

367
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,349
but here we haverules!

368
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,518
jesus, we don't even
have guys to question now

369
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,819
because you killed them all !

370
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,120
we're sorry.

371
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,421
one more slip-up
like that

372
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,157
and i'll have your badges
you hear me ?!

373
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,892
now hit the showers !

374
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,229
well, well, well,
if it isn't thesupercops!

375
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:21,567
hey murphy, think they'll
let me borrow their g.i. joes ?

376
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,170
come on you guys,
leave 'em alone.

377
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,073
relax hopkins, all
fun and games, right ?

378
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,375
so tell us, rookies,

379
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,411
you, uh, find yourself
a little 'bonus' in that house ?

380
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,279
a bonus ?

381
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,881
come on... we all
skim a little off the top.

382
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,484
oh... or are you too
good for that ?

383
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,653
you think you're
gonna waltz in here

384
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,954
and clean up
the system, is that it ?

385
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,123
we just wanna be
junior detectives.

386
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,424
look, we all work hard !

387
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,593
and we deserve more than
the 30,000 a year we get paid.

388
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,196
so what if we take in
a little on the side ?

389
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,931
yeah, who the hell
are you to change that ?

390
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,666
i said back off, murphy !

391
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,835
why don't you and your
rookie friends make us ?

392
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,136
c'mon, bring it !

393
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,172
what's the hell
is the problem here ?

394
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,209
no problem, sir...
no problem at all.

395
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,245
then hit the showers,
all of you !

396
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,185
dude, i don't wanna play
detective anymore.

397
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,486
me neither.

398
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,788
it'll get better, you guys.

399
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,089
better how, dude ?

400
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,390
look, we said we wanted
to form a club

401
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,692
to protect and
serve south park.

402
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,993
we put all this
time into it.

403
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,294
i mean, what do you
guys wanna do, huh ?

404
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,596
go back to playing
car mechanics ?

405
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,897
or laundromat owners ?

406
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,198
we were happy
playing laundromat owners.

407
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,499
i wasn't.

408
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,801
we started
playing detective

409
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,668
because we wanted our playtime
to mean something.

410
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,403
or have you forgotten why
you joined the force, kyle ?

411
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,138
hey, broflovski's
a good cop !

412
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,307
you guys can go back to playing
laundromat owners if you want-

413
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,476
but i'm not gonna give
those kids playing fbi

414
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,211
the chance to
laugh at us.

415
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,946
i'll see you guys
at school tomorrow.

416
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,754
ughh--ugnnn !

417
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,357
eric, where have
you been, it's 10:30 !

418
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,525
we had to take down
a meth lab on mala vista.

419
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,261
well you should have
called mommy !

420
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,128
will you get off my back !

421
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,429
it's hard enough
i gotta work the beat,

422
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,598
and then i gotta
come home to your nagging !

423
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,635
look, look, i'm sorry
it's just this case and...

424
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,370
the guys down
at the station.

425
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,538
i'm tired alright,
i'm tired.

426
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,707
well why don't you get ready
for snuggums night-night

427
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,744
and i'll bring you some
toasty chocolate nummers.

428
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,913
okay...

429
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,250
oooohhhh...
owwww.......

430
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,551
butters ?

431
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,419
yyess...

432
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,154
are you still trying
to give a semen sample ?

433
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,757
i'm trying, but
nothing's comin' out...

434
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,492
well, keep trying, butters.

435
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,227
okay...

436
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,094
ow...

437
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,829
ow !

438
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,300
and so you can see, children,

439
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,468
that the women's movement
of the late 50s and early 60s

440
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,505
had a profound effect on
feminism in america.

441
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,806
uh, boys !

442
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,842
would it trouble you terribly
not to sleep in my class ?!

443
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,011
we weren't sleeping,
mr. garrison.

444
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,746
oh, well then maybe you can
tell me who was in charge

445
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,349
of the feminist movement
of the early 60s !

446
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,518
a bunch of fat old skanks
on their periods ?

447
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:58,157
right, but who was the fattest,
oldest skank on her period ?

448
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,892
that's what i thought !

449
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,627
now pay attention !

450
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,362
okay, children, now the
biggest skank of all

451
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,097
was an old fat-ass
by the name of-

452
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,832
marsh, broflovski,
mckormick, cartman...

453
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,001
in my office !

454
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,736
ugh !
uhhh ! ughhh !

455
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,339
looks like that meth lab
you took down

456
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,074
was just the
tip of the iceberg.

457
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,809
they found a paper trail
leading all the way

458
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,411
to the biggest
crime syndicate in colorado.

459
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,279
uh-oh.

460
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,580
the operators apparently
run their business

461
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,749
out of a sleazy strip joint
down in englewood.

462
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,653
they're all cop killers, so
i'm sending you in undercover.

463
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,255
uh, sir, i have a lot
of homework to do tonight

464
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,123
and i was-

465
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,858
what ?!
now you listen to me -

466
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,159
i'm giving you
one last chance !

467
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,328
you're good cops, but you let
your emotions get in the way.

468
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,365
and your little shoot first,
ask questions later technique

469
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,967
has no place
in this century !

470
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,268
now you get down
to that strip joint

471
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,004
and you do it
by the books.

472
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,871
you got it ?!

473
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,775
the mayor is--  my ass--
bla bla bla !

474
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,414
so... what did you boys
have to say to the lieutenant ?

475
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,017
nothing, he just
told us a bunch of stuff.

476
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,619
maybe you decided you needed to
tell him about our...

477
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,920
"bonus money".

478
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,655
no.

479
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,957
they're lying.

480
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,559
they're dead.

481
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,204
dude, if my mom
knew i was in here

482
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,506
i would be in
super-big trouble.

483
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,976
woo-hoo !!!

484
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,181
would you like a dance ?

485
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,049
no, thanks.

486
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,350

487
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,085

488
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,386

your hands together

489
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,856

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,158

491
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,459
what the hell are
you kids doing in here ?

492
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,760
this isn't an appropriate
place for children !

493
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,495
dance ?

494
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,664
anyone like a dance ?

495
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,399
uh, it's okay
we know the owner.

496
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,436
oh really ?
let's go see.

497
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,737
alright, so we'll have to
start having the mckormicks

498
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,472
make our meth again...

499
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,207
hey gino, these kids
say they know you.

500
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,810
what ?!
i don't know no kids !

501
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,545
i didn't think so,

502
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,846
hey wait a minute !

503
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,581
these kids might be
just what we need

504
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,316
to get our drugs past
the security at d.i.a.

505
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,485

"peekew-peekew",

514
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,438
it goes
"bang ! bang ! bang !"

515
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,378

516
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,849

their heroically reckless ways !

murphy, jankins, hopkins

518
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,488

519
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,656

00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,368
great job boys, you found
the meth boss !

524
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,272
detective murphy, jankins
what the hell are you doing ?

525
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,573
we had a deal !!!

526
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,308
a deal ?!

527
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,345
that's right, we're partners
in the drug business.

528
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,947
everything was fine until these
supercops joined the force.

529
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,550
now we gotta
kill you all.

530
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,719
boys down !

531
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,225
alright guys put
your hands together

532
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,527
a lotta shootin'
and killin' going on

533
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,394
but be sure to
tip your waitress,

534
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,430
let's hear it
for re-bec-ca !

535
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,599
christ !

536
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,636
those junior detectives
have no regard for the law !

537
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,238
get me a hard line
to the phone !

538
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,973
and i want choppers
on the roof !

539
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:35,841
who the hell
are you ?

540
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,142
agent fields, fbi.

541
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,745
hey, i'm in charge of
this investigation !

542
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,480
not anymore you're not.

543
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,082
but that's not fair !

544
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,685
is so, is so !

545
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,456
aagh !!

546
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,059
sorry, detective hopkins,

547
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,662
we can't let anybody
know about our partnership !

548
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,830
that's right,
we split it all !

549
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,698
fifty-fifty !

550
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,867
that's right.

551
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,638
i think we'll take
a hundred percent now.

552
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,506
huh-huh, yeah.

553
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,241
sorry gino, but in
business like this

554
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,410
sometimes partnerships
need to end.

555
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,277
that's right.

556
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,482
sometimes partnerships
need to end.

557
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,784
well, supercops,

558
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,953
looks like i'll be
taking in all the money now.

559
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,688
i'm in business alone.

560
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,158
and that's means that the
only person i can't trust...

561
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,893
is myself !

562
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,436
looks like murphy and jankins
got what they deserved.

563
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:38,737
if it weren't
for you boys

564
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,472
we would have never
cleaned up the department.

565
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,641
alright, detectives let's
get one thing straight !

566
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,244
i do not agree
with your methods !

567
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,979
you're uncontrolled
and you're negligent...

568
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,015
but by god
you get the job done.

569
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,750
congratulations.

570
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,618
thanks.

571
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,353
i'm probably
gonna regret this, but,

572
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,955
well, i'm promoting you
to full detectives.

573
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,257
they'll be
lots more action

574
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,293
and that big paycheck
you've always wanted.

575
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,763
i think i have
a better idea.

576
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,799
hello, sir, welcome to the
broflovski laundromat.

577
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,402
yes, i have a suit i need dry
cleaned and pressed, please.

578
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,703
certainly.

579
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,005
here you are,
mr. mckormick,

580
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,173
your laundry is all done
and folded that will be $9.95.

581
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,342
on your
american express...

582
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,644
fellas, hey fellas !!!

583
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,379
i got it,
i got my semen sample !

584
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:21,680
you did ?

585
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,849
yeah, i was up there poundin' my
wiener for two days straight

586
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,451
and then finally i thought
about stan's mom's boobs

587
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,054
and this little tiny splooch
of this white stuff came out !

588
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,223
that's great, butters, but we're
not playing detective anymore.

589
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,524
we're playing
laundromat owners.

590
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,693
would you like those
pants cleaned for $4.95 ?

591
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,163

comedy central

592
