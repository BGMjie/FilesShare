223
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,784
how can you dropme?!

224
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,953
well, a very talented,
younger singer

225
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,254
has come to our attention

226
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,989
and the truth
of the matter is

227
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,592
her name happens to be
jennifer lopez as well,

228
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,062
and we really can't have
two here at b.h.i. records.

229
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,532
who the hell is this
other jennifer lopez ?!

231
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,436
well, she lives in
south park, colorado now,

232
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,039
but i believe she's originally
from mexico just like you.

233
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,774

no mexico !

234

i'm "puera rican" !

235
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,244
whatever, look,
it's nothing personal,

236
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,979
we just think
you need to move on.

237
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,714
and you're a
mean-spirited bitch

238
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,449
who spits on people
who aren't rich and famous.

239
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,486
and sources say that the new
film will star ben affleck !

240
