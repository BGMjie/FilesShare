Friends of mine *

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Okay, here he comes.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,234
Who wants to tell him ?

16
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:38,334
I'll do it.

17
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,968
Hey, fellas !
I'm glad you called me !

18
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:42,901
There's a pie eating contest
Down at the firehouse,

19
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,968
And i thought
We should all go !

20
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:45,934
Butters, could you
Take a seat, please ?

21
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, sure.

22
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:52,367
Butters, we have to have a very
Difficult conversation.

23
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,000
What is it ?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,067
Well, in the months since
Our friend kenny died

25
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,501
You've really stepped up
As a friend

26
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,400
And "filled the gap",
So to speak.

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,567
Oh, it's my pleasure !

28
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:01,734
I love being you guys'
New friend.

29
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:06,567
Yes, well, butters,
It's just not working out.

30
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,133
Not working out ?

31
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:12,133
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
Let you go-- as our friend.

32
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,501
You're just too...

33
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,300
Lame.
Lame, yes.

34
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,501
But i can get better.

35
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,400
Butters, you just don't really
Fit in with us here.

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,601
We think it's best
For all of us

37
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,133
If you look for friendship
Opportunities elsewhere.

38
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,467
But we certainly want to thank
You for all your hard work

39
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:25,667
And attempts at
Being our friend.

40
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,934
Lame as they were.

41
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:29,000
But i thought we were really
Getting along great.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,701
I thought we were really
Having fun together.

43
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:32,267
Yes, well, we weren't.

44
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,767
Please, fellas,
Don't fire me.

45
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,534
We're sorry, butters,
Our mind is made up.

46
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:40,534
But we certainly want to
Thank you for coming by.

47
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,067
You know your way out, right ?

48
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,467
Phew !
Whew !

49
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:55,067
He took that
Pretty well i think.

50
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:55,968
Who cares ?

51
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,033
So let's get started
On who's gonna be

52
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,667
The new person to
Take kenny's place.

53
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:08,701
The world isn't fair.

54
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,701
I do everything
People ask me to.

55
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,033
I stand in the
Lunch lines for them...

56
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,767
I buy tampons at
The store for them...

57
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:17,501
I go on maury povich with
Balls on my chin for them.

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,300
And yet,
Nobody accepts me.

59
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,534
I am an outcast--

60
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:27,567
A shadow of a man who can find
No companionship,

61
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,234
No love from others.

62
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,367
Fine !

63
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,734
If i'm to be
An outcast, so be it.

64
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,133
I'm through doing what
Others tell me to do,

65
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,601
And i am sick of this world
And the stinky people in it.

66
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,734
From now on,
I will dedicate my life

67
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,734
To bringing chaos to the world
That has dejected me !

68
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,267
I will become the
Greatest super-villain

69
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,033
The world has ever seen !

70
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:51,200
Where i go,
Destruction will follow !

71
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,968
Prepare, oh little town.

72
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:16,067
Prepare for the
Greatest super-villain

73
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,067
You have
Ever seen...

74
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,534
Professor chaos !

75
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,868
( mom knocks )
Butters, time for bed.

76
00:03:23,868 --> 00:03:26,167
Okay, mom.

77
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,334
Yes, sleep for now.

78
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:31,501
Tomorrow,
The chaos begins.

79
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:32,334
Ha ha...

80
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,200
Ha ha ha...

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,634
Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha !

82
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,567
Ah ha ha ha !

83
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,267
Alright, we want to thank
Everybody for coming,

84
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,267
This is a great turnout.

85
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,734
Uh, as you know, our friend
Kenny died a few months ago

86
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:49,267
And we are looking to fill
The void with a new friend.

87
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,334
You've all been selected
As possible candidates,

88
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,100
But unfortunately there is
Only room for one of you.

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,033
And so, stan and kyle and i will
Be spending the next few days

90
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,868
Going out with each one of you,
And narrowing our choices down,

91
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:00,534
Until we think we've found
The perfect friend.

92
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:01,767
Are there any questions ?

93
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:04,367
What if we don't
Want to be your friend ?

94
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:07,834
Clyde... Okay ?

95
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:11,434
Now, the first thing we have
To do is cut the list down

96
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:12,434
From 20 choices to 10.

97
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,667
And so today we will
All be going

98
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,200
To the amusement park together
To see who we want to cut.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Please keep in mind this
Will all be videotaped,

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,167
So put on your best friend faces
And may the best friend win !

101
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:27,133
Oh, and we will be needing
A $10 per person entrance fee.

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,934
Order 23 is up,
And order 24 is up.

103
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:51,601
( ding-ding )

104
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:07,467
Uh, waitress, i actually
Ordered the chicken soup.

105
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:08,701
This is minestrone.

106
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,300
Yeah, i had the
Minestrone over here.

107
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,601
Ah ha ha !
Ha ha ha haaa !

108
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,734
Ha ha ha
Ha haaa !

109
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:17,734
I am professor chaos !

110
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,400
And now this puny world
Will bow down to me !

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,267
Ha ah ha haaa !

112
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,901
( stan )
So today, we went to
The amusement park

113
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,200
With all our
Possible friends.

114
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,300
It was a really fun time,
We rode all the rides,

115
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,400
And everyone
Got along great.

116
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,734
I think the person
That stood out most

117
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,200
At the amusement park
Was jimmy.

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,300
Well, the reason i think i would
Make the perfect fourth friend

119
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,400
Is that i love
Telling jokes.

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,734
You know, who doesn't
Like to laugh ?

121
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,334
Tweek-- now there's
An interesting choice.

122
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:50,334
Tweek has a lot of qualities
That i look for in a friend.

123
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,701
What if they don't
Pick me ?

124
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,033
What if they
Get us all, man ?

125
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,868
I mean, christ, if they can
Get to the pentagon

126
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:57,300
They can get
To us all, man !

127
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,534
Aaagh !

128
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:00,033
I think i deserve to take
Kenny's place the most,

129
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,367
Because i've been hanging around
These guys for like, five years

130
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,501
And i never get
To say or do anything.

131
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,033
Yeah, i've always
Seen that kid in class,

132
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,701
But he never does anything,
He's more like a prop.

133
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,667
Towelie is a tough choice,
Because even though i can see

134
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,434
How always having a towel around
Could come in handy,

135
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:13,901
He's just always so high.

136
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:15,234
Yeah, i really hope
I win because--

137
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,434
Wait, what is this again ?

138
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,601
I have no idea
What's going on.

139
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,267
We decided to get some
One-on-one time with jimmy

140
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,601
And ride the log ride.

141
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:24,734
And the great thing was that
Because jimmy's crippled

142
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,734
We got to go to
The front of the line.

143
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:29,667
That was definitely big points
For jimmy, y'know.

144
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,167
But then, we get to
The ride itself and...

145
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,167
Hey, i'm gonna need some help
Getting in the log, fellas.

146
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,367
Oh, shut her down,
Someone needs assistance.

147
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,534
Oh, really ?

148
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:40,000
That's gonna
Cost some points.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,801
But right now i'd say if we're
Gonna have a retard for a friend

150
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,968
I'd have to pick timmy,

151
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,167
Because timmy doesn't
Tell lame jokes.

152
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,834
( jimmy )
Boy, isn't this
Great, fellas ?

153
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,667
Are we great pals
Or what ?

154
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,934
( kyle )
One thing's for sure,

155
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,200
Picking our new friend
Isn't gonna be easy.

156
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,534
Kneel !

157
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,267
Kneel before
Professor chaos !

158
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:06,734
Ha ha, ha ha ha !

159
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,667
Ahh ha ha haa !
Ha ha haaa !

160
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,701
Hee ha ha ha haa !

161
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,601
Oh, the look on their faces
When they got the wrong soup !

162
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,133
I love bringing chaos !

163
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:21,567
Ha !

164
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,567
Ha ha haa !

165
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,434
And that is only
The beginning.

166
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:25,167
Ha ha ha,
Ha ha ha haa !!

167
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,901
Alright, everyone,
It was a tough decision

168
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:32,767
But based on our time with you
All at the amusement park,

169
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,267
We have whittled our
Choices down to 10.

170
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,501
If you receive a rose,
Please stay.

171
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:37,834
If you don't, please
Get the fudge out.

172
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,367
Kyle, will you announce the
People we want to stay ?

173
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,400
Token...

174
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,434
Clyde...

175
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:45,334
Craig...

176
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,434
Timmy...

177
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,501
Timmy !

178
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,200
Oh, man, this is
Too much pressure !

179
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,434
Pip...

180
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,400
Jimmy...

181
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,267
Jason...

182
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,467
Towelie...

183
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,133
Louigi.

184
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:05,334
Just one rose left, kyle,
Who does it go to ?

185
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:06,234
Tweek.

186
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:07,701
Aah !

187
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:08,901
Alright, the rest of you,
Thanks for coming,

188
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,167
Get the fudge out.

189
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,000
( groans )

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,834
I didn't make the cut ?

191
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,133
Oh god, i didn't
Make the cut ?

192
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,334
I didn't even get a chance
To have them get to know me.

193
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,634
Alright, congratulations to
Those of you selected to stay.

194
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:22,868
In the end, one of you
Will be the new kenny.

195
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,067
Good luck.

196
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,367
Good morning, butters.

197
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:31,534
It certainly is, mother !

198
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:32,467
Did you hear about
What's been going on ?

199
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,567
Some horrible new
Super-villain

200
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,767
Made somebody get the wrong
Soup order at <i>bennigan's.</i>

201
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,100
No, i didn't
Hear about that.

202
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
You, you didn't ?

203
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,400
Dad, could i see the
Newspaper real quick ?

204
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,701
Well, sure, butters, i was just
About to get some breakfast.

205
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,367
Nothing...

206
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,267
Nothing !

207
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:01,701
It's the liberal media,

208
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,601
They're keeping the stories
Of my deeds covered up

209
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,033
So as not to
Cause a panic.

210
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:09,067
Well then, i guess it's time
To step it up a notch !

211
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,167
( * south park segue music * )

212
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,701
Okay, next.

213
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:22,601
( * south park segue music  )

214
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,200
This looks
Pretty good.

215
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,334
Yeah, it's not bad.

216
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,501
Next.

217
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:35,667
( * south park segue music  )

218
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,334
Timmy !

219
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,367
Next.

220
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:40,501
( school bell rings )

221
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:42,734
Okay, so now we're gonna
See how you all work

222
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:44,634
As a friend
During class time.

223
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,067
Your performances will
Be judged primarily

224
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,267
On how you help us cheat
And give us answers.

225
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,434
So good luck,
Everybody !

226
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:51,100
( ms. Choksondik )
Sit down, boys.

227
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,501
Alrighty, then.

228
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,968
Alright, children,
Before we get started,

229
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,234
Has anybody seen the eraser
For the chalkboard ?

230
00:09:57,234 --> 00:10:00,000
Heh heh heh, hee !

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,767
It probably got knocked
On the floor somewhere.

232
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,801
Can you all please just look
Around your desks for it ?

233
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,667
( butters )
Yes... Look around for
Your precious eraser.

234
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:10,934
You won't find it.

235
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:12,200
That eraser
Is in my backyard,

236
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,434
Buried three feet below
The surface of the earth.

237
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:16,300
And do you even
Suspect me ?  No.

238
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Now we shall see how you all
Like your dear chalkboard

239
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Without an eraser !

240
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,601
Information that just keeps
Piling up and piling up,

241
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,367
Until your minuscule brains
Can take it no longer !

242
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,767
No ?

243
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,667
Oh well, never mind, i've got
A backup one in the desk.

244
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,801
Okay, today, children,
We're gonna learn about
Multiplying times five.

245
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,501
So !  You all think
That you can outsmart

246
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:34,934
Professor chaos, do you ?

247
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,767
Now, whenever we multiply
A number times five

248
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,033
The result is going to end
In a zero or five.

249
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,767
Ms. Choksondik ?
What is it, butters ?

250
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,601
Uh, i need to go to the
Bathroom, really bad.

251
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,133
Alright, butters, take the
Bathroom pass and go.

252
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:49,934
Okay, so for instance,
Children--

253
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:51,734
Alright i'm going to
The bathroom now.

254
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,334
If anybody needs me,
That's where i'll be.

255
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:55,167
Just go, butters.

256
00:10:55,167 --> 00:11:00,267
Okay, so for instance, five
Times one is... What, eric ?

257
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,300
Uh, what's the
Question again ?

258
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,968
Five times one.

259
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:07,367
Five times one
Is of course...

260
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,200
Five.
Five.five.

261
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,601
Five !

262
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,000
Ha ha ha haaa !

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,868
The time for fun and games
Is over, feeble-minded fools !

264
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,567
Who are you ?

265
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,400
I am professor chaos !

266
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,834
Bringer of destruction
And maker of doom !

267
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,267
Those who do not know me yet
Shall know me very soon,

268
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,300
For the hour of chaos
Is at hand !

269
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,033
Ha ha ha haaa !

270
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:32,467
Hey, that kid
Took my last eraser !

271
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,467
Come back here, kid !

272
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,701
Oh, i'm back from
The bathroom.

273
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,033
I really let one go
In there.

274
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,367
Butters did you see another
Little kid run out of here ?

275
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,434
Why yes, i did !

276
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,133
But he pushed me down
And i scraped my elbow.

277
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,868
Go on, look at it.
It's scraped, look !

278
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:48,434
Yes, go on and see
The red mark on my elbow,

279
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,000
The red mark i made myself

280
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,434
To throw you off
Professor chaos' trail !

281
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:53,667
It looks fine, butters.

282
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,200
Okay, hold on and
Stay here, children.

283
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,334
( bell rings )

284
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,133
You're such a
Fatass, cartman !

285
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,200
Oh yeah ?  Well,
You're a stupid jew !

286
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,300
Shut up, fatass !

287
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,501
Oh, uh...
You guys are dumb.

288
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:12,434
Okay, craig,
Interesting choice.

289
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,934
Powerful stuff there, craig,
Thank you very much.

290
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,200
It is almost complete--

291
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,334
The creation of my minions
Who will assist me

292
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:23,167
In bringing terror
To the world.

293
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,133
There we go.

294
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:30,033
Yes, my minions of chaos.

295
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,033
( squeaking )

296
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:32,734
Shh.

297
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:34,100
Not now, my lovelies,

298
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,067
Your time to bring destruction
Will come very soon.

299
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,200
Aah !

300
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,501
Butters, a note for you
Was left on the front door.

301
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:41,367
A note ?

302
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:42,601
Here you go.

303
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:43,267
And wash your hands after
You touch those hamsters,

304
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,334
You'll get aids.

305
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:48,033
Okay, mom.

306
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,701
So, someone has discovered
My horrible secret.

307
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:00,968
This could be a trap
Set by the f.b.i.

308
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:03,467
Oh, i'll be at the docks,
Precious f.b.i.,

309
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,834
But it is i who will have
The trap set for you !

310
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,934
Come, my minions,
We haven't much time.

311
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:11,467
Alright everyone,
The time has come for us

312
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,801
To narrow the list down
From 10 to six.

313
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,067
But first, let us just say that
The people who we didn't pick

314
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,367
Were only not picked because
They totally suck balls-- kyle ?

315
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,400
They're not
Going to pick me.

316
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,601
I just know they're not.

317
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,133
Oh jesus !
I can't take it !

318
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:23,467
Token.

319
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,267
Alright !

320
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:25,801
Timmy.

321
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:26,367
Timmy !

322
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,267
Tweek...

323
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,467
Pip.

324
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,334
Really ?
I don't believe it !

325
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,868
Towelie.

326
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:34,834
What ?

327
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:35,334
Just one more
Rose, kyle.

328
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:36,267
Jimmy.

329
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,501
Oh boy !
Oh thank god !

330
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,868
Alright, those with
Roses will move on

331
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,534
To the swimsuit and
Talent competition.

332
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:45,200
The rest of you--
Get the fudge out !

333
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:46,534
This whole thing is stupid !

334
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,567
You don't pick people
You wanna be with

335
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,868
By making it into a game !

336
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,167
Eww, somebody's
A sore loser !

337
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:54,000
Clyde, i believe i said
Get the fudge out,

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,067
Which means kiss my fudgen'
Ass, go fudge yourself,

339
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,534
Would ya get the
Fudge out, clyde ?

340
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,300
Hey, butters.

341
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,667
Oh, hey, dougie--
I mean--

342
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,100
My name is professor chaos !

343
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,367
I saw you change
In the school bathroom.

344
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,567
You stole that eraser
In your class.

345
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,767
Very well !

346
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,000
You called out
Professor chaos,

347
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,234
And you also called out
Your own demise !

348
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:23,501
Go now, my minions !

349
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:26,167
Go and take this
Foolish mortal down !

350
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,067
Aw, minions,
Not that way.

351
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,167
Come back, minions.

352
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm not trying to call you
Out-- professor chaos.

353
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,100
I want to join you.

354
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,934
Join me ?

355
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:37,400
Yeah, i want to join you in
Your conquest of destruction.

356
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,534
But why ?

357
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:39,868
I'm an outcast too--

358
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,767
A frail child
Cast aside by society.

359
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to follow you and--
Whatever you're doing.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,133
Very well, you shall be
My accomplice in evil.

361
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,701
Together, we shall bring
The world to its knees

362
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:53,267
And make all those who banished
Us from society run wrecked.

363
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,567
Do i get a neat-o costume made
Out of aluminum foil too ?

364
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:56,667
Well, sure you do.

365
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:59,400
I am professor and
You shall be my general.

366
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,234
From now on you are
General... Disarray.

367
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,334
General disarray.

368
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,000
Now let us go look
For my minions !

369
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,601
Because they ran away...

370
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,234
The swimsuit competition
Really gave us a fresh look

371
00:15:16,234 --> 00:15:18,267
At some of the candidates.

372
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, i don't think
I did too well

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,434
In the bathing suit
Competition.

374
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,434
But i can't wait for the
Talent show competition.

375
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:27,234
That'll really be my chance
To... Shine.

376
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,033
Wow, what a
Terrific audience.

377
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:31,234
So anyway,
A guy walks into a b...

378
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,901
A guy walks
Into a b...

379
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:36,834
A guy walks,
A guys walk into a b-b...

380
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:41,067
( struggling to play intro
To "stairway to heaven" )

381
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,267
Okay, wait.

382
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,534
No, no, wait.

383
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,200
Next, please.

384
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
What am i supposed to do ?

385
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,167
Anything that'll
Impress us, token.

386
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,434
If you were our friend,

387
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,968
How would you keep us
Entertained ?

388
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,467
Uh... Oh, i know !

389
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,167
Very nice.

390
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,667
I like it.

391
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,067
Token was the definite winner
Of the talent show.

392
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,701
But then we decided to take
Everyone to a baseball game,

393
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:14,767
To see how we
Got along there.

394
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:15,634
( announcer )
There goes a hit to left field !

395
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,400
And foley's going to score !

396
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,567
Woo-hoo !

397
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,801
Yeah !
Isn't this great ?

398
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:20,868
Drinks !
Get your drinks here !

399
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:22,634
Yes, could i have
Some tea, please ?

400
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,467
You don't drink tea
At a baseball game,

401
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,634
You french
Piece of crap !

402
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:26,667
Oh, very well--

403
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:27,734
Just some
Crumpets then.

404
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:28,868
Alright,
That does it !

405
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:29,367
Pip, get the
Fudge out !

406
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,667
Next !

407
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,934
Okay, let's try this.

408
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,267
Hey, what's wrong
With the jumbotron ?

409
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,934
People of earth !

410
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,300
Your meaningless lives
Are about to end !

411
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,100
I am professor chaos

412
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,033
And this is my partner in evil,
General disarray.

413
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:49,567
In the past few days i have
Rained terror down

414
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,234
Upon the society
That shunned me,

415
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:54,968
And now it is time for
My final labor of loathing.

416
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:58,701
I am going to--
Flood the world !

417
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,434
Flood the world !
My god !

418
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:02,767
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die !

419
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:05,701
Oh yes, every living creature
And every sacred building

420
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:09,868
Will soon be under leagues and
Leagues of cold and dark water !

421
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:11,901
And there is nothing
You can do to stop it !

422
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:15,467
General disarray, begin
The flooding of earth !

423
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,767
You brought this
Upon yourselves !

424
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,133
You made the outcasts
Of the world.

425
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:27,000
Now watch, watch as your
Precious planet drowns !

426
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,701
Watch !

427
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,868
Dear christ,
Who will save us ?

428
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,000
We have very little
Time to live.

429
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,701
How shall we spend our
Last hours on earth ?

430
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,334
Our reign of terror
Is complete !

431
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,501
The turmoil has now
Come full circle !

432
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,200
Hey, is that hose on full,
General disarray ?

433
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,467
It's on all the way.

434
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,534
Oh, alright then.

435
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:04,133
Nothing to do now but
Watch the world die !

436
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,367
Ha, ha ha haaa !

437
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,000
Ha ha haa !

438
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:16,200
Boy, this sure is
Taking a long time.

439
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:21,734
Okay, so how do
We all feel

440
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,634
About towelie
As our new friend ?

441
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,100
I think
Towelie's awesome.

442
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,834
Towelie's cool, but he gets
Stoned all the time.

443
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,434
You can't really
Rely on him for anything.

444
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:28,300
Ugh, this is giving me
A headache.

445
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,334
Now come on, you guys,

446
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,434
We can't take this
Decision lightly.

447
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,601
Whoever we pick
Is going to be the person

448
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,100
We do everything with
From now on.

449
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,701
You're right.

450
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,100
Well, how about timmy ?

451
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,501
He's quiet and he takes
Direction well.

452
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:38,868
Really, the perfect friend.

453
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,300
Yeah, but timmy can be
Really self-centered.

454
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,701
How about token ?

455
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,701
Token's a smartass.

456
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:43,834
So,
You're a smartass.

457
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,267
Yeah, but do we really
Need another one ?

458
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:46,367
Good point.

459
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,634
Hey, fellas, i was just
In the neighborhood,

460
00:18:48,634 --> 00:18:50,968
And thought i'd stop by
This gift basket.

461
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:51,934
Oh, thanks, jimmy.

462
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:54,000
There's some chocolates
And licorice

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,200
And some games
And puzzles inside.

464
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,601
That's great.
Cool.

465
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,634
Yeah, well, i guess i'll be
Seeing you friends later.

466
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,968
Alright, jimmy,
See ya.

467
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,167
Suck up.

468
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,701
Not long now,
General disarray,

469
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:15,167
And our horrible plan
Will be complete.

470
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,033
Hey, do you think maybe
We should build a boat ?

471
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,734
You know, like,
A little raft or something

472
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:21,734
So that when
The world floods,

473
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:24,000
You and me and
The minions can live ?

474
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,767
Oh yeah, i hadn't
Thought of that.

475
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:26,534
That's a pretty good idea.

476
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:29,567
I'll go get a hammer.

477
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,667
Hey, who is that ?

478
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,434
Is this it ?

479
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:44,100
Yeah, 213,
That's the one.

480
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,200
Hey, what are you doin' ?

481
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,200
Ah !  You may have
Won this time,

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,934
But i will be back !

483
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,100
What do we do now ?

484
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,033
Well, i had another idea
Of how to kill the world.

485
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:08,968
I thought it was almost too
Horrible to even speak of,

486
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:12,601
But now they've left me
With no other choice !

487
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,200
Well, this is it.

488
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,601
We've made our final decision,
And one of you,

489
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,334
Is who we will spending
Our childhood with,

490
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,467
As our new friend.

491
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,334
Oh please...
Oh god, please.

492
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:24,701
Four friends,
Just one rose.

493
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,434
The moment of truth
Is here.

494
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,601
Kyle, who does
The rose go to ?

495
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,434
This is it,
General disarray--

496
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,734
My final solution.

497
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,300
What evil plot do you have
This time, professor chaos ?

498
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Simple, my dear general.

499
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,701
We are going to tear down the
Earth's precious atmosphere !

500
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,167
Oh yes, my latest plan
Will melt the polar ice caps

501
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:51,133
And burn all the world
With the sun's harmful rays.

502
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,434
Say good-bye to your precious
Ozone and hello to chaos !

503
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,801
( pssssssssssss )

504
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08,133
Okay, hand me another one,
General disarray.

505
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,234
Ah ha ha,
Ha ha haa.

506
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:11,334
Ha ha ha !

507
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,567
Haa ha ha ha haa !

508
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:13,968
Ah ha ha,
Ha ha ha.

509
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,834
Ha ha, ha haa !

510
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,000
( announcer )
Will professor chaos'
Latest plot succeed

511
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,033
And be the final
Undoing of earth ?

512
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:24,734
And which boy has been chosen to
Be the replacement for kenny ?

513
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,501
And which one of these six
South park residents was killed

514
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,968
And will never be seen again ?

515
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:33,834
The answer to these questions
Will be answered... Right now.

516
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,567
No.
Tweek.
Ms. Choksondik.
