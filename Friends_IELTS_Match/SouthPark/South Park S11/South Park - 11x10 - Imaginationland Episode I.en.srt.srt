<i>I'm heading out to south park

<i>Episode 11x10
"Imaginationland"</i>

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,460
All right, let's try over here.

11
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:43,016
Set up traps there, and there as well. Last
time I saw him he ran right through here.

12
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:47,481
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got
everyone believing your stupid story.

13
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:51,022
It isn't a story, it's true!
I saw a leprechaun.

14
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:53,893
I've seen him come through here
three days in a row now.

15
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:58,290
Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
- This is Hawk Eyes.

16
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:00,621
We've set up the net and we're standing by.

17
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:03,920
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance
tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out.

18
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:06,880
Just admit you were lying, Cartman,
so that everyone can go home!

19
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,901
O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle!

20
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,382
If I can prove there's a leprechain,
you have to suck my balls, remember?!

21
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:15,532
Dragon Wind to Blackie:
What's your six, Blackie?

22
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:19,720
I don't want the code name Blackie.

23
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:22,970
Code names are what they are, Blackie!
Check your six and alert when in position!

24
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:26,122
This is fucking retarded!
- Hah, getting nervous, Kyle?

25
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,343
When that leprechaus shows up
you must suck my balls!

26
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,441
Don't forget I have a signed contract
from you.

27
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:33,680
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was
a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars!

28
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:36,002
Now just pay up and stop being stupid!

29
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:40,123
Goddamnit, why hasn't it shown up yet?
Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!

30
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:43,843
This is faggot. Go ahead.

31
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:47,170
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance
North to North East. Check back in five.

32
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:50,290
Okay, will do. Faggot out.

33
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:54,030
Okay, that's enough. Everybody!

34
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:56,622
Cartman is just pulling one of his
stupid tricks on everyone.

35
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,612
Because he's trying to get out
of a deal he made!

36
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:01,750
It was here, I swear it! I don't know
why it's not showing up this time!

37
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:05,401
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you
could prove it, I had to suck your balls,

38
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:08,982
but if you couldn't, you had to pay
me ten dollars! Pay up!

39
00:02:09,686 --> 00:02:12,232
Uh, I got something! I got it!

40
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:17,490
It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
- Set off diversion track C!

41
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:27,290
Dude...
- Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.

42
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,291
Get it!

43
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:33,413
Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive!

44
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:49,551
Wow.
- Uh, move aside! Move aside!

45
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,171
All right, butthole, where's the gold?!

46
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,473
You lads don't know what you're doing.
I need to deliver an important message!

47
00:02:57,498 --> 00:03:02,400
There's going to be an attack!
- Tell me where the gold is or you die! Slow!

48
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,013
Where'd he go?

49
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,951
I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack,
but you boys have made me late.

50
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:14,093
Now the terrorists will prevail!
The end is near!

51
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,871
Dude.

52
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:23,830
Kyle, suck my balls.

53
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:35,130
<i>Kyle sucks Cartman's balls</i>

54
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:40,401
<i>The trilogy</i>

55
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:56,062
Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
- From Ireland.

56
00:03:56,326 --> 00:04:00,282
So... why would one come to America
to warn us about a terrorist attack.

57
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,842
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real.

58
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:07,581
You're almost 9 now, you need to understand
the difference beween real and imaginary.

59
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:09,581
I thought I did.

60
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:19,082
Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
- Oh, hello Eric. Kyle, your friend is here.

61
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:22,302
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike.
Nice evening, isn't it?

62
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,630
Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room
for a few minutes.

63
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:27,962
Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!

64
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:32,180
Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed
to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.

65
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,471
I'm not doing it, fatass!
- Doing what?

66
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:37,311
We had a deal, Kyle!
- Just get out of here!

67
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:41,812
You signed an agreement, Kyle!
- I don't care if I signed an agreement!

68
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:45,662
Hey now Kyle, if you made a deal
with somebody, you have to stick by it.

69
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:49,510
Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
- What was the agreement?

70
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,492
That if he could prove leprechauns exist,
I would suck his balls.

71
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:56,412
And there was a leprechaun!
You saw it, Kyle!

72
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:00,943
Hey dudes.

73
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,102
Hey Kyle.

74
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:06,750
So, how was it?
- How was what?

75
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:09,002
Sucking Cartman's b-balls.

76
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:12,113
I didn't suck his balls, all right?!
And and I'm not going to!

77
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:14,710
Dude, why did you ever agree to suck
his balls in the first place.

78
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:18,330
I didn't think there would actually be
a leprechaun! And I still don't!

79
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,292
Why would a leprechaun be warning us
of a terrorist attack?!

80
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:24,631
There's another explanation for all this.
- Excuse me.

81
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:28,061
Have you boys seen a leprechaun
anywhere lately?

82
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:32,410
What do you know about the leprechaun?
- Oh, then you did see him.

83
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:36,330
That's wontiferous!
I want you to tell me everything he said.

84
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:39,403
Where was he? What was he doing?
- All right I've had enough!

85
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:43,071
Leprechauns are imaginary!
- Well of course they are.

86
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:47,741
But just because they're imaginary,
doesn't mean they're not real.

87
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:51,323
Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?

88
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:54,113
You young man!
How would you like to be a cowboy?

89
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:56,861
Or a swashbuckling pirate?

90
00:05:56,897 --> 00:06:01,231
And you! How would you like to be
an astronaut, far out in space?

91
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:04,061
All it takes is a little... imagination.

92
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:09,031
Who the hell are you?
- Still not convinced, eh?

93
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:15,132
I tell you what, boys. What say we all take
a ride on my Imagination Flying Machine?

94
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:19,652
Dude.

95
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:23,261
Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.

96
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:26,413
Uh, are you gonna rap us?

97
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:31,333
No?

98
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,771
Ah all right then.
- Come on, guys.

99
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:38,150
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure
this guy wants to rape us.

100
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:41,592
All aboard the Imagination Balloon!

101
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:50,640
Some people feel imagination isn't real,
but I tell them that they're wrong.

102
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:54,631
Because whenever I want to play
and pretend, I just sing...

103
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:58,790
the Imagination Song.

104
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,580
Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!

105
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:58,321
But my boy, we're already here.

106
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:20,762
What is this place?
- This is Imaginationland.

107
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:24,920
It's where all the wonderful and goofy things
that humans have made up over the years....

108
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,702
live together.

109
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:44,410
Citizens of Imaginationland! We have
distinguished guests from the world beyond!

110
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:47,573
Hello.

111
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:54,060
Welcome to Imaginationland.
I am the Lollipop King.

112
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:57,660
We are honored to have Creators
in our kingdom.

113
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:02,722
Now, good news, everyone!
These boys did see the leprechaun!

114
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:07,872
What did he tell you? Did he have any news?

115
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:11,503
Well he said there was gonna be a-

116
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,061
...that there was gonna be a-

117
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,271
Allah!

118
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:19,371
Oh fuck, no!

119
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:05,022
Stan, we have to get out of here!

120
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:10,552
Quickly boys! Get on my back!

121
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,112
Fellas! Fellas wait!
Hold on, fellas!

122
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:20,791
Butters.
- Don't leave me, fellas! Come back!

123
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:24,362
Dude!

124
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:28,573
Hey guys!
- Goodbye Butters.

125
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:38,060
Where...? Oh. Oh dude.

126
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:42,330
Oh, it was just a dream.
It was all just a crazy dream.

127
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:44,903
Oh my God.

128
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,773
Hello?
- Dude, did you finish your math homework?

129
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:57,363
I kind of lost track of time last night.
- No, I hardly got any sleep.

130
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:00,963
I had this whole messed up dream about some
gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland

131
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,480
where all these imaginary characters lived.

132
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,350
And then it got attacked by terrorists?

133
00:11:07,386 --> 00:11:10,411
Yeah! How'd you know?
- Dude! I had the same dream!

134
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:13,253
We jumped on a dragon's back
and Butters got left behind!

135
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,311
Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen
your little friend Butters, have you?

136
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:18,392
Why?

137
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:21,650
Our darling Butters never came home last night.

138
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:24,762
What did they say?
- We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but...

139
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:28,263
we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped
Butters, sodomized him over and over again

140
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:30,710
and then fed his genitals to wild animals.

141
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,922
There there, darling.

142
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:35,983
Dude.

143
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:45,880
Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news.
Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours,

144
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:50,006
terrorists successfully attacked...
our imagination.

145
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,691
Our imagnation?
- How?

146
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:57,812
The imaginary attack appears to have
been in the works for years.

147
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:02,002
The effects of the attack are
so far unimaginable.

148
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:05,830
We've intercepted this videotape
the terrorists made for broadcast.

149
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:09,102
Luckily we've kept it from
being broadcast to the public.

150
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:17,303
No! It's just a Care Bear!

151
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:20,622
Oh my God.

152
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:26,521
Later in the video we can see another imaginary
hostage, this one reading a forced statement.

153
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:31,801
Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace
and will have brought forth this day.

154
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:34,673
Oh jeez!

155
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:42,090
Now see, your safety is at our whim.
This is the price you pay, America!

156
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:46,810
You have defiled Allah, and now we
will turn your imagination against you!

157
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:48,910
Death to the Infidels!

158
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,162
Can I go now?

159
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:55,291
Stan! Kyle!
Could you could you get me out of here?

160
00:12:56,466 --> 00:13:01,490
Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have
complete control of our imagination.

161
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:07,032
It's only a matter of time before
our imaginations start running wild.

162
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:12,773
I believe a serious blow to democracy
has just been dealt.

163
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:15,623
A travesty has occurred and I want justice!

164
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:20,081
Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly
sign a contract, and yet, to date,

165
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:25,102
he has made no effort, nor does he show
any intention, of ever sucking my balls!

166
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:29,740
I've given him ample time to fulfill
his obligation and he has thus refused.

167
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,603
I stand before you with dry balls,
your Honor.

168
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:36,501
I've provided witnesses, collected
testimonials and still, my balls remain dry.

169
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:38,442
I want what I'm entitled to!

170
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:45,993
Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally
imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?

171
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:49,033
I...

172
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:53,063
Is this not your signature on the contract?

173
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:03,051
Come, come on! Really? I mean, aren't there
more important things going on right now?

174
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,443
From what I've been presented
and the evidence put forth,

175
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:09,732
the court has no choice but to order you to
place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth

176
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:13,373
and draw upon it succulently for
no less than 30 seconds.

177
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:14,580
Yes!

178
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:18,293
You have twenty four hours to suck
aforementioned balls.

179
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:22,261
If after that time you still refuse, the court
will be forced to arrest you for contempt.

180
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:23,762
Next case!

181
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:28,910
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for
me, this is a victory for the justice system.

182
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:30,361
And my balls.

183
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:35,920
What I am about to tell you
is highly classified.

184
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:40,842
Two days ago, Muslim terrorists
hijacked our imagination.

185
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:44,360
Frankly we don't know what their
next move is or how to stop them.

186
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:47,940
In times like these the government
often turns to Hollywood for help.

187
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:51,002
You creative filmmakers can think
of idea's we just can't.

188
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:54,660
That's why we've asked you here,
M. Night Shyal-amalam.

189
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:58,233
The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village,
all very clever films.

190
00:14:58,268 --> 00:15:03,123
But can you use your amazing idea brain
now to help us stop the terrorists?

191
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,231
What if...

192
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:09,051
What if it turns out they aren't terrorists?

193
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:12,190
But they're actually werewolves?
From the future?

194
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:17,131
No. No, they're terrorists.
They've been linked to Al Qaeda.

195
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:22,191
But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out,
is the group being terrorized? By aliens?

196
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:27,741
No, no. That's not an idea,
that's a twist. We need ideas.

197
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:30,643
How about we make everyone
think that terrorists attacked us?

198
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,391
But really, we were all already dead.

199
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:35,702
Get him out of here.

200
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:41,840
Mr. Bay, can you thnk of any idea how
to outwit these terrorists?

201
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:48,350
I believe I can. We start by making a big CG
building and then we have a meteor go, crosh!

202
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,462
And it's all like, crawl.

203
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:53,782
And motorcycles burst into flame while
they jump over these helicopters, right?

204
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,680
No, no! We need ideas how
to stop the terrorists!

205
00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:01,322
An eighteen-wheeler spins
out of control and it's all like, brosh.

206
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:05,512
And then this huge tanker full of dyna-

207
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,203
Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!

208
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,760
I don't understand the difference.
- I know you don't. Get him out of here!

209
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:21,702
And being that we are all big Mel Gibson film
fans, we thought maybe you could help us.

210
00:16:21,736 --> 00:16:25,820
Ah, my nipples, they hurt!
They hurt when I twist them!

211
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:32,353
Yes, I don't suppose you have any
creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?

212
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:36,653
How about this? You have that tape
that the terrorists made, right?

213
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,961
Well maybe if you did a background
check on that videotape,

214
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:45,991
you might find somebody who doesn't belong.
Somebody who doesn't fit Imaginationland.

215
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:50,431
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

216
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:54,803
Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson,
but the sonofabitch knows story structure.

217
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:58,463
Get the videotape and do
a background check on everyone in it!

218
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,432
Yes!

219
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:03,943
All the imaginary characters
in the tape were identified, sir.

220
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:08,020
Count Chocula, Cinderella,
Snarf from Thundercats, but here...

221
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:14,090
Nothing in American folklore or storytalling
match this kid. He appears to be just some kid.

222
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:17,680
Stan! Kyle! Could you,
could you get me out of here?

223
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:21,592
I want digital imaging
and resource magnification done stat!

224
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:26,152
If that kid isn't imaginary I want to know who
he is, where he's from and who his friends are!

225
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:27,510
Yes sir!

226
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,820
Who are you?

227
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,960
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?

228
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:46,873
Uh, I'm actually not imaginary and my parents
are gonna ground me if I don't get back-

229
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:51,252
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

230
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:57,552
Can you tell what the terrorists are doing?
- They're going something to Rockety Rocket.

231
00:17:57,596 --> 00:18:00,272
No! Leave me alone!

232
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:03,210
It doesn't make sense.
What do they want with Rockety?

233
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,741
The only reason they would-

234
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:09,931
Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!

235
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,081
What's the Barrier?
- The wall!

236
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:18,350
The wall which separates the evil side
of Imaginationland from the good side!

237
00:18:18,478 --> 00:18:22,611
No! No you can't blow up the barrier!
Are you insane?!

238
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:27,851
We can't let this happen.
- It will be the end of Imaginationland.

239
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:31,170
Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.
- Me?

240
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:34,643
What am I supposed to do?
- Don't you get it?!

241
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:38,940
If the terrorists blow that barrier,
all the most evil things ever imagined

242
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:42,291
are gonna pour out and take
over Imaginationland for good!

243
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:45,112
You have to do something!

244
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:57,002
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment
is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.

245
00:18:57,027 --> 00:19:01,893
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
- He has to. He's been ordered by the court.

246
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:05,731
Hey, he's here.
- What? Move aside, move aside!

247
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:09,453
Dude, do you really have to do it?
- Let's just get this over with!

248
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:13,801
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle
and pay homage to this sultan's balls.

249
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:15,540
Goddamnit!

250
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,732
Yes. Yes!

251
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:31,103
That's them, sir.
Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski.

252
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:34,142
You boys need to come with us on
a matter of national security.

253
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:35,051
Who are you?

254
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:38,280
There's no time!
You need to come with us right now!

255
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:39,542
Hey, let go of him!

256
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:42,252
We aren't going to hurt your little friends.
We just need information.

257
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:45,423
No! No, he has to suck my balls!

258
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:51,932
No! Kyle!

259
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:57,673
No! No!

260
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:02,063
Hold on! Hold on a second!

261
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:07,782
Now, you really should think about this.
I mean...

262
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:13,052
I know you think attacking our imagination
will get you somewhere, but will it really?

263
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:18,990
If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts
of our imagination are gonna break loose,

264
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:23,202
but will it really make you terrorists
feel better?

265
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:27,411
Maybe it's time for us all to just get along.

266
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:30,921
Allah!

267
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:35,370
Jesus Christ, no!

268
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:42,761
That was your plan to stop them?
- Yeah and that's not a heartfelt speech?

269
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:45,183
That's fucking stupid!

270
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:57,582
They are coming...

271
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:11,062
Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous
for someone your age to be hitchhiking.

272
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:15,813
Yeah well, when a man has been wronged...

273
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:20,741
he no longer cares about danger.
- You going to Washington to visit family?

274
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:25,001
I've got unfinished business. You go
through life being told there's justice,

275
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:29,533
then you learn that the only real justice...
is the justice you take.

276
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:36,200
Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over,
you will suck my balls.

277
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,502
<i>To be continued...</i>
