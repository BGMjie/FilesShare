00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:08,355
South Park - Season 11 Episode 6
"D-Yikes!"

2
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:40,008
Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up!

3
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,320
Goddamnit!

4
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,552
Stupid ass man! They're all the same!

5
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:46,332
Oh God, here we go again.

6
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:48,385
All men care about is SEX!

7
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:51,403
I spent two hours getting
ready for that stupid date!

8
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:54,186
And when the bastard checks out my body,
he just says,

9
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:56,394
"Hey, did you used
to be a guy or somethin'?"

10
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:59,205
I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!

11
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:00,711
Uh oh, this isn't good.

12
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,211
Did I say something to you, sugartits?!

13
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:04,280
No ma'am.

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,924
You boys make me sick!

15
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:08,003
You're well on your way to being men,

16
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:10,303
who only think with their penises!

17
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,042
I am assigning you all weekend homework!

18
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,116
You are going to read Hemingway's book,

19
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,292
"The Old Man And The Sea"!

20
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:19,133
Have you lost your mind?

21
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:21,373
Dude, we can't read an
entire book in one weekend.

22
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:23,302
Oh, that's too bad, dude.

23
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:26,426
Maybe if you boys could
keep your penises in your pants

24
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,399
once in a while you'd get more done!

25
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:30,766
But Teacher,
my penis never slips out of my pants.

26
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:33,139
Eh-except sometimes
when I'm wearin' pajamas.

27
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:35,638
If you do not have
an essay written on Monday,

28
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:38,288
then you will fail! Is that clear?!

29
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,278
Dude, how are supposed
to read an entire book

30
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,039
over the weekend and write an essay?

31
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:45,535
Our whole weekend is shot.

32
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,116
(What the hell are we going to do?!)

33
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,677
You guys, you guys, relax.

34
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:51,839
We don't have to read
the book or write the essay.

35
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,289
- We don't?
- No.

36
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:56,942
There's people you can
hire to do these sorts of things.

37
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,153
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?

38
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,308
Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

39
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,242
- Yeis.

40
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,778
Okay, listen up, Mexicans.
We need you to read

00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,296

43
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:16,868
Okay. Sure. Okay. Yeah.

44
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:19,069
Here. We need you to work together,

45

La samaraisia.

47
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:25,613
- Okay no problem. That's no problem.
- Yeah, we can do that.

48
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:26,865
Sí, la samuraisia.

49
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:28,815
- Okay, gracias.
- Gracias.

50
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:31,436
Dude, that is awesome.
I had no idea you could do that.

51
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:34,354
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans
around totally kicks fuckin' ass.

52
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,398
<i></i>

53
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,921
They can all rot in hell!

54
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,807
Who needs men anyway?!

55
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:44,747
They're Goddamned arrogant
self-centered assholes is what they are!

56
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,302
Are you okay, hon?

57
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:47,910
I just hate men is all.

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,630
It's like all they care
about is how hot you look!

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,496
Yeah, I've never been into men.

60
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,971
That's why I work out here.

61
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:57,133
Since it's women only we don't
get ogled at or feel self-conscious.

62
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:58,324
Tell me about it!

63
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:00,245
I can't even stretch at a normal gym

64
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:03,134
without some guy trying
to stare down my vage.

65
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:04,692
I'm Allyson.

66
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,749
Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison.

67
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,299
Sorry I'm so pissed off.

68
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,684
No, I like it.

69
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,575
You seem like a very strong woman.

70
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,928
Yeah, I've been told that.

71
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:16,609
How come I've never seen
you down at the girl bar?

72
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:19,213
Girl bar? I never even
knew there was such a place.

73
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:21,254
Oh you'd love it.
It's the only bar in town

74
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:24,266
where women like us can
hang out and be ourselves.

75
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:26,066
It's called "Les Bos."

76
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:32,762
Hi Linda, hi Kate.

77
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,065
Hey Allyson.

78
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:35,749
Who's the new girl?

79
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,617
Allyson always goes for the butch ones.

80
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:40,972
Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?

81
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,769
Oowhat a great place.

82
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,000
All the girls here
seem to know each other.

83
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,088
Yeah. Well, most of the
girls here have done each other.

84
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,547
He-yeah. Done what?

85
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,597
You know. Had sex.

86
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:58,092
Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar??

87
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,911
Yeah. I... thought you understood that.

88
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,855
Oh jeez.

89
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:06,219
I'm sorry. I thought you
knew what "girl bar" meant.

90
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,448
But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa.

91
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:13,436
Janet, I'm really sorry.
It's just that at the gym

92
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,197
you said you didn't like being with men,
so I thought you were a-

93
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:17,729
I don't like being with men!

94
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,079
They're perverted selfish pigs!

95
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:27,009
Have you... never even... thought...
of being... with another woman?

96
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,135
Oho goodness no!

97
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,556
Of course I haven't.

98
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,469
I mean... really I don't even understand

99
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,319
how two women can make love.

100
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:41,134
I mean un, unless they
just kinda scissor or something.

101
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,966
There are a lot of
ways to make love, Janet.

102
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,206
I guess I'd be lying

103
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:48,674
if I said I wasn't
a little ...titillated.

104
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,584
Could I... maybe kiss you?

105
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,679
Oh, this is wrong!

106
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,329
You're another woman;
it doesn't make sense!

107
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,969
Is it wrong, Janet?
Let your inhibitions go.

108
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,671
Let's just have fun tonight.

109
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,071
No commitments. Just fun.

110
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,543
Oh yeah, scissor!

111
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:22,225
Yeah, scissor me Allyson!

112
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,233
Janet, you're crazy!

113
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,158
Oh, this is hot scissoring!

114
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,756
Ohh! Scissor me timbers!

115
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,822
They'd better be done
with the book reports!

116
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,570
School starts in 15 minutes!

117
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,020
They'll be done.

118
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,575
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?

119
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:42,256
All right, did you read the book?

120
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:43,358
- Sí
- Sí.

121
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:45,836
What was it about?
Ih-in case our teacher asks us.

122
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:48,701
Eet starts there the old man,

123
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:51,750
and his job is to catch the feesh,

124
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,906
so he get in the boht,
to try and catch feesh.

125
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,717
Saw he catch the feesh,
but the feesh is very strong,

126
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:02,854
so the old man,
cannot reel in the feesh.

127
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,062
So then he fight the feesh. Some more.

128
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,446
And he finally catch the feesh.

129
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,806
He catches the feesh so,
then he can make money.

130
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,306
No, because on the way home,

131
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:17,112
the sharks come and eat the feesh.

132
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:20,579
And so, he no make money.

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,438
That's it, that's the whole story?

134
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,238
Sí.

135
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:27,152
All right,
did you write the four essays?

136
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,048
Sí, we all wrote eses for you.

137
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,448
- All right!
- Okay, let's have 'em.

138
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:33,545
Have what?

139
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:35,579
You said you all wrote essays.

140
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,879
Where are they?

141
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,157
Well, my ese lives in Miami.

142
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:40,807
I wrote to him like you said,

143
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,849
but I don't think he got the letter yet.

144
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,707
I wrote my ese in Albuquerque

145
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:46,442
I wrote three eses:

146
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:49,119
my ese back home, my ese in Denver,

147
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:51,679
and my ese in Glenwood
even wrote me back.

148
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,029
"Thanks for writing me, ese."

149
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,110
(Uh oh...)

150
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,493
Dude, we're totally fucked now!

151
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,707
Why the hell would we
pay you to write your friends?!

152
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,432
We thought it was kind of strange.

153
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,745
This is your fault, Cartman!
Now we're gonna fail!

154
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:06,586
You guys, school starts in ten minutes!

155
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:07,843
Son of a bitch!

156
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,132
Clyde? Clyde! Hey hey Clyde!

157
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,152
You didn't finish
your essay either, right?

158
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,134
No, I got it done.

159
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:18,838
Jimmy, did you finish your book report?

160
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,561
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it.
I finished my whole book report

161
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:23,644
and, I got a really
nice letter from my ese

162
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,637
who works down at the U-Haul.

163
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,752
- Crap!
- We're dead.

164
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:31,622
Hello, class.

165
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:33,522
Here's my little desk,

166
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,383
my nice lil' chalkboard ...

167
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,224
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports...

168
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,912
Oho, that's okay Eric.

169
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:42,799
If you need a little more
time with your homework, just say so.

170
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:43,899
Really?

171
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,734
Kids, I need to tell you something

172
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:48,084
that you might find shocking.

173
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,022
I'm gay.

174
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:53,300
Again?

175
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:55,298
It was a shock to me too.

176
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:57,611
I... met another woman and...

177
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,162
we went to this fabulous
bar called Lesbos

178
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:02,512
where I finally felt at home.

179
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,939
Allyson and I talked, and
really opened up to each other and...

180
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:09,144
then we...  scissored all night long.

181
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,940
You have to be careful with scissors.

182
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,874
But listen, I am not going to just
rush into a relationship with Allyson.

183
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:17,601
I'm a late-in-life lesbian.

184
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,277
So I need to play the
field for a while, right?

185
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:21,877
Oh I'm so happy.

186
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:22,965
That's great!

187
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:24,924
Let's hear it for
Teacher being a lesbian!

188
00:08:24,974 --> 00:08:25,974
YAY!

189
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,669
Hey Tracy, hey Kate.

190
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,022
Hi Janet.

191
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:35,585
Lookin' hot, Linda.

192
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:38,054
Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on?

193
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:38,917
Huh?

194
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:40,600
Hey Patty.

195
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,981
What's up, Janet.

196
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:44,272
Ooo, stop giving me that look.

197
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,714
Scissoring me with your eyes.

198
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:50,707
Hey Janet,
why don't you pick up on your own girl?

199
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,083
Oh yeah, dyke fight!

200
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:05,476
You kicked me right in the pussy!

201
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:13,893
Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring.
Oh yeah, scissor!

202
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,887
You guys. You guys, stop it.

203
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,594
Listen to me, everybody.

204
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,344
I got some bad news.

205
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,026
What is it, Katie?

206
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,697
They're closing down the bar. For good!

207
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,870
Closing it down? They can't do that.

208
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,426
This is our home.

209
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,914
Yeah, this is our home.

210
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,566
Well it's true,
I just talked to the owners.

211
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,823
They've sold the bar to Persians.

212
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,902
Persians?!

213
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:43,992
So where are we supposed to go?

214
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,682
We aren't going anywhere!

215
00:09:45,732 --> 00:09:47,538
We have a history here!

216
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:52,443
Persians are closing this
bar over my dead lesbian body!

217
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:57,659
Mayor, this is an outrage!

218
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:00,971
We are being discriminated
against as lesbians!

219
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,215
You're a lesbian now?

220
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,904
That's right. A proud lesbian!

221
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:09,140
And our home is being taken away!

222
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,490
The bar has been sold
to Persian club owners.

223
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,392
I don't know what you
want me to do about it.

224
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:14,916
Forbid the transaction!

225
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,116
This is happening all
over the country, Mayor.

226
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,533
Lesbian bars being bought out,
shut down, it isn't right!

227
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,895
Yeah, that's right!

228
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,881
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied.

229
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,535
The new owners plan to start
redecorating the bar tomorrow.

230
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,435
You have to be out by then.

231
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,357
Have you seen how Persians decorate?

232
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:38,068
They will cover that bar in
cheesy blue carpeting, white statues

233
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:41,768
and gold curtain rods to the
point that you will want to puke!

234
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,785
Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.

235
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:51,756
Well, here's to some
great times at this place.

236
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:55,954
Yeah. Guess we'll just have
to find somewhere else to hang out.

237
00:10:56,848 --> 00:11:01,537
Now, come on gals ! I can't believe what
I'm hearing ! We can't just give up !

238
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:05,085
- What are we supposed to do, Janet?
- We stand and fight!

239
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:09,278
When the Persians come we
tell them "We aren't leaving Lesbos."

240
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:11,328
Actually, it's "Les Bos."

241
00:11:11,996 --> 00:11:14,364
No, it's Lesbos!

242
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,386
We... are Lesbos!

243
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:20,756
And as Lesbos,
we cannot just stand and watch

244
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,785
as one girl bar after
another gets shut dowwwwwn!

245
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:27,835
The Persians have sent
somebody to talk to us.

246
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,905
Hello, my name is Emir Hadi.

247
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:34,188
My boss sent me over here
because he heard that you were upset

248
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:36,830
about us trying to take over the bar.

249
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,093
- Yes, we are.
- Well, we want to assure you,

250
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,620
that when this place
becomes another Club Persh,

251
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,740
you will all still be 100% welcome.

252
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:49,003
All they want is to
make the place really nice.

253
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:53,456
We're going to put down some lovely
blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.

254
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:55,625
I knew it! I knew it!

255
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:57,242
But you are still welcome to come.

256
00:11:57,292 --> 00:12:01,608
My boss wants you to know that you will
not be discriminated against in any way.

257
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:04,349
Would you allow straight people in? Men?

258
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,203
Well... we would allow whoev-

259
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:10,007
Choose your next words wisely, Persian!

260
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:13,662
Look uhh, we don't have
to offer you anything, so...

261
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:16,458
I don't know why you're
being so difficult. This is crazy.

262
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:19,362
No, this isn't crazy.

263
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:23,388
This... is... Lesbos!

264
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:30,244
How dare you!

265
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,147
<i>And so it had begun.</i>

266
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:40,059
<i>By kicking the Persian messenger in the
balls, the lesbos had sent a message.</i>

267
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,609
<i>All over the country lesbians
heard of the brave standoff.</i>

268
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,272
<i>As a group of lesbians in Colorado</i>

269
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:50,695
<i>are refusing to allow
the new owners of their bar in.</i>

270
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:53,232
- Good for them!
- You go girls!

271
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,149
<i>The Persians returned to their office,</i>

272
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,996
<i>and told their coworkers how the thirty
lesbos were refusing to let them in.</i>

273
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,400
Well fine.
If they're going to block the entrance,

274
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,516
we'll just bring like, sixty of us!
I'll call more Persians for help.

275
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:31,618
<i>The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians
boldly stood out in front of their bar</i>

276
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,918
<i>to stop the Persians from entering.</i>

277
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,870
Here they come.

278
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,602
There's so many of them.

279
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:52,322
Lesbos! Positions!

280
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:00,080
Lesbians! Stand aside.
We're coming in to redecorate it!

281
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:04,516
The hell you are! You can take
your blue carpet and gold curtain rods

282
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:06,912
and shove them up
your Persian buttholes!

283
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:10,362
All right!
Come on! They can't stop all of us!

284
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,269
Lesbos! Remember this day!

285
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,408
Remember this fight!

286
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,599
Don't give them an inch!

287
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:39,437
Ow! Iranian faggot!

288
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,909
Come on, seriously, let us in!

289
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,165
Never!

290
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:50,043
<i>For hours,
the Lesbos kept the Persians back,</i>

291
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:53,505
<i>holding them off,
keeping them from decorating.</i>

292
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,050
<i>Finally the Persians grew tired,</i>

293
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,228
<i>and many of them wanted to go
shopping for more designer sunglasses.</i>

294
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:06,774
<i>They retreated.  The Lesbos... had held.</i>

295
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,693
Lesbohhhs!!

296
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,873
<i>The Persians who did not go shopping</i>

297
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:20,164
<i>now knew they must face their boss.</i>

298
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:21,490
Here he comes.

299
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:30,849
<i>Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer</i>

300
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,507
<i>with customized Gucci accessories which
only a Persian would think was cool.</i>

301
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,742
Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move.
We could not get inside to redecorate.

302
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:50,487
Tumon, how could you have
failed me in this simple task?

303
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:55,278
I am so seriously pissed off right now.
I could bust a testicle.

304
00:15:55,776 --> 00:16:00,303
<i>And with that the Persian
club owner came to a realization.</i>

305
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:04,674
I shall have to deal
with these lesbos myself.

306
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,763
Girls, I just want to say
that I am very proud of you.

307
00:16:12,965 --> 00:16:17,259
The way we kept those Persians
from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.

308
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:19,437
Well that's great, Janet, but what now?

309
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:22,025
We can't just stay here
pushing them away our whole lives.

310
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:23,868
We can't? I think it's pretty fun.

311
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,622
We have to have a more solid plan.

312
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:28,835
Something we can use
against them permanently.

313
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:32,061
Maybe we can dig up
some dirt on the club owner.

314
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:36,612
Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy.
We need somebody working on the inside.

315
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,875
Whattaya mean?

316
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,052
If we could get some
Persians on our side,

317
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:42,900
we could send them in to try
to dig up some dirt on the owner!

318
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,081
But who's gonna spy on them for us?
We don't know any Persians.

319
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:50,334
It's okay. There's people
you can hire for this kind of thing.

320
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,029
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?

321
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:58,703
Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

322
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:00,903
- Yeis.
- We looking work, sí.

323
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,577
All right. We need you to infiltrate
some Persians who run Club Persh,

324
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:07,327
and dig up some dirt on the owner.

325
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:09,217
Okay. Sure. Okay. Yeah.

326
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,729
Janet, how is this gonna work?
They don't look Persian.

327
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:13,128
Sure they do.

328
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,764
Just have to- gel the hair,

329
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:20,685
put on a silk shirt, some gold chains,

330
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,558
and tons of cologne.

331
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:26,140
Persian.

332
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,940
Sí.

333
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,719
Wow!

334
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,895
All right,
Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits

335
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:33,562
and see what you can find out.
The address is in there too.

336
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:35,861
Okay. No problem. Yes. Sí.

337
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:41,018
And Mexicans, please hurry.
Our girl bar has very little time.

338
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,909
<i>A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew</i>

339
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,681
<i>a second Persian attack was imminent.</i>

340
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:54,204
<i>Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch,
ready to alert the others.</i>

341
00:17:55,043 --> 00:17:58,394
<i>The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside.</i>

342
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,192
<i>>Her plan to dress Mexicans
as Persians to act as spies,</i>

343
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:03,881
<i>perhaps it had failed.</i>

344
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:08,647
<i>She looked around at her fellow Lesbos.
They were tired.</i>

345
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:13,002
<i>In order to keep her Lesbos awake,
she had no choice:</i>

346
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:15,202
<i>she would have to make coffee.</i>

347
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:40,607
<i>With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos
found new life, but would it be enough ?</i>

348
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:43,331
The Persians are attacking again!

349
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:46,950
- Take positions, Lesbos!
- Get outside!

350
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:50,972
No wait, wait! That's not the Persians,
it's the Mexicans.

351
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,986
- Really?
- How can you tell?

352
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:55,036
Let them through. It's okay.

353
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:57,012
- Hola, ¿Cómo estás?
- Hola.

354
00:18:57,062 --> 00:19:00,411
Did you uncover anything?
Are the Persians doing anything illegal?

355
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:03,792
Ahh, no. They're not
doing anything illegal.

356
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,514
A-are you sure??

357
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:09,531
No, but we did find out a kind
of secret about the Persian in charge.

358
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,731
What secret?!

359
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:16,125
- Oh my God, are you sure about this?
- Sí.

360
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:21,051
Janet ! Janet, the Persian boss is here.
He wants to talk to you and you alone.

361
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:25,940
It's okay. It's time I met
this rich Persian asshole face to face.

362
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,995
Why are you lesbians being so difficult?

363
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:38,348
Because we're protecting
the only home we have.

364
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,549
I don't know why you have
to be all superlame about this.

365
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,058
You know, a long time ago when
I first realized I was a lesbian,

366
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:47,289
I felt isolated, confused.

367
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:50,910
And finally I found a place
that accepts me for who I am.

368
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,815
Okay, how about this? I will
make you the manager of Club Persh.

369
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:58,366
You'll make good money.

370
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,460
That's a generous offers, Xerxes.

371
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,460
But you see,
there's something I know about you.

372
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:07,414
I know you're actually a woman.

373
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:09,817
How..?

374
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,529
How did you find that out?

375
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,937
I hired Mexicans to spy on you!

376
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:17,906
They saw you working out at Curves.

377
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:22,375
You don't understand. Women
can't be the boss in Persian culture.

378
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:24,322
Nobody can know about this.

379
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:28,964
Yeah. And you know why?
Because men are all assholes!

380
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:33,469
They make you feel ashamed for being
a little... big, or, manly looking.

381
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,244
But not Lesbos. We accept
other women for who they are inside!

382
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:41,541
You do? Seriously?

383
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:45,805
Have you never... even thought,
of being with another woman before?

384
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:50,936
No. I don't even know how two women...
can make love.

385
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:55,361
Unless they just kind
of  scissor or something.

386
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,378
Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!

387
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:03,052
Ohh, that feels so supercool!

388
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:06,532
- Yeah, scissor!
- Ohh, I'm a new woman!

389
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:10,537
<i>And so it was that Lesbos was saved.</i>

390
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:13,918
<i>The Persians had agreed
to leave it a lesbian bar,</i>

391
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,972
<i>for no dyke should be without cocktails.</i>

392
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:21,689
- Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
- No. Thank you, friend.

393
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,158
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be teaching school right now?

394
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,058
The school hired a
substitute to cover for me.

395
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:31,553
Hand so to find the
sum of the two fractions,

396
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:35,253
zhyou must always check
for the lowest common denominator.

397
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,830
Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. Sí.

398
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:39,204
These guys are pretty good.

399
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,563
Yeah. I think I'm actually
learning something.
