00:00:08,207 --> 00:00:11,485
<i>I'm going out to South Park
gonna have myself a time</i>

2
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:14,802
<i>Friendly faces everywhere
humble folks without temptation</i>

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:18,145
<i>I'm goin out to south park
gonna leave my woes behind</i>

4
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:21,492
<i>Ample parking day or night
people spouting howdy neighbor</i>

5
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:24,683
<i>I'm heading out to south park
to see if i cant unwind</i>

6
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:28,047
<i>I like girls with big fat titties
really big fat titties</i>

7
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,282
<i>So come on out to south park
and meet some friends of mine</i>

8
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:33,576
<i>Episode 11x02
"Cartman Sucks"</i>

9
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:36,578
This picture I like to call "The Pierre."

10
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:38,120
I invited Butters to stay the night.

11
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:42,021
And while he was sleeping I made
a mustache on his face with cat poo.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,625
And this time, when Butters stayed
the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.

13
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:48,709
I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual."

14
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,421
This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae."

15
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,673
I really like how the light plays with
the background on this one.

16
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:58,173
Is this all you brought us here to see?
- Oh no, there's much more.

17
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:01,532
Let's see. Oh yes, look at this one.
I call it "New Moon Rising."

18
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,743
I did a whole study using my ass.

19
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:06,330
Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.

20
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,273
Trying out some different light filters here.

21
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:13,290
But this is nothing compared
to what I have planned.

22
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,403
Because tonight is going
to be my coop de grass.

23
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,412
Butters is staying over tonight?
- Yes.

24
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:21,253
And tonight, while Butters is asleep,
I am going to-

25
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:23,081
Hey, fellas!

26
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:25,923
Oh, oh hey, Butters!
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

27
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:28,522
Yeah. I finished my chores
so I came over a little early.

28
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:32,302
Hey! Are you guys all sleeping over too?
- No, no, these guys were just leaving.

29
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:34,721
Weren't you guys?

30
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,803
Come on, let's go.

31
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:39,990
Wait, wait, I can't let this happen.

32
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:42,391
Butters.
- Yeah, Kyle?

33
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:46,190
Don't you think it's a little strange that
Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?

34
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:47,062
Kyle!

35
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:48,972
What do you mean?
- I mean, that if-

36
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:52,443
What he means is that he's jealous that
you've taken his place as my new best friend!

37
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:54,952
But grow up, Kyle!
Change is a part of life.

38
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:57,462
Yeah, grow up, Kyle.

39
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:02,790
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna
play a game or just chitchat for a while?

40
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:05,160
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd
better hit the hay pretty soon.

41
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:08,471
But, it's only 6:30.
- Yeah, and I'm exhausted.

42
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:12,663
If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more
of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.

43
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:18,343
You guys! I got it!
It seriously!

44
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,910
It's the greatest picture ever!
Oh my God!

45
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:23,703
What'cha do to Butters this time?
- It was genius!

46
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,912
I waited till he was totally asleep, right?

47
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,941
And then I got my camera
and I pulled down his pants

48
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:32,901
and then I took a picture
of his wiener in my mouth!

49
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,932
Dude!
- I know, I know, check it out, look.

50
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:40,623
I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see?
Oh man, I got him good!

51
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:43,173
Dude, how is putting Butters wiener
in your mouth getting him?

52
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:47,122
Because that makes Butters gay now!
- No dude, that makes you gay!

53
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,290
Eh... what?

54
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:52,093
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth,
that makes you gay, stupid!

55
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,853
Nuh uh.
- Yeah huh!

56
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:58,673
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
- That makes you very fucking gay.

57
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:01,473
But I'm not- I'm not gay, you guys!
- You are now.

58
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:04,892
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
- Doesn't matter. You're gay now.

59
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:07,253
No, it was just for a second!

60
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,462
What, what can I do?
How how can I reverse this?

61
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:10,942
You can't!
- No, wait.

62
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:13,412
I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
- How?

63
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:18,872
The only way you can cancel it out is to get
Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.

64
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:23,190
Really?
- Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.

65
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,321
Shit, I gotta find Butters!

66
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:29,061
Idiot.

67
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,931
Butters.
- Hey, Eric.

68
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:40,880
Butters, guess what?
I have a surprise for you.

69
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:44,813
A surprise? What is it?
- It's so fucking awesome.

70
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:47,763
You're gonna be soo stoked.
It's the best surprise ever!

71
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:48,970
Oh boy!

72
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,463
You ready?
- Yeah!

73
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:53,653
Okay! Just open your mouth and close
your eyes and and get on your knees!

74
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,091
Oh, okay!

75
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,722
Hang on a second here.
- How come uh, I can't see?

76
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:01,081
Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?
- Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:04,561
All right, that's good.
Okay, open your mouth, Butters?

78
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,660
That's good, just like that.
- Hey!

79
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,111
Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it?

80
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:12,942
Why you're not gonna, stick something
yicky in my mouth, are ya?

81
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:15,530
I swear on my mother's life, Butters.

82
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:17,913
I am not going to stick anything
yicky in your mouth.

83
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,172
Okay!

84
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,411
All right, you ready? All right just-
Okay, open. Okay, okay, here it comes.

85
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:25,372
Just sit very still, okay?
Here we go.

86
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:28,471
Butters!
- Hey Dad!

87
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:32,300
Butters! What are you doing?!
- I'm getting a surprise!

88
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:35,913
Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this!

89
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:37,412
Hey. Where'd Eric go?

90
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,022
Butters, how long have you been
doing stuff like this?

91
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:42,362
Like what?
- Don't lie to me, Butters!

92
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:43,833
I know your secret now!

93
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,760
No wait, wait. It's okay.
It's okay, Butters.

94
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:50,432
This isn't a serious problem.
You're just bi-curious.

95
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:53,743
What's bi-curious?
- You are.

96
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:56,513
Just harmless curiosity
and it doesn't mean anything.

97
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,340
We just need to get you some help, Butters.

98
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:02,381
What's going on, you two?
- Nothing mom, I'm just a little bi-curious.

99
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:07,823
Father Maxi, I just don't
know where else to turn.

100
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:11,710
You see, I've just learned
that my son is bi-curious.

101
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:16,063
Is that true, son?
Are you feeling confused?

102
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:19,001
Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
- You see?

103
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:22,052
Young man, these confused feelings
that you're having

104
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:25,820
are simply the devil's way of trying
to get a hold of you.

105
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,090
Really?
- What can I do, Father?

106
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,932
There is a special camp where young men
who are confused, like your son

107
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:34,583
can go and be cleansed by the power of God.

108
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:38,462
Many bi-curious boys come out
the camp completely cured.

109
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:42,810
A secluded camp where lots of bicurious
boys are all put together?

110
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:46,492
That sounds like a good idea.
- Whoa boy! Camp!

111
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:53,620
Very funny! I suppose
you really think you got me!

112
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:57,282
What are you talking about, fatass?
- I checked on the internet, Kyle.

113
00:05:57,317 --> 00:06:01,171
And getting Butters to put my wiener in his
mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!

114
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:03,173
You figured that out, huh?
- That's right.

115
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:07,041
And I also learned from the Internet that just
because I put Butters wiener in my mouth

116
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,390
doesn't mean I'm gay!

117
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,233
All I have to do is throw away the picture

118
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,321
forget it ever happened
and nobody will every know.

119
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:16,250
Except for us.
- Right, except for you.

120
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:18,602
And all the people we tell.

121
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:23,780
Why would you tell anybody?
- Because it's really, really funny.

122
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:26,953
It's not that funny. There's lots, there's
lots of things that are way funnier.

123
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,302
Like what?
- Like...

124
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:34,801
a tampon in the school cafeteria,
in somebody's lunch.

125
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:38,361
Like...

126
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:41,990
a dog crap, on a guy's face!

127
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,871
That isn't funny.
- Yes, it is!

128
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:47,473
Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off!
You'd better not tell anybody!

129
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,090
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.

130
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:52,760
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have
any proof I put Butters wiener in my mouth!

131
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,612
It will be your word against mine!

132
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:58,760
And we all know that everyone trusts me
way more than you guys!

133
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:02,773
You guys, please don't tell anybody.

134
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:07,090
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you
are supernice to us, every day, from now on.

135
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,651
Oh right, like that's possible!
Alright, fine!

136
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:13,283
You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?!
I'm gonna go home and photoshop the picture

137
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,630
so that it is your face with Butters wiener
in his mouth here!

138
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:20,873
And if any of you say anything to anybody,
I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.

139
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:27,442
<i>Camp New Grace
"Pray The Gay Away."</i>

140
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:31,940
Everyone, say hello to our
new camper, Butters.

141
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:34,192
Hi Butters. Hello.
- Hi. Hello Butters.

142
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,133
Thank you so much for taking him in.
- Don't worry.

143
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,460
Your son just needs to learn
that he can be straight if he chooses to be.

144
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:45,771
Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?
- Because I'm bi-curious?

145
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,905
That's right. Like all the campers here, you're
confused and you don't think there's a way out.

146
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,149
But even though some people would have
you believe you can't control how you feel

147
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:58,141
the truth is that with the power
of Jesus Christ you can be normal.

148
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,742
Now, just to make sure you
don't slip up while in camp

149
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:03,530
we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy.

150
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:05,983
Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy.

151
00:08:06,016 --> 00:08:07,950
Ryan thought he could never change.

152
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,870
But now he's learning that with
the power of Christ and prayer

153
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,250
he can have a whole new life.

154
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,090
Over this way we have the cafeteria.
All the meals are served there.

155
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:23,961
Bradley! How about you
be Butters' accountabilibuddy?

156
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:28,001
Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty
hand, that he may lift you up. Peter 5:6

157
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:31,580
Butters here is new to the camp.
He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction

158
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,350
and forge a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ.

159
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:35,830
I'm bi-curious.

160
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,680
Do not lie with a man as one lies with
a woman, that is detestible. Leviticus 18:22.

161
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:43,341
That's right, Bradley. I think we're
well on our way to being healed.

162
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,503
We've got another one, room 22.
- Oh, darnit!

163
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:54,221
Aw man, I've got H O R S now.
- Okay, my turn.

164
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,821
Where is it, you filthy jew?

165
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:00,260
Where's what?
- You know goddamn well what!

166
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:02,493
Let go of me.
- What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!

167
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:05,451
I went home to alter the picture of me with
Butters penis in my mouth to look like Kyle

168
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:06,541
but it was gone!

169
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:10,981
What did you do with my picture?!
- Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!

170
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:13,523
Give it back, Kyle!
- I don't have it!

171
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,733
I swear to God, Kyle,
if you don't give it back right now

172
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,773
I'm gonna break your fucking
Jew legs right here!

173
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,583
Shut up!
- You shut up!

174
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,211
You're lying and you two
are covering up for him!

175
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:24,790
You know what?
You're just like Jews yourselves!

176
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:29,103
Stan, you're a Jew and Kenny,
you're a Jew! You're all Jews!

177
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,492
<i>The Lord is love this for</i>

178
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:45,180
<i>With Jesus I can just say no
and not be confused anymore.</i>

179
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,820
We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips.

180
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,252
For those of you who are new to camp

181
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,953
Pastor Phillips is somebody who has
broken free of the bonds that afflict you.

182
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:56,043
He's bi-curious too?

183
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:59,041
Not anymore.
Because Pastor Phillips prayed

184
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,642
and by the hand of Jesus Christ
he's now completely cured!

185
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,520
Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!

186
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:09,150
Hello, campers!

187
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,683
Yes, believe it or not, I myself
used to have unclean urges

188
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:19,362
and like a lot of you I thought I was just
made that way, that I didn't have a choice.

189
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:23,131
But then I realized that God
didn't want me to be that way!

190
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,003
God wanted me to be a man!

191
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:29,303
So I buckled up in my little suit
and I prayed to be normal and guess what?

192
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,631
It worked!

193
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:35,712
That's right, kids. You see,
right now you're like a paper clip.

194
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:39,801
And just like a paper clip,
God needs to bend you and shape you

195
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,872
and make you straight.

196
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:50,321
<i>Park County
Police Station</i>

197
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:55,151
So you say you were robbed.
- Yes. A photograph.

198
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:58,233
And I know who took it!
His name is Kyle Broflovski!

199
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:01,812
If it's a photo, what's the big deal?
Why don't you just print out another one?

200
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:06,382
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is
my property and I want it back!

201
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,401
Okay, what is the picture of?

202
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,862
Why does that matter?

203
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:16,040
Well how are we gonna find your picture
unless we know what it is?

204
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:20,132
All right. It's a picture of me.
- Yes?

205
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:23,301
It's a picture of me...

206
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:27,360
and what appears to be a penis...

207
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,122
in my mouth.

208
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:34,463
You were sucking somebody's penis.
- No, no, I was not!

209
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:38,663
I was asleep and this person just puts a penis
in my mouth without me knowing!

210
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:40,320
And and took the picture!

211
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:42,453
I see.
- Yes.

212
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:46,860
Now it may appear in the picture that I'm
actually looking at the camera lens and smiling

213
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:49,813
with the penis in my mouth
and giving a thumbs up.

214
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:52,181
But I assure you, I was fast asleep!

215
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:55,601
Well we'd have to get a warrant first,
approved by a grand jury

216
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:58,401
I don't have time for that!
We have school tomorrow!

217
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:02,381
And I know that Kyle is gonna show the
picture to everybody during Show and Tell!

218
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:05,020
Well then, you're screwed.

219
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:10,982
You both do understand that we're trying
to save your souls from eternal life in hell?

220
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:12,320
Well sure, I guess.

221
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,172
Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.

222
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:19,201
And you do know the rule which states
that no impure or immoral images

223
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,231
are allowed to be seen by the eye?

224
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:22,423
Well yeah, sure.

225
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,002
So let's purify ourselves from everything
that makes the body or soul unclean.

226
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,042
Corinthians, chapter 7.

227
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:34,570
Then do you mind telling us why we found this,
1979 Sears mens underwear catalog in your room?

228
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:38,131
That's mine.

229
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,971
You know this is strictly forbidden!

230
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:42,762
Ah I don't understand.
What's wrong with underwear?

231
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:46,712
What's wrong?!
This is what makes you confused!

232
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:50,223
Don't you get it?!
This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!

233
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,393
Yes, it's all very confusing!

234
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:56,911
This is just as much your fault, Butters!
Bradley is your accountabilibuddy!

235
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:59,692
That makes you accountabilibuddyable.

236
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:03,211
Both of your boys behavior has jeopardizing
all of the work we're doing here

237
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:06,070
to save these kids!

238
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:16,763
Right. For having contraband in
your room, you will both do penance

239
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:19,931
by writing scripture for the next four days!

240
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:24,462
That son of a bitch. He's gonna
show everyone that picture.

241
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:26,512
Only twelve hours from now.

242
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:31,702
That's it. I don't have a choice.
I'm gonna have to bring mom in on this one!

243
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:34,130
I'm going to have to tell her the truth.

244
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:43,172
Eric? What's the, what's the matter?

245
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:47,593
I don't wanna go to school tomorrow.

246
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:51,460
Sweetie, tell mommy what happened.

247
00:13:51,676 --> 00:13:56,583
Kyle, has a picture of me and he's gonna
show everyone during Show and Tell.

248
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:59,673
And everyone's gonna laugh at me.

249
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:02,500
Oh, now why would he do that?

250
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:06,323
Because, he's jealous of how
much smarter I am than him.

251
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:10,042
So, he's gonna show everyone the picture.

252
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,670
What is the picture of, Eric?

253
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:19,253
Last time, when Butters spent the night,
I was being really nice to him

254
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:23,150
and I was gonna take a picture
of him for his mom to have.

255
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:24,873
Oh, that's nice.

256
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,203
But then, right when I took the picture,
Butters got really hot

257
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:32,011
so he pulled his pajama bottoms down
and then I tripped and fell down

258
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:35,761
and my mouth landed right on his penis
and then I thought of something funny

259
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:38,730
so I smiled up at, the camera
and gave like a, thumbs up

260
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:42,201
and then Kyle took the picture from me
and he's gonna show it to everybody

261
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:45,283
and make them think I'm gay.

262
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:49,333
Oh, there there, sweetie.
It'll be okay.

263
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,092
These things happen.

264
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:57,262
But, mom, I've been trying to get the picture
back, but he won't give it to me.

265
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,592
It's okay, Eric.
I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.

266
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:04,610
You will?

267
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:09,503
But that he loved us and sent his only son
to be the satisfaction of our sins.

268
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:10,892
Neato!

269
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:14,713
Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.
- Aw, that's okay, Bradley.

270
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,210
I really want to get better.

271
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:20,822
I try to do everything the counselors say,
but somehow I still feel confused.

272
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:23,313
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish
writing all these verses

273
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,063
we won't be bi-curious no more
and then we can go home!

274
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:30,223
You're really terrific, Butters.
I mean, I think you're great.

275
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:34,641
Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!

276
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:38,920
What's the matter?
- I think, I think I like you.

277
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:41,733
Well I like you too, Bradley.
- You do?

278
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,940
Well, yeah!
- You like like me?

279
00:15:43,988 --> 00:15:46,411
Sure, I like like you a lot a lot.

280
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:49,681
Oh God, we're both unfixable!
Don't you see we're lost causes?!

281
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,701
We're just evil and nothing can change us!

282
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:55,261
There's no other way out, Butters!
We have to kill ourselves!

283
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:59,791
No! Bradley! You can't leave,
you're my accountabilibuddy!

284
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:08,160
Hello?
- Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.

285
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,471
Oh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.

286
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:12,922
Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this

287
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:18,203
but apparently your son has a picture of Eric
with another boy's penis in his mouth.

288
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:21,811
Excuse me?

289
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:26,862
Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.

290
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:28,891
It is? Really?

291
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:31,532
Oh, mommy, thank you! Thank you!

292
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:34,113
You have nothing to worry about
in school tomorrow.

293
00:16:34,146 --> 00:16:38,491
Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle
doesn't have the picture.

294
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:39,981
What?

295
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,733
She talked with her son
and says he doesn't have it.

296
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,823
Mom, she's lying!
- She said she was sure, Eric.

297
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:50,542
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews!
They lie all the time!

298
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,860
Well, Eric, there's nothing more
I can do about it.

299
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,112
Then that's it. Kyle wins.

300
00:16:58,707 --> 00:17:00,291
But he won't win completely!

301
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:04,451
I'm going to print out another copy of that
picture and show it to the class myself!

302
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,950
I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh.

303
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:14,241
Do you mind telling me how you managed
to lose your accountabilibuddy?!

304
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:17,220
I went looking for him,
but he runs real fast.

305
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,872
You don't seem to take
this camp seriously, Butters.

306
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:23,402
I've called your father in for a talk.
- Oh no, my dad?

307
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:25,262
Do you understand the concept of hell?

308
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:29,730
Do you realize that if we don't fix you,
you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?

309
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,080
Well yeah, but I just don't quite
understand what you're fixing.

310
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:37,073
We're fixing your confusion!
- There you are, Butters!

311
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:39,631
Oh, hey dad.
- What's he done now?!

312
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:43,612
Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate,
unwilling to change and worse yet

313
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,941
he's lost his accountabilibuddy!

314
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:49,792
They found him! They found Bradley!
You'd better come quick!

315
00:17:56,925 --> 00:18:00,111
Oh Lord in Heaven!
Don't jump, Bradley!

316
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,282
Stay back!
I'm an abomination of God!

317
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:05,523
No, we're fixing you!

318
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:15,183
Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle?
To embarrass me in front of everyone?

319
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:18,302
Well guess what?
I'm not giving you the satisfaction!

320
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,392
Okay students, let's all take our seats.

321
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:25,213
Since it is Monday, we'll start
as always with Show And Tell.

322
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:27,592
Who'd like to go first?

323
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:28,992
Ow! Quit it, dude!

324
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,313
Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down.
You can go first.

325
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,903
For Show And Tell today, I would like
to share with you some very special,

326
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:45,853
very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit
of being a respected photographer.

327
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,690
This first picture I like to call
"Moods of Winter."

328
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:50,972
A simple aspen grove shot
in high-contrast black and white

329
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:54,921
shows the brittleness of the trunks
and reminds one of death.

330
00:18:56,827 --> 00:19:00,541
This picture I took just as the sun was rising
and this lonely man was walking to work.

331
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,701
A statement about all of
our loneliness, perhaps?

332
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:04,662
He isn't actually going to show everyone.

333
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:06,241
And now this next picture...

334
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:11,670
Don't jump, Bradley! You will
only make god angrier with you!

335
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:13,590
It's too late.

336
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:17,741
Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy.
How will this make me look?

337
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:19,882
You get back. You're only
gonna make things worse.

338
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:22,693
I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!

339
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:27,371
You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
- Get back! You're just as confused as he is!

340
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,640
All right. All right that does it!

341
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:34,040
I am sick and tired of everyone
telling me I'm confused!

342
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:38,082
I wasn't confused until other people
started telling me I was!

343
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:44,041
You know what I think? I think maybe
you are the ones who are confused!

344
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:45,182
Yeah.

345
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:49,422
I'm not gonna be confused anymore
just because you say I should be!

346
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:55,471
My name is Butters, I'm eight years old,
I'm blood type O and I'm bi-curious!

347
00:19:55,766 --> 00:20:01,341
And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious
and I'm somehow made from God.

348
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:05,871
Then I think your God must be
a little bi-curious himself!

349
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:13,391
I think. I think I'd like to come down now.

350
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,260
He's coming down! We did it!

351
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,812
Through the power of Christ
we have saved this child!

352
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:23,503
Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home.

353
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:27,570
Looks like you're never gonna change.
- No. I like being bi-curious.

354
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:31,333
Well you know something? So do I.

355
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:35,162
Wait. Now I am confused.

356
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:38,882
And this photograph I took of a sunset
near the power plant.

357
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,850
Note how the contrasting images make
a statement about our impact on the Earth.

358
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:46,330
Which brings us to my last picture.

359
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:50,923
This picture you may find somewhat controversial.

360
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:57,391
Dude.

361
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:01,082
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture
using a low-light filter.

362
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:03,022
You can see the grain from
the high-speed film...

363
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,833
there's sort of a penis in
my mouth right here...

364
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:07,190
and the low depth of field keeps
the background soft.

365
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:09,343
Eric, what the hell is this?!

366
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,140
What this is, is a statement
against the war in Iraq.

367
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:14,602
It's wrong that we still have
our troops there. It's wrong!

368
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,620
And what I think that-
- Eric Cartman?

369
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,643
We got an emergency message from your mother?

370
00:21:19,677 --> 00:21:24,211
<i>Do not show picture.
Kyle didn't have it after all.</i>

371
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,351
<i>Found it under your desk.</i>

372
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,163
She said you'd know what that means, mkay?

373
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,202
Lame.
