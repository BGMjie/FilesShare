<SYNC Start=36440 End=39079><P Class=ZHCC>
Ok children we have<br>a special guest today,
<SYNC Start=39240 End=42199><P Class=ZHCC>
a woman recruiting young<br>people for a national choir tour.
<SYNC Start=42360 End=44919><P Class=ZHCC>
Now I know that choir tours<br>are totally stupid and lame,
<SYNC Start=45080 End=47319><P Class=ZHCC>
but please give<br>her your full attention.
<SYNC Start=47600 End=50159><P Class=ZHCC>
- Go ahead.<br>- Uh, thank you Mr. Garrison.
<SYNC Start=50320 End=52199><P Class=ZHCC>
How are we all doing, today?
<SYNC Start=52199><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=53720 End=56519><P Class=ZHCC>
I can't hear you!<br>I said how are we all doing?
<SYNC Start=56519><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=58600 End=60319><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric Cartman, you say excuse me!
<SYNC Start=60319><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=61360 End=62189><P Class=ZHCC>
Go ahead.
<SYNC Start=62200 End=65799><P Class=ZHCC>
Children, we're a national<br>choir called Getting Gay with Kids.
<SYNC Start=65960 End=68294><P Class=ZHCC>
We're gonna do a big tour<br>down in Central America
<SYNC Start=68299 End=71399><P Class=ZHCC>
to help save the rainforest<br>and you can be a part of it.
<SYNC Start=71399><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=71901 End=73400><P Class=ZHCC>
This is fuckin stupid!
<SYNC Start=73400><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=74160 End=76159><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny McCormick, you<br>speak when you're spoken to!
<SYNC Start=76159><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=77560 End=78559><P Class=ZHCC>
Go ahead.
<SYNC Start=78760 End=81979><P Class=ZHCC>
You see, we take kids from all over<br>the country and put them in a choir,
<SYNC Start=82000 End=85519><P Class=ZHCC>
where they sing and dance to raise<br>awareness about our vanishing rainforests.
<SYNC Start=85680 End=88799><P Class=ZHCC>
Did you know over ten thousand acres<br>of rainforest are bulldozed every year?
<SYNC Start=88960 End=93039><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right and over thirty percent of the<br>world's oxygen is made in the rainforests.
<SYNC Start=93039><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=94080 End=96039><P Class=ZHCC>
So who wants to join the fun?
<SYNC Start=96200 End=98039><P Class=ZHCC>
- What if you don't have<br>any rhythm? - Excuse me?
<SYNC Start=98200 End=101199><P Class=ZHCC>
- Like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he<br>doesn't have any rhythm. - Shut up, fatass!
<SYNC Start=101360 End=103679><P Class=ZHCC>
Choirs suck! - Kyle Broflofsky,<br>you watch your language!
<SYNC Start=103840 End=106839><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!<br>Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!
<SYNC Start=107040 End=108999><P Class=ZHCC>
Kenny McCormick,<br>you pay attention!
<SYNC Start=109440 End=112039><P Class=ZHCC>
- Go ahead.<br>- Well that's all really.
<SYNC Start=112200 End=114759><P Class=ZHCC>
So if anyone is interested<br>in seeing the rainforest
<SYNC Start=114920 End=117239><P Class=ZHCC>
and joining our choir, I'll leave<br>information packets up front.
<SYNC Start=117400 End=119339><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, that's good. We need<br>some more toilet paper.
<SYNC Start=119339><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=119960 End=121479><P Class=ZHCC>
Alright! That does it!
<SYNC Start=121800 End=124559><P Class=ZHCC>
I am tired of seeing you<br>in my office, young man.
<SYNC Start=124620 End=127639><P Class=ZHCC>
You get sent here<br>every day, Craig. - I know.
<SYNC Start=127800 End=130359><P Class=ZHCC>
- Why can't you behave?<br>- I don't know.
<SYNC Start=130520 End=132239><P Class=ZHCC>
What do you have<br>to say for yourself?
<SYNC Start=132239><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=133560 End=135319><P Class=ZHCC>
Well I'll tell you<br>what young man,
<SYNC Start=135440 End=137879><P Class=ZHCC>
you're gonna be held<br>back a grade if you don't...
<SYNC Start=138080 End=139839><P Class=ZHCC>
- Did you just flip me off?<br>- No.
<SYNC Start=140000 End=141759><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes you did! You just<br>flipped me the bird!
<SYNC Start=141880 End=144159><P Class=ZHCC>
Now see, this is exactly<br>what I'm talking about!
<SYNC Start=144360 End=146639><P Class=ZHCC>
If you don't shape up, mmmkay,<br>and get your head straight...
<SYNC Start=146840 End=148799><P Class=ZHCC>
- There! You just flipped<br>me off again! - No I didn't.
<SYNC Start=148920 End=151591><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes you did! And until<br>you stop flipping people off,
<SYNC Start=151593 End=154439><P Class=ZHCC>
you can just go back to the<br>waiting room, mmmkay! Next!
<SYNC Start=154439><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=155320 End=156359><P Class=ZHCC>
Well well well.
<SYNC Start=156520 End=158359><P Class=ZHCC>
If it isn't Stan, Kyle,<br>Kenny, and Eric?
<SYNC Start=158520 End=160999><P Class=ZHCC>
- Hi Craig. - Hey, don't<br>flip me off, you sonofabitch!
<SYNC Start=161160 End=164799><P Class=ZHCC>
Sit down boys. Now let's see, what<br>did Mr. Garrison send you in here for?
<SYNC Start=165080 End=167220><P Class=ZHCC>
"The boys were being rude<br>while a choir teacher
<SYNC Start=167222 End=169221><P Class=ZHCC>
was giving some<br>stupid presentation."
<SYNC Start=169320 End=171239><P Class=ZHCC>
It's just some dumb<br>activist kids choir thing!
<SYNC Start=171400 End=174359><P Class=ZHCC>
Young man, Getting Gay with<br>Kids is not dumb, mmmkay!
<SYNC Start=174520 End=176799><P Class=ZHCC>
It just so happens that I'm<br>on the board of directors.
<SYNC Start=176960 End=178377><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, all those choirs are the same.
<SYNC Start=178379 End=180678><P Class=ZHCC>
They don't even really sing.<br>They use prerecorded tapes.
<SYNC Start=180760 End=184199><P Class=ZHCC>
Well guess what boys, I think Getting<br>Gay with Kids is just what you need.
<SYNC Start=184360 End=186079><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm gonna sign<br>up all four of you.
<SYNC Start=186240 End=187719><P Class=ZHCC>
- What?<br>- You can't do that!
<SYNC Start=187719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=190440 End=192359><P Class=ZHCC>
I think this will be<br>very good for you.
<SYNC Start=192520 End=194039><P Class=ZHCC>
But we don't even care<br>about the rainforests.
<SYNC Start=194200 End=196759><P Class=ZHCC>
And that's exactly why<br>you need to go, mmmkay.
<SYNC Start=196920 End=198532><P Class=ZHCC>
Please, Mr. Mackie,<br>we'll be good,
<SYNC Start=198534 End=202003><P Class=ZHCC>
don't send us to that old kid<br>choir, have mercy Mr. Mackie.
<SYNC Start=202003><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=203200 End=206239><P Class=ZHCC>
Be safe Kyle. Bring me<br>something back from the rainforest.
<SYNC Start=206440 End=208439><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh no no no. The<br>rainforest is very fragile.
<SYNC Start=208600 End=211519><P Class=ZHCC>
We must take only pictures<br>and leave only footprints.
<SYNC Start=211680 End=212839><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, I didn't realize.
<SYNC Start=213000 End=215088><P Class=ZHCC>
Did you know that<br>right now bulldozers
<SYNC Start=215090 End=217889><P Class=ZHCC>
are tearing down thousands<br>of acres of rainforest everyday?
<SYNC Start=217920 End=220719><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah man, this is gonna<br>suck donkey balls!
<SYNC Start=220760 End=222879><P Class=ZHCC>
Please don't make me go<br>on a choir tour, mom, please!
<SYNC Start=223040 End=226819><P Class=ZHCC>
Stan, you should be excited. I<br>would love to see the rainforest.
<SYNC Start=226880 End=228599><P Class=ZHCC>
Besides, your dad and<br>I need some time alone.
<SYNC Start=228660 End=229719><P Class=ZHCC>
No!
<SYNC Start=229719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=233280 End=234839><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay children,<br>that's all of us.
<SYNC Start=235000 End=238559><P Class=ZHCC>
We're ready to head to the<br>Latin American nation of Costa Rica,
<SYNC Start=238720 End=241199><P Class=ZHCC>
a country filled with<br>virgin rainforests.
<SYNC Start=241199><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=243120 End=245879><P Class=ZHCC>
And you must be Eric Cartman.<br>I've heard about you.
<SYNC Start=246040 End=248319><P Class=ZHCC>
You don't respect nature<br>or other cultures.
<SYNC Start=248480 End=249719><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, pretty much.
<SYNC Start=249880 End=252199><P Class=ZHCC>
Well I'm gonna change<br>the way you think kiddo.
<SYNC Start=252199><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=252920 End=254959><P Class=ZHCC>
My name is Kelly.<br>- My name is Kenny.
<SYNC Start=255080 End=256479><P Class=ZHCC>
Lenny?<br>- No, Kenny!
<SYNC Start=256520 End=257959><P Class=ZHCC>
Johnny?<br>- KENNY!
<SYNC Start=258320 End=259999><P Class=ZHCC>
Now we've got a<br>long trip ahead of us,
<SYNC Start=260020 End=262999><P Class=ZHCC>
so let's take the opportunity<br>to learn our choreography.
<SYNC Start=263160 End=264679><P Class=ZHCC>
The nightmare begins.
<SYNC Start=264679><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=274000 End=278939><P Class=ZHCC>
Look children, I think we're entering San<br>Jose, which is the capital of Costa Rica.
<SYNC Start=279240 End=281239><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh this is so exciting!
<SYNC Start=281720 End=284159><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God, dude, look how<br>dirty and crappy everything is.
<SYNC Start=284280 End=287199><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, Costa Rica is a<br>third world country.
<SYNC Start=287360 End=289799><P Class=ZHCC>
These people are much<br>poorer than those in the US.
<SYNC Start=289920 End=291359><P Class=ZHCC>
Well why the hell<br>don't they get jobs?
<SYNC Start=291359><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=292520 End=295114><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey why don't you people<br>quit slacking off and get a job?
<SYNC Start=295116 End=297839><P Class=ZHCC>
What's wrong with you?<br>Go to college. - Eric, sit down!
<SYNC Start=298040 End=299719><P Class=ZHCC>
Look, you gotta be<br>firm with these people
<SYNC Start=299721 End=301920><P Class=ZHCC>
or they just slack off and be<br>poor forever, right Kenny?
<SYNC Start=302280 End=304819><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny,<br>maybe you're Costa Rican,
<SYNC Start=304821 End=307220><P Class=ZHCC>
that's why your family is so<br>poor. - You fuckin asshole!
<SYNC Start=307240 End=308639><P Class=ZHCC>
Your family isn't poor?
<SYNC Start=309040 End=310399><P Class=ZHCC>
Whoa dude, look over there!
<SYNC Start=310600 End=312479><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow, Costa Rican prostitutes!
<SYNC Start=312640 End=314359><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, look at the<br>prostitutes you guys!
<SYNC Start=314359><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=317360 End=321519><P Class=ZHCC>
- What are you looking at, man?<br>- Yeah, why don't you take a picture?
<SYNC Start=321840 End=322839><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=322839><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=323920 End=325239><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, sit down!
<SYNC Start=325239><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=327160 End=329479><P Class=ZHCC>
Kids, this is the Costa<br>Rican capital building.
<SYNC Start=329640 End=332679><P Class=ZHCC>
This is where all the leaders of the<br>Costa Rican government make their...
<SYNC Start=332840 End=334679><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God, it smells<br>like ass out here!
<SYNC Start=334840 End=335839><P Class=ZHCC>
Alright, that does it!
<SYNC Start=336000 End=338359><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric Cartman, you respect<br>others cultures this instant!
<SYNC Start=338520 End=341919><P Class=ZHCC>
I wasn't saying anything about their culture,<br>I was just saying there city smells like ass.
<SYNC Start=342080 End=345959><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow! Seeing a place like this makes<br>you appreciate living in America, huh?
<SYNC Start=345959><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=347400 End=350319><P Class=ZHCC>
You may think that making fun of third<br>world countries is funny but let me...
<SYNC Start=350480 End=352938><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't think it's funny! This place<br>is overcrowded, smelly, and poor!
<SYNC Start=352940 End=355438><P Class=ZHCC>
That's not funny, that sucks!<br>- Eric, will you please, PLEASE,
<SYNC Start=355460 End=359079><P Class=ZHCC>
keep your mouth shut while we present<br>ourselves to the Costa Rican President.
<SYNC Start=359240 End=362319><P Class=ZHCC>
- Why? - Cause I'll buy you some<br>ice cream afterwards if you do.
<SYNC Start=362640 End=366159><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, it was a very long trip, but the<br>children are very excited to sing tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=366159><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=367680 End=368719><P Class=ZHCC>
Que?
<SYNC Start=369080 End=372799><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, we're the choir that was<br>sent from the United States.
<SYNC Start=372799><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=374360 End=375079><P Class=ZHCC>
Que?
<SYNC Start=375240 End=378919><P Class=ZHCC>
We're the group singing for the<br>save the rainforest summit tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=378919><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=381040 End=383159><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh dear, where's Mr. Mackie?<br>He should have been here by now.
<SYNC Start=383320 End=384839><P Class=ZHCC>
Children, do any of<br>you speak Spanish?
<SYNC Start=384839><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=385840 End=388119><P Class=ZHCC>
- Don't you dare!<br>- Sorry I'm late.
<SYNC Start=388280 End=391279><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, thank goodness you're here, I don't<br>speak any Spanish. - Oh no problem.
<SYNC Start=391440 End=394399><P Class=ZHCC>
Ustedas choir de estados<br>unidos, mmmbien?
<SYNC Start=394560 End=396559><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, oh, save the rainforest.
<SYNC Start=396559><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=399480 End=402639><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, he says Pablo here will<br>take you on a rainforest tour.
<SYNC Start=402800 End=406479><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh boy! Mr. Presidente,<br>round up your subjects outside.
<SYNC Start=406640 End=410399><P Class=ZHCC>
We have a special gift<br>for you, the gift of song.
<SYNC Start=410399><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=413320 End=416119><P Class=ZHCC>
Alright children, let's get in our<br>rows quickly so we can begin.
<SYNC Start=416600 End=419419><P Class=ZHCC>
Did you remember all the<br>choreography, Lenny? - Yeah, I think so.
<SYNC Start=419440 End=422519><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello everybody. This is just a<br>little rehearsal for tomorrow,
<SYNC Start=422680 End=424419><P Class=ZHCC>
so we may be a little rusty.
<SYNC Start=424419><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=429280 End=432599><P Class=ZHCC>
There's a place that is<br>magical and full of rain,
<SYNC Start=432760 End=436039><P Class=ZHCC>
but now it needs<br>help because it is in pain.
<SYNC Start=436200 End=439199><P Class=ZHCC>
Cleaning the earth<br>is a mighty big chore.
<SYNC Start=439360 End=442639><P Class=ZHCC>
We're spreading awareness<br>like never before.
<SYNC Start=442639><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=444480 End=447399><P Class=ZHCC>
Getting Gay with Kids is here.
<SYNC Start=447560 End=450359><P Class=ZHCC>
Spread the word<br>and bring you cheer.
<SYNC Start=450840 End=454039><P Class=ZHCC>
Let's save the<br>rainforest, what do you say?
<SYNC Start=454200 End=457519><P Class=ZHCC>
Being an activist is totally gay.
<SYNC Start=457519><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=458600 End=462199><P Class=ZHCC>
And someday if we work<br>hard, boys and girls,
<SYNC Start=462199><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=464560 End=469479><P Class=ZHCC>
they'll be nothing but rainforest<br>covering the entire world.
<SYNC Start=469479><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=470880 End=473919><P Class=ZHCC>
Getting Gay with Kids is here.
<SYNC Start=473919><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=474560 End=476399><P Class=ZHCC>
Spread the word<br>and bring you cheer.
<SYNC Start=476399><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=477560 End=481479><P Class=ZHCC>
Getting Gay with Kids is here.
<SYNC Start=481640 End=485719><P Class=ZHCC>
Save the rainforest,<br>totally gay, totally gay!
<SYNC Start=485719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=489320 End=490479><P Class=ZHCC>
Great job, gang!
<SYNC Start=490640 End=492844><P Class=ZHCC>
- You were really all over<br>the place, Kyle. - Thanks.
<SYNC Start=492880 End=495359><P Class=ZHCC>
- I told you Jewish people don't<br>have rhythm! - Fuck off, Cartman!
<SYNC Start=495520 End=499879><P Class=ZHCC>
No, dude, I think Cartman might actually<br>be right! - No, that's a stereotype.
<SYNC Start=500040 End=502799><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, maybe you really<br>don't have any rhythm!
<SYNC Start=502799><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=506360 End=509039><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, secondary<br>rainforest we are entering.
<SYNC Start=509200 End=510899><P Class=ZHCC>
Notice the canopy of foliage.
<SYNC Start=510920 End=513799><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh! It's everything I've<br>ever dreamed it would be!
<SYNC Start=513960 End=514999><P Class=ZHCC>
God damn, it's hot out here!
<SYNC Start=515360 End=516479><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah! Snake!
<SYNC Start=516640 End=518199><P Class=ZHCC>
No, dude, that's a branch.
<SYNC Start=518360 End=519319><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh... Ah! Snake!
<SYNC Start=519480 End=521119><P Class=ZHCC>
No, that's the same branch again.
<SYNC Start=521480 End=525479><P Class=ZHCC>
The rainforest is very delicate and<br>we must take steps to protect it.
<SYNC Start=525640 End=527759><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah yeah yeah, take steps,<br>we're taking them, blah blah blah.
<SYNC Start=527759><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=529240 End=531079><P Class=ZHCC>
We heard this a million<br>times back up in the states.
<SYNC Start=531240 End=532999><P Class=ZHCC>
Here look!<br>These are squirrel monkeys,
<SYNC Start=533200 End=535519><P Class=ZHCC>
endangered inhabitants<br>of the rainforest.
<SYNC Start=535880 End=537319><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny?
<SYNC Start=537520 End=538759><P Class=ZHCC>
Bad! Bad monkey!
<SYNC Start=538880 End=540439><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric! What the<br>hell are you doing?
<SYNC Start=540600 End=542559><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm asserting myself.<br>It's tough love.
<SYNC Start=542600 End=544495><P Class=ZHCC>
Just like my little Kitty.<br>When he's bad, I'll say:
<SYNC Start=544497 End=547496><P Class=ZHCC>
"that's a bad little Kitty"<br>and I smack him on the head.
<SYNC Start=547600 End=549839><P Class=ZHCC>
And here is a three-toed sloth.
<SYNC Start=550000 End=551719><P Class=ZHCC>
That's a bad... That's a<br>bad three-toed sloth!
<SYNC Start=551880 End=553479><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric! For God's sake,<br>knock it off!
<SYNC Start=553640 End=555439><P Class=ZHCC>
Respect my autoritay!
<SYNC Start=555760 End=558719><P Class=ZHCC>
Well Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour,<br>but I guess we should be heading back,
<SYNC Start=558880 End=561759><P Class=ZHCC>
we have a big concert<br>tomorrow, don't we kids?
<SYNC Start=562240 End=565119><P Class=ZHCC>
- I wish we could have seen the<br>Yanagapa. - What's the Yanagapa?
<SYNC Start=565240 End=568319><P Class=ZHCC>
The Yanagapa are gentle native<br>people that live in the rainforest,
<SYNC Start=568480 End=571959><P Class=ZHCC>
but bulldozers are destroying their homes.<br>Soon they will have nowhere to go,
<SYNC Start=572120 End=574519><P Class=ZHCC>
so we must stop bulldozing the<br>rainforest so that they can live...
<SYNC Start=574519><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=575120 End=576719><P Class=ZHCC>
God, here she goes again!
<SYNC Start=576719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=577720 End=579519><P Class=ZHCC>
- Stanley, what is it?<br>- Snake!
<SYNC Start=579519><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=580760 End=582759><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah, yes, this is what<br>we call a coral snake.
<SYNC Start=582880 End=585119><P Class=ZHCC>
Notice the red markings.<br>Quite an amazing creature.
<SYNC Start=585119><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=586240 End=587359><P Class=ZHCC>
What's the matter little boy?
<SYNC Start=587520 End=589999><P Class=ZHCC>
- He's a little wuss, what's it look<br>like? - I'm just scared of snakes.
<SYNC Start=590120 End=594119><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, now. You must remember, this snake<br>is more afraid of you than you are of it.
<SYNC Start=594119><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=598240 End=599239><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God!
<SYNC Start=599239><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=601120 End=603119><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh yeah. That snake is<br>really scared of us, alright.
<SYNC Start=603119><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=604880 End=606479><P Class=ZHCC>
Jesus Christ, is he dead?
<SYNC Start=606479><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=608440 End=609519><P Class=ZHCC>
My guess would be yes.
<SYNC Start=609640 End=611879><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh no! God, no!<br>Now, don't panic children!
<SYNC Start=611879><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=612760 End=614999><P Class=ZHCC>
Bad! That's a bad snake!
<SYNC Start=614999><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=618000 End=619359><P Class=ZHCC>
Maybe we came from that way.
<SYNC Start=619520 End=621519><P Class=ZHCC>
No, no, let's try this way.
<SYNC Start=621519><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=622120 End=625439><P Class=ZHCC>
Benny, do you think we're gonna<br>be okay? - Yeah, everything is fine.
<SYNC Start=625480 End=627659><P Class=ZHCC>
That's good. Can I tell<br>you something? - Okay.
<SYNC Start=627760 End=629509><P Class=ZHCC>
I think I like you.<br>- Really?
<SYNC Start=629520 End=632959><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate<br>really well. - Oh! That's great!
<SYNC Start=633080 End=634939><P Class=ZHCC>
No, it's not good.<br>- That's not good?
<SYNC Start=634960 End=638239><P Class=ZHCC>
No. See, if I start to like you too much,<br>I'm only gonna get my heart broken,
<SYNC Start=638360 End=639999><P Class=ZHCC>
'cause we like on<br>opposite ends of the country.
<SYNC Start=640120 End=642439><P Class=ZHCC>
Once this choir tour is over, we<br>will never see each other again.
<SYNC Start=642600 End=644026><P Class=ZHCC>
And that would devastate me!
<SYNC Start=644028 End=647027><P Class=ZHCC>
So I can't have any feelings<br>for you, I just can't, Lenny!
<SYNC Start=647027><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=648320 End=651479><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh children, the sun is setting. We<br>have to find our way out of here quick!
<SYNC Start=651479><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=658240 End=661319><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay, Okay!<br>Everything is just fine kids.
<SYNC Start=661480 End=664039><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, it is important that<br>we all stick together.
<SYNC Start=664240 End=666239><P Class=ZHCC>
Is everybody still here?
<SYNC Start=666239><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=666840 End=668999><P Class=ZHCC>
- I'm not.<br>- Who's not?
<SYNC Start=669160 End=670199><P Class=ZHCC>
Me.
<SYNC Start=670199><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=671160 End=672799><P Class=ZHCC>
Benny, will you hold my hand.
<SYNC Start=672799><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=673760 End=675479><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't wanna get<br>emotionally attached, though.
<SYNC Start=675640 End=677559><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God, dude!<br>I just saw Tony Danza!
<SYNC Start=677720 End=680079><P Class=ZHCC>
No, you didn't just see<br>Tony Danza, Stanley!
<SYNC Start=680079><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=721520 End=723749><P Class=ZHCC>
Dude, we're totally lost.<br>We're gonna die out here!
<SYNC Start=723760 End=726495><P Class=ZHCC>
- We are?! - Don't worry Kelly,<br>we're gonna find our way out
<SYNC Start=726500 End=729079><P Class=ZHCC>
of the rainforest and make<br>it back to the concert in time.
<SYNC Start=729240 End=733279><P Class=ZHCC>
We just need to respect our mother<br>rainforest and she will respect us.
<SYNC Start=733440 End=735079><P Class=ZHCC>
Mrs. Stevens. You have<br>a bug on your back.
<SYNC Start=735240 End=736919><P Class=ZHCC>
Really? Could<br>you brush it off?
<SYNC Start=736919><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=738240 End=739619><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, No.
<SYNC Start=739619><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=740800 End=741999><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God! Get it off me!
<SYNC Start=742280 End=745799><P Class=ZHCC>
For the love of God!<br>Get it off me! Oh my God!
<SYNC Start=745799><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=746640 End=748959><P Class=ZHCC>
Okay children,<br>we must understand
<SYNC Start=749020 End=753439><P Class=ZHCC>
that the insects of the rainforest<br>help the delicate balance of life here.
<SYNC Start=753439><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=755680 End=757839><P Class=ZHCC>
- Rainforests suck,<br>I wanna go home! - Me too!
<SYNC Start=757839><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=760960 End=764879><P Class=ZHCC>
Children, Okay! Let's try to listen<br>to what the rainforest tells us,
<SYNC Start=765040 End=768559><P Class=ZHCC>
and if we use our ears, she<br>can tell us so many things...
<SYNC Start=768720 End=769879><P Class=ZHCC>
There's a dude here!
<SYNC Start=770040 End=771919><P Class=ZHCC>
Ah thank goodness! Hello sir!
<SYNC Start=772160 End=774599><P Class=ZHCC>
We are lost!<br>Can you help us?
<SYNC Start=774599><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=776000 End=776999><P Class=ZHCC>
Que?
<SYNC Start=777160 End=778199><P Class=ZHCC>
Let me try. Let me try.
<SYNC Start=778360 End=780719><P Class=ZHCC>
We are from America,<br>A-mer-i-ca.
<SYNC Start=781080 End=782879><P Class=ZHCC>
We are lost and very hungry.
<SYNC Start=783040 End=784799><P Class=ZHCC>
Neccesito burrito...
<SYNC Start=784960 End=786759><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't wanna burrito,<br>I wanna taco. Supreme.
<SYNC Start=786920 End=789319><P Class=ZHCC>
- Y taco... - I want two<br>tostados in mild sauce.
<SYNC Start=789480 End=792239><P Class=ZHCC>
Two tostados in... en charida.
<SYNC Start=792400 End=795719><P Class=ZHCC>
Boys! Please! Not every Spanish person<br>eats tacos and burritos, that's a stereotype.
<SYNC Start=795719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=796920 End=798839><P Class=ZHCC>
Children, he wants us to follow him.
<SYNC Start=799000 End=802159><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, thank goodness!<br>I think this ordeal is over!
<SYNC Start=802159><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=804880 End=807359><P Class=ZHCC>
- This doesn't look very safe. - Yeah, I<br>think we should get the hell out of here.
<SYNC Start=807520 End=810350><P Class=ZHCC>
Now kids, let's be a bit more open<br>minded. I read all about this in Newsweek,
<SYNC Start=810352 End=813785><P Class=ZHCC>
I read all about this in Newsweek,<br>this is a people's army,
<SYNC Start=813790 End=816799><P Class=ZHCC>
they're fighting the fascist policies<br>of their fascist government.
<SYNC Start=817200 End=820559><P Class=ZHCC>
- Oh, hello! Do you speak English?<br>- Who are you?
<SYNC Start=820720 End=825159><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh wonderful! We were lost and it is a<br>such a great coincidence we found you!
<SYNC Start=825320 End=828319><P Class=ZHCC>
You see, we're here to protest the<br>government sanction raping of your rainforest.
<SYNC Start=828319><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=829960 End=833399><P Class=ZHCC>
We are fighters just like you! Could<br>you help us get back to San Jose?
<SYNC Start=833399><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=835280 End=837419><P Class=ZHCC>
Um, I know! Perhaps<br>you would like a gift.
<SYNC Start=837480 End=841719><P Class=ZHCC>
I have only one gift<br>to give. The gift of song.
<SYNC Start=841719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=846040 End=848919><P Class=ZHCC>
There's a place that is<br>magical and full of rain...
<SYNC Start=849080 End=851959><P Class=ZHCC>
Kyle, for the love of God,<br>do the right choreography.
<SYNC Start=851959><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=852720 End=855799><P Class=ZHCC>
Cleaning the earth<br>is a mighty big chore.
<SYNC Start=855960 End=858719><P Class=ZHCC>
We're spreading<br>awareness like never before.
<SYNC Start=858719><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=859240 End=860879><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, Kyle! Please!
<SYNC Start=861080 End=863959><P Class=ZHCC>
Getting Gay with Kids is here...
<SYNC Start=864120 End=864799><P Class=ZHCC>
Enough!
<SYNC Start=864960 End=867919><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, we hope our gift of<br>song has warmed your hearts.
<SYNC Start=868080 End=870519><P Class=ZHCC>
We're not getting gay<br>with any kids, okay!
<SYNC Start=870680 End=873239><P Class=ZHCC>
Uh, yeah. So, do you<br>have a phone we could use?
<SYNC Start=873560 End=877559><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes, we have a phone. It's right over<br>there, next to the twelve person jacuzzi.
<SYNC Start=877559><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=881040 End=882959><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, get out of<br>here before we kill you.
<SYNC Start=883320 End=886319><P Class=ZHCC>
Is it because of the little<br>Jewish boy's choreography?
<SYNC Start=886640 End=888519><P Class=ZHCC>
You white Americans make me sick!
<SYNC Start=888680 End=891439><P Class=ZHCC>
You waste food, oil, and everything<br>else, because you are so rich.
<SYNC Start=891600 End=892971><P Class=ZHCC>
And then you tell<br>the rest of the world
<SYNC Start=892973 End=895972><P Class=ZHCC>
to save the rainforest because<br>you like it's pretty flowers.
<SYNC Start=895972><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=903240 End=904559><P Class=ZHCC>
Run! Children! Run!
<SYNC Start=904559><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=921600 End=925519><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello! Anybody?! Help!
<SYNC Start=925680 End=927119><P Class=ZHCC>
Wow! Look at the pretty flower!
<SYNC Start=927280 End=930639><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, no, no, no, Jake that<br>fragile flower is very delicate, okay.
<SYNC Start=930639><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=934960 End=937319><P Class=ZHCC>
I wanna go home!<br>I hate the rainforest!
<SYNC Start=937319><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=939640 End=942839><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, Lenny, hold me!<br>No, I can't get attached.
<SYNC Start=943120 End=944599><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, but I do like you.
<SYNC Start=944760 End=946939><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, but you're only going<br>to leave me. - God damn it!
<SYNC Start=946939><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=947640 End=951308><P Class=ZHCC>
We're here live in San Jose, Costa<br>Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans
<SYNC Start=951340 End=953579><P Class=ZHCC>
have gathered for the<br>Save the Rainforest Summit.
<SYNC Start=953680 End=955504><P Class=ZHCC>
Everyone is here so they can<br>feel good about themselves
<SYNC Start=955506 End=958505><P Class=ZHCC>
and act like they aren't the ones<br>responsible for the rainforest's peril.
<SYNC Start=958680 End=961679><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right, Bob, and of course<br>the main attraction today
<SYNC Start=961880 End=964279><P Class=ZHCC>
the darling kids choir,<br>Getting Gay with Kids,
<SYNC Start=964440 End=967279><P Class=ZHCC>
all of whom must be backstage<br>preparing at this very moment.
<SYNC Start=967279><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=968840 End=972479><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, there's just no end to this place!<br>I think maybe we're going in circles.
<SYNC Start=972640 End=975759><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh! Dear God! The summit starts<br>in an hour! I'm gonna lose my job.
<SYNC Start=975759><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=976680 End=979639><P Class=ZHCC>
This is bullcrap! I am not following<br>this stupid hippie around anymore!
<SYNC Start=979800 End=981759><P Class=ZHCC>
- Eric, where are you going?<br>- I'm going this way.
<SYNC Start=981920 End=985159><P Class=ZHCC>
Young man, I am the adult here,<br>and I say you go this way!
<SYNC Start=985320 End=988559><P Class=ZHCC>
Look, you can stay over myah,<br>but I'm going over myah.
<SYNC Start=988720 End=990399><P Class=ZHCC>
Young man, I have had it!
<SYNC Start=990560 End=992639><P Class=ZHCC>
No no no no no no! You myah.
<SYNC Start=992800 End=995799><P Class=ZHCC>
Screw you<br>guys, I'm going home.
<SYNC Start=995960 End=998919><P Class=ZHCC>
Good! You deserve to<br>die, you little bastard!
<SYNC Start=998919><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=999840 End=1001439><P Class=ZHCC>
Eric, we have to stay together!
<SYNC Start=1001600 End=1004908><P Class=ZHCC>
God damn stupid hippie activist!<br>I should be home, nestled in the couch
<SYNC Start=1004910 End=1008039><P Class=ZHCC>
with my little Kitty right now,<br>watching Fat Abbot cartoons and...
<SYNC Start=1008039><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1009160 End=1011439><P Class=ZHCC>
Yes! I knew it! I'm saved!
<SYNC Start=1011680 End=1014159><P Class=ZHCC>
- Hey, maybe Cartman was right.<br>- Yeah, it happened once before.
<SYNC Start=1014320 End=1017959><P Class=ZHCC>
No, the spirit of Maya has<br>told me to go this way.
<SYNC Start=1018120 End=1019839><P Class=ZHCC>
Mister, you gotta help me,<br>I'm starvin' to death!
<SYNC Start=1020000 End=1021199><P Class=ZHCC>
What are you<br>doing here, little boy?
<SYNC Start=1021240 End=1023157><P Class=ZHCC>
I was with my class, and we<br>got all lost in the rainforest,
<SYNC Start=1023159 End=1024858><P Class=ZHCC>
and I need some<br>food, I'm fading fast!
<SYNC Start=1024960 End=1027559><P Class=ZHCC>
Lost in the rainforest? Oh my<br>Lord! Where are all the others?
<SYNC Start=1027760 End=1029959><P Class=ZHCC>
Food! I have to have food!
<SYNC Start=1029959><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1031040 End=1033399><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh my God! Get this<br>child some food quick!
<SYNC Start=1033560 End=1035599><P Class=ZHCC>
- Chicken wings.<br>- Chicken wings!
<SYNC Start=1035720 End=1036639><P Class=ZHCC>
Medium spicy.
<SYNC Start=1036639><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1038480 End=1040559><P Class=ZHCC>
Start the show! Start<br>the show! Start the show!
<SYNC Start=1040559><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1069200 End=1072439><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're<br>never gonna make the festival!
<SYNC Start=1072560 End=1073999><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey look over there!<br>Isn't that smoke?
<SYNC Start=1073999><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1075480 End=1076559><P Class=ZHCC>
Let's go, quickly!
<SYNC Start=1076559><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1077520 End=1079679><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey, it's a fire. That<br>means there must be people.
<SYNC Start=1079679><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1082760 End=1084799><P Class=ZHCC>
Children! It's the Yanagapa!
<SYNC Start=1085160 End=1088879><P Class=ZHCC>
Do not be afraid. We are not<br>here to tear down your rainforest.
<SYNC Start=1088879><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1091560 End=1094199><P Class=ZHCC>
Look how they live in<br>peace with all living things,
<SYNC Start=1094280 End=1095639><P Class=ZHCC>
gentle, noble...
<SYNC Start=1095639><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1096920 End=1098279><P Class=ZHCC>
Run for you lives, children!
<SYNC Start=1098440 End=1099439><P Class=ZHCC>
Holy crap!
<SYNC Start=1099439><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1101680 End=1102519><P Class=ZHCC>
Jesus Christ!
<SYNC Start=1102680 End=1104039><P Class=ZHCC>
Run! Run! Run!
<SYNC Start=1104039><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1112480 End=1113759><P Class=ZHCC>
- What the hell?<br>- We're sinking!
<SYNC Start=1113795 End=1115679><P Class=ZHCC>
It's quicksand!
<SYNC Start=1115679><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1123440 End=1125029><P Class=ZHCC>
All we ever heard<br>while growing up was:
<SYNC Start=1125031 End=1126310><P Class=ZHCC>
"save the rainforest",<br>" the rainforest is fragile".
<SYNC Start=1126320 End=1127859><P Class=ZHCC>
Yeah, fragile my ass!
<SYNC Start=1127880 End=1130519><P Class=ZHCC>
Larry, if we make it out of this,<br>I want to be your girlfriend,
<SYNC Start=1130680 End=1134239><P Class=ZHCC>
